<h2>The energy first created by a waterfall has returned to this Mill City entertainment district.</h2>

The pedestrian-only Stone Arch Bridge connects the mill area to St.

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The Falls of St. Anthony wasn't a very tall waterfall.</p>
<p>But it was broad and thundering, and the only major drop on the
Mississippi.</p>
<p>More importantly, it got good PR from two best-selling travel guides,
Father Louis Hennepin's 1683 &quot;Description de la Louisiane&quot; and Jonathan Carver's 1778
&quot;Travels through the Interior Parts of North-America,&quot; both of which
exaggerated its height.</p>
<p>Other explorers came, and in the 1820s ordinary tourists followed the
first steamboats up the Mississippi, where they admired the falls,
gawked at the Dakota living in nearby tepees and dined on such Wild West
delicacies as buffalo, elk and sturgeon.</p>
<p>But even then, early entrepreneurs were laying plans to harness the
power of the falls. By the 1870s, stone mills crowded the falls.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In 1880, Minneapolis took the flour-milling crown from St. Louis. Its
Washburn &quot;A&quot; mill, the largest and most advanced in the world, could
produce nearly 2 million pounds of flour a day.</p>
<p>In 1883, railroad tycoon James J. Hill built the gracefully curving
Stone Arch Bridge, which brought wheat from the Red River Valley right
to the doors of the flour mills.</p>
<p>The industry began to decline after World War I, and Minneapolis was
supplanted as the nation's largest producer of flour by Buffalo, N.Y.</p>
<p>By the 1960s, the riverbanks and Nicollet Island were shabby and
neglected.</p>
<p>Minneapolis was more enthralled by its new, pedestrian-friendly Nicollet
Mall, which stretched away from the river, and then by the modern
buildings along it: the blue-glass IDS tower, which became the city's
tallest building in 1973, and Orchestra Hall, opened in 1974 at the
mall's far end.</p>
<p>But the river banks began to come back in the 1980s. The restored brick
storefronts of St. Anthony Main led the river renaissance. Although the
shops have disappeared, its cinema, restaurants and walking paths still
are a magnet.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_mill_ruins.jpg" alt="Mill City Museum courtyard." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The ruins of the Washburn A Mill are part of Mill City Museum, which
uses its open courtyard for events.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>An 1887 trestle bridge leads to Nicollet Island, where the limestone
Nicollet Island Inn, built in 1893 as the Island Door and Sash Co., was
refurbished and opened in 1982 with a glass-lined restaurant and bar.</p>
<p>On one end of the 48-acre island is a cavernous pavilion, once an 1893
steam plant.</p>
<p>On the other end of the island, houses have been restored into colorful
showplaces, from a 1886 purple Queen Anne with teal trim to a yellow
1867 Greek Revival and the 1875 limestone Grove Street Flats, now
condos.</p>
<p>A shady cobblestone pathway, lined by cottonwoods planted by a pioneer
entrepreneur, follows the river from Nicollet Island to Water Power
Park, tiny Father Hennepin Park and the Stone Arch Bridge.</p>
<p>Once slated for demolition, the bridge is one of the most beloved spots
in the city. Open only to pedestrians, bicyclists and trolleys, it
provides an unparalleled view of the falls and both sides of the river,
and plaques explain milling history.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The west side of the river was developed more recently. In 1991, a fire
nearly destroyed the Washburn A Mill, but the ruins became part of Mill
City Museum.</p>
<p>Run by the Minnesota Historical Society, it features the eight-story
Flour Tower, milling exhibits and baking demonstrations. On weekends,
guides lead riverfront walking tours and costumed History Players make
appearances as historical figures.</p>
<p>Next door, the cantilevered lobby of the Guthrie Theater stretches
across West River Parkway. The striking building opened in 2006, and its
unusual interior is filled with gawkers both night and day.</p>
<p>From Mill Ruins Park, it's a pleasant walk or bicycle ride up riverside
paths to the Hennepin Avenue suspension bridge.</p>
<p>It's an unusually elegant span for such a short stretch, but it's an
important spot: The first-ever bridge over the Mississippi was built
here in 1855.</p>
<p>The path continues up the west side of the river to the Plymouth Avenue
bridge and across to Boom Island Park. From there, a tiny 1901 trestle
bridge crosses the channel back to Nicollet Island.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_gold_medal_park.jpg" alt="The Guthrie and Gold Medal Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Guthrie Theater, with its cantilevered lobby, sits next to the old
mills.

<p>One of the liveliest neighborhoods in Minneapolis is just across the
channel and beyond the 1857 Lady of Lourdes Church, whose steeple is a
Minneapolis landmark.</p>
<p>Once a tired-looking neighborhood of Eastern European Ã©migrÃ©s, many of
whom had moved on by the 1980s, northeast Hennepin Avenue now is lined
by boutiques, cafes, coffeehouses and nightclubs.</p>
<p>New condos and townhouses have gone up, drawing affluent empty-nesters
from the suburbs.</p>
<p>But its heritage lives on at Kramarczuk's, where stout matrons dish up
borscht and pierogies, and whose aromatic sausage counter has been
supplying homesick Ã©migrÃ©s since 1954.</p>
<p>From any sidewalk, the skyscrapers of downtown Minneapolis can be seen,
pointing to the sterile fate this little neighborhood escaped.</p>
<p>Today, this east-side stretch is called the Mississippi Mile. But it may
as well be called the miracle mile.</p>
