<h2>Summer is one long festival in this unsung city on Lake Michigan.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/polka_police.jpg" alt="Polka police at Milwaukee's Polish Fest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Once, I thought of Milwaukee as the ugly duckling of Midwest cities, a
colorless runt with the grit of Chicago but none of its allure.</p>
<p>Silly me.</p>
<p>It's true that downtown Milwaukee, during the day, is not exactly
flashy.</p>
<p>It's best to drive right past its dumpy gray office buildings,
bypassing even the popular Milwaukee Public Museum on the way to the
neighborhoods between the Milwaukee River and the shores of Lake
Michigan.</p>
<p>For it's here that this blue-collar city, built upon beer, motorcycles
and farm implements, reveals its appeal.</p>
<p>Along the lake, a visitor finds miles and miles of lakeshore trails,
cutting through wooded bluffs and into secluded blufftop parks, and
unpretentious streets lined by the manors of early industrialists.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At lake's edge, sunbathers gather on beaches, boaters at marinas and
ball-players on expansive fields. Bicyclists whiz by on the Oak Leaf
Trail.</p>
<p>Tourists gather to watch the &quot;wings&quot; of the Milwaukee Art Museum
open and close, and the 90-acre Maier Festival Park draws hundreds of
thousands to music festivals and ethnic celebrations that go on all
summer long.</p>
<p>Ten blocks to the west, people promenade along the three miles of
downtown's Riverwalk, listen to free concerts outside Marcus Center for
the Performing Arts and visit the theaters, brewpubs and restaurants
that line the river.</p>
<p>Just to the south, in the Historic Third Ward, an urban crowd frequents
a revived neighborhood of bistros, galleries and more theaters. And
handsome American Family Field, the former Miller Park, attracts
baseball fans with its old-style atmosphere and retractable roof.</p>

<p>Surprise, surprise — Milwaukee is fun, with big-city assets ensconced
in a cozy, small-town setting.</p>
<p>&quot;Milwaukee tends to be undersung, partly because the glare from Chicago
is kind of bright,&quot; says historian John Gurda, author of &quot;The Making
of Milwaukee.&quot;</p>
<p>Milwaukeeans, he says, have built their city on the concept of <em>Gemütlichkeit</em>, opting for congeniality
over glamour every time. He calls the town &quot;a reluctant metropolis.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Its self-image is as a smaller town than it actually is,&quot; he says.
&quot;We've got huge industries here, and a population that once was 11th
largest in the nation (now 31st). But it's maintained, for better or
worse, a big-small-town image.&quot;</p>
<p>Most visitors are drawn first to the Milwaukee Art Museum, which, with a
striking addition designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava,
often is called America's version of the Sydney Opera House.</p>
<p>The museum is most famous for Calatrava's bright-white brise soleil, a
sun shade that unfolds like a pair of wings three times daily, but its
collection also is superb. Sculptures by Duchamp, Picasso, Arp and Leger
sit in spotlit gloom in front of floor-to-ceiling windows, competing
with a sweeping view of the lake just outside.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's a top-notch collection of German Expressionists, a quirky
gallery of folk art and rooms full of exquisite 15th-century carved
altarpieces.</p>
<p>And yet even in these refined surroundings, there's a collection of
turn-of-the-century beer steins and oils of Bismarck-era bourgeois
Germany, a nod to the ethnic group so closely identified with Milwaukee.</p>
<p>These days, Milwaukee's identity as a German town is shifting. Once
known as Beer City, Suds City and Brew Town, it has just one big brewery
left, Miller. Pabst closed in 1997, though in 2017 it opened a brewpub
in part of the historic brewery complex, where it makes small batches of
craft beer.</p>
<p>Microbreweries have stepped into the gap. Sprecher offers tours of its
Glendale brewery and has built a reputation for its stouts, bocks and
lagers. On the Milwaukee River, Lakefront's tours are very popular, and
the two have been joined by more than two dozen other breweries and
brewpubs.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_fonz.jpg" alt="Milwaukee's statue of the Fonz." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Henry Winkler's character "The Fonz" greets visitors to the
riverfront.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Milwaukee's German contingent is still strong — German Fest each July
is the nation's largest celebration of German heritage — but Asians,
Hispanics and African-Americans have added new segments to the ethnic
patchwork.</p>
<p>This patchwork is celebrated every summer in a dizzying succession of
festivals: Scottish Fest, Juneteenth, Polish Fest, Bastille Days, Festa
Italiana, African World Festival, Arab World Fest, Irish Fest, Mexican
Fiesta, Indian Summer Festival.</p>
<p>Historian Gurda attributes this emphasis on ethnicity to the early
arrival of the city's Germans, who sank civic roots before the Yankees
arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;They made it OK to be different, OK not to be fitting tightly into an
ethnic mold,&quot; he says. &quot;In Milwaukee, more than in other cities, the
areas of diversity are celebrated as well as tolerated.&quot;</p>
<p>For gays and lesbians, there's PrideFest in June, and Harley riders
roll in over Labor Day weekend for the annual Milwaukee Rally.</p>
<p>The Harley-Davidson Museum has appealed to Milwaukee's appeal; for
Harley owners around the nation, says Gurda, &quot;It's become a religious
experience to come here.&quot;</p>
<p>The young and hip also make their presence felt. When I was there one
weekend, they were hopping between the bars and bistros of Jefferson
Street, the theaters and brewpubs along cobblestoned Riverwalk and
restaurants on picturesque Old World Third Street, a remnant of the old
German downtown.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Actually, there were people everywhere. Families were trooping through
the gold doors of the Pabst Theater. A bus was unloading teen-agers in
front of the Riverside Theater, where jazz musician Pat Metheny was
performing.</p>
<p>At Marcus Center for the Performing Arts, the Milwaukee Symphony
Orchestra's performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony was sold out.</p>
<p>In recent years, Milwaukee has rediscovered and refurbished its
riverfront, drawing suburbanites into downtown.</p>
<p>At night, lights now turn the ugly duckling into a swan, with the
cupolas, domes and gables atop downtown roofs bathed in spotlights,
pedestrian bridges lined by twinkle lights and the neon of brewpubs and
marquees reflecting off the river.</p>
<p>It's just living up to its name, Potawatomi for &quot;gathering place by the
waters.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Things have certainly come to life,&quot; Gurda says. &quot;We're kind of on a
roll.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Milwaukee and its festivals</h3>
<p><em>When to go:</em>  In April, the Brewers open at home, and the retractable
roof of American Family Field makes games comfortable in any weather.
Summer means non-stop festivals, and fall is lovely, with leaf color
lasting into early November.</p>

<p><em>Getting around:</em> During festivals, the <a href="https://www.ridemcts.com/">Milwaukee County Transit
System</a> runs a shuttle down Wisconsin Avenue
and straight to the gate.</p>
<p><a href="https://thehopmke.com/">The Hop streetcar</a> travels a two-mile loop
around downtown, connecting the Third Ward to Cathedral Square along
Broadway and Milwaukee streets and traveling north along Jackson Street
to Ogden Avenue and Burns Commons near the lake. It's free.</p>

in many locations downtown, near the lake and along the Milwaukee River
Greenway.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations:</em> Wisconsin Avenue hotels are a good bet because
they're on the shuttle route to the festival grounds (and also to the
Brewers games). They include:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marquette.edu/orl/conference/">Marquette University's</a>
Straz Tower, at the edge of downtown, or Mashuda Hall, next to the Pabst
Mansion, are good budget choices. Rooms are air-conditioned and have
private baths. Some have a refrigerator, microwave and cable TV. Call

was acquired by Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer. Today
it is part of Molson Coors.</p>
