<h2>During the holidays, this glittering, festive town becomes the City of Broad Smiles.</h2>

<p>Visiting Chicago during the holidays, I'm always bowled over by how
merry everyone is.</p>
<p>Can it be . . . Chicago Nice? It's either that or pixie dust.</p>
<p>Chicago is an exciting place to be any time, but at Christmas, it pulls
out the stops. The Magnificent Mile sparkles. Ice skaters do pirouettes
in Millennium Park. There are free concerts everywhere.</p>
<p>The first year I went, I headed for the Museum of Science and Industry
and its &quot;Christmas Around the World&quot; exhibit of 50 trees, each
decorated by a different Chicago cultural group.</p>
<p>The Scots had used gold-wrapped crackers, the Slovenes glazed bread
hearts, and the Swedes had covered their tree with straw stars; each
tree was a window into the soul of a country.</p>
<p>Dusk was falling as I arrived at the Christkindlmarket in Daley Plaza. I
expected it to be only a pale copy of the open-air Christ-child fairs
held in German squares for 500 years, but it turned out to be lifted
wholesale from the old country.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There were 35 timber lodges, many manned by German vendors with German
wares, right down to the fresh stollen and sausages made locally from
recipes and ingredients brought from Germany, where people know how to
celebrate Christmas.</p>
<p>I walked from kiosk to kiosk, looking at glass ornaments from Lauscha
and hand-carved nutcrackers and toys from the Erzgebirge, inhaling the
aroma of warm sugared almonds sold in cones.</p>
<p>I watched the steady stream of people at the Glühwein stand and asked
proprietor Marian Zeh if Americans liked the hot spiced wine.</p>
<p>&quot;No, most people don't like it, it's too salt and pepper,&quot; she said.
Highly spiced? &quot;Yes, and too <em>alkoholisch,</em>&quot; she said. I bought one anyway, along
with its ceramic mug; it was delicious.</p>
<p>One Berlin-born Chicagoan, Eva Esposito, was buying an armful of
multilayered <em>Baumkuchen,</em>  &quot;like pound
cake, only better.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_christkindlmarket_eating.jpg" alt="Eating potato pancakes at Christkindlmarket." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Christkindlmarket, shoppers gobble hot potato pancakes with
applesauce and sour cream.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;This is really beautiful,&quot; she said. &quot;It brings back memories, after
being here 40 years. And it's nice to speak German for a change.&quot;</p>
<p>The next day, I walked through the Gold Coast and up Oak Street, with
its boutiques: Hermes. Prada. Jimmy Choo and Wolford, where I splurged
on a pair of black-and-gold Austrian hose, perfect for holiday parties.</p>
<p>At the end of Oak, Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile began. I walked
past the stone Gothic Fourth Presbyterian, a beautiful church that
offers free noontime concerts every Friday, to the castellated Water
Tower, circled by horse-drawn carriages and red trolley buses.</p>
<p>The next time I visited Chicago over Christmas, I read on the plane
about the Apollo Chorus, which has been performing Handel's
&quot;Messiah&quot; in Chicago since 1879.</p>
<p>As soon as we arrived at our hotel, I went online and saw it would be
performing that afternoon a few blocks away, in the Faberge-egg
Orchestra Hall on Michigan Avenue. What luck!</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We bought tickets and settled in, but were puzzled when we saw the tiny
orchestra and read in the program that the soprano was . . . a student?
But then the huge chorus stood up with a whoosh, as if jet-propelled,
and suddenly we were hearing &quot;Messiah&quot; in gorgeous surround-sound.</p>
<p>Young soprano Amanda Majeski had a huge voice, muscular yet demure, and
the impassioned chorus filled every molecule of that hall with soaring
music. So much for the grumbling.</p>
<p>It was the most emotional rendering we'd ever heard; every great
&quot;Messiah&quot; will make you weep, and this one did.</p>
<p>Then we made the rounds of our favorite museums, the Shedd Aquarium and
the Art Institute. At Water Tower Place, we ate at Foodlife, a  maze of
kiosks that each sells a different kind of food.</p>
<p>The Christkindlmarket was much more crowded than I'd remembered, and
more expensive. The famous Kathe Wohlfahrt of Rothenburg, Germany, has a
permanent shop there, filled with baskets of glittering glass ornaments,
but the prices were too steep for me.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_ice_skating.jpg" alt="Skating in Millennium Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

beloved Cloud Gate sculpture.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Instead, I went to a vendor from Rossdorf, Germany, and bought a
hand-painted pewter ornament. My husband bought $40 worth of German
chocolates, cookies and hard candies, long-lost childhood favorites, at
the Sweet Castle lodge.</p>
<p>We had just enough time before our plane left on Monday to run to the
Leonidas shop, where we bought many ribboned boxes of chocolates shipped
in from Belgium.</p>
<p>At Christmas, Chicago is a sweet place. I can't wait to restock — not
just the goodies, but also the memories.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Chicago at Christmas</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> If your town is served by a low-cost airline, it's
easiest to fly into Midway Airport and take the Orange train downtown.
<a href="http://www.amtrak.com/">Amtrak</a> and the
<a href="http://www.megabus.com/us">Megabus</a> also are good options.</p>
<p><em>Spending money:</em> For tips, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/cheap-chicago/">Cheap
Chicago</a>. If you want
a hotel deal, the week before Christmas, when all the business travelers
are at home, is an excellent time to visit.</p>

<p>I like to stay in the Loop, near the river, Millennium Park and the
Chicago Cultural Center. My favorite hotel, the <a href="http://clubquarters.com/chicago/wacker-at-michigan">Club Quarters on
Wacker</a>, is half a
block off Michigan overlooking the Chicago River. Try to get a tower
room.</p>
<p>The high-rise <a href="https://www.sonesta.com/us/illinois/chicago/royal-sonesta-chicago-riverfront">Royal Sonesta Chicago
Riverfront</a>
is next door and also has good views. The <a href="http://www.monaco-chicago.com/">Hotel
Monaco</a> is just around the corner on
Wabash; it's stylish and has very comfy beds, but it's close to the
El, where trains squeak as they make a turn, so stay in one of the upper
floors.</p>
<p>Two historic hotels are a little farther south in the Loop. The <a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/illinois/palmer-house-a-hilton-hotel-CHIPHHH/index.html">Palmer
House
Hilton</a>
is on Monroe between Wabash and State, and the 1910
<a href="https://www.theblackstonehotel.com/">Blackstone</a> is on Michigan, three
blocks south of the Art Institute.</p>
<p>There are also several hostels with lower-priced rooms. For more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/hotels-motels/best-hotels-chicago/">Where to stay in
Chicago</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dining:</em> <a href="http://www.thegagechicago.com/">The Gage</a>, a popular and
convivial restaurant and pub, is on Michigan Avenue between Orchestra
Hall and the Cultural Center. Reserve in advance, 312-372-4243.</p>
<p>There are many inexpensive but good spots on Michigan between the Art
Institute and the river, including Caffe Baci, Cosi and the Corner
Bakery.</p>
<p>Of course, there's also good German food at Christkindlmarket: potato
pancakes, brats and strudel.</p>
<p><em>Information:</em> <a href="http://www.explorechicago.org">Chicago tourism</a>,
877-244-2246. The Cultural Center, on Michigan Avenue across from
Millennium Park, has the latest information and makes a good first stop.</p>
