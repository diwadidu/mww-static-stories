<h2>A cluster of family attractions make the city's unsavory origins a distant memory.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_paul_rice_park.jpg" alt="The Landmark Center in St. Paul." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Gangsters and FBI agents once frequented the Federal Courts Building,
now the Landmark Center.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's ironic, considering its past, that St. Paul is such a wholesome
destination.</p>
<p>Liquor brought the first white resident to Minnesota's capital; he was
Pierre Parrant, a swinish, one-eyed former voyageur named Pig's Eye. He
set up his first tavern near Fort Snelling, but was rousted in 1837 by
officers who were tired of the trouble it caused.</p>
<p>The hovel he built in a cave down river was St. Paul's first building,
and the area around the tavern he built later, in the future downtown,
was known briefly as Pig's Eye.</p>
<p>But missionaries were close on the heels of sin. One of them,
French-speaking priest Lucien Galtier, was able to rename the little
settlement after his log chapel, St. Paul's.</p>
<p>The town grew along the river as a transportation center, at first
faster than its flour-milling rival across the river, and was made the
state capital.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Its most impressive buildings went up on the hills around downtown. The
marble-domed Capitol, modeled after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, was
finished in 1905.</p>
<p>In 1915, the copper-domed Cathedral of St. Paul went up on the opposite
(and higher) hill, across the street from railroad baron James J.
Hill's 1891 mansion on Summit Avenue.</p>
<p>Sin made a memorable reappearance in the 1920s and '30s, when corrupt
police officials allowed St. Paul to become a haven for gangsters,
including John Dillinger, Alvin &quot;Creepy&quot; Karpis, Ma Barker, Baby
Face Nelson.</p>
<p>Today, St. Paul is known as the friendlier, less glamorous of the Twin
Cities, perhaps because of its strong neighborhoods and quieter
downtown. For tourists, especially those with children, it's a good base
for explorations.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_paul_cathedral.jpg" alt="Cathedral of St. Paul." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Cathedral of St. Paul is open to visitors who want to admire its
magnificent vaulted interior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Many of St. Paul's prime attractions are within a few blocks of each
other. The Science Museum of Minnesota, at the top of the bluff,
overlooks the Padelford Riverboat landing, from which paddlewheelers
cruise up and down the Mississippi, and the picnic areas and playgrounds
of Harriet Island.</p>
<p>Two blocks away, on Rice Park, the turreted stone Federal Courts
Building where FBI agents once stood with machine guns now is the
Landmark Center, home of many arts organizations and cultural festivals
honoring the city's many ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Rice Park is an intimate, European-style square, ringed by impressive
buildings: the elegant, contemporary Ordway Center for the Performing
Arts; the 1916 Beaux Arts central library; and the elegant 1910 Saint
Paul Hotel.</p>
<p>A bronze statue of F. Scott Fitzgerald stands there, coat over arm, as
well as a pigtailed girl in a fountain. Ice sculptures fill the
park.during Winter Carnival, a huge city celebration started in 1886 in
response to a New York City reporter's gibe that St. Paul was &quot;the
Siberia of North America.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On the other side of the Ordway, home of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra
and host of touring Broadway shows, are a trio of venues that bring
thousands to downtown.</p>
<p>The Roy Wilkins Auditorium is a mid-size concert hall; Riverfront Centre
is a convention center that hosts many crafts and hobby shows; and the
glass-lined Xcel Energy Center is a state-of-the-art concert arena and
home of the Minnesota Wild hockey team.</p>
<p>On a nearby hill, between the Capitol and the Cathedral, the imposing
1993 Minnesota History Center holds all kinds of hands-on exhibits for
kids. Costumed History Players - children's-book author Wanda Gag,
musher and mail carrier John Beargrease, teacher Harriet Bishop — give
regular programs.</p>
<p>On the other end of downtown, the History Theatre stages original plays
and musicals, and the purple-and-red building of the Minnesota
Children's Museum occupies a block nearby.</p>

<p>There still are saloons in St. Paul, where, in 1882, Mark Twain observed
that whiskey is &quot;the earliest pioneer of civilization.&quot;</p>
<p>But St. Paul, especially for families, has come a long way since then.</p>
