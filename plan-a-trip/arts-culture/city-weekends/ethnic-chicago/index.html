<h2>From Chinatown to Andersonville, these colorful neighborhoods are a window into other worlds.</h2>

<p>One Memorial Day weekend, my friend Grace and I went to tour
&quot;ethnic&quot; Chicago. But we'd only been there a few hours before we
realized <em>everything</em> about Chicago is
ethnic.</p>
<p>Chicago is a mosaic, a city of neighborhoods settled by waves of
immigrants who arrived to dig its waterways, build its railroads and
work in its slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>One of its first neighborhoods was Bridgeport, settled by Irish canal
workers in the 1840s and the stronghold of Mayor Richard J. Daley and
his son Richard M. Daley, the current mayor.</p>
<p>It was followed by Little Italy, Germantown, the Swedish enclave of
Andersonville, Polish Village, Ukrainian Village, Chinatown, Greek Town,
Bronzeville, the East Indian zone on Devon Avenue and Pilsen, a Czech
quarter that now is heavily Hispanic.</p>
<p>Over the years, these neighborhoods have shifted and changed.
Hard-working immigrants rode their business thoroughfares straight into
the suburbs and were replaced by new immigrants.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In Andersonville, towheaded children play around the window boxes of a
Persian restaurant near the Swedish American Museum. In Pilsen, the
century-old Lithuanian church holds Masses in Spanish.</p>
<p>In India Town, the Croatian Cultural Center is flanked by the Delhi
Darbar Kabab House and Gitel's Kosher Bakery.</p>
<p>Today, each neighborhood exudes the colors, smells and sounds of many
nationalities, not one. Still, our ethnic-Chicago excursion gave us a
good reason to venture beyond the Loop.</p>
<p>And when we arrived at our first destination, India Town, we felt as if
we'd jumped not just the river, but the ocean.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm looking around, and I don't see anyone who's not Indian,&quot; said
Grace, whose parents emigrated from India. &quot;How often would you have
this experience in the Midwest?&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_andersonville_tourism.jpg" alt="A tour group in Andersonville." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Choose Chicago</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Swedish American Museum is the pillar of Andersonville.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Walking along, we looked up at the street signs and noticed that Devon
Avenue had become Honorary Sheikh Mujib Way. Then Mohammed ali Jinnah
Way. Then Gandhi Marg.</p>
<p>Women in saris and men, some in turbans, walked past store windows
filled with jewelry, silk tunics, Bollywood videos and trays of brightly
colored pastries.</p>
<p>Most successful Indians now live in the suburbs, but this is where they
come to shop — and spend.</p>
<p>&quot;See, this is the kind of store you'd see in India,&quot; Grace said wryly
as we walked into Devi Jewelry. &quot;This is one of the reasons people
would come here; they go out to lunch and then buy themselves some
diamonds.&quot;</p>
<p>An Indian man stood in the middle of the shop, good-naturedly watching
as his wife and daughter huddled over the glass cases.</p>
<p>&quot;I never have any fun here,&quot; he said with a rueful smile. &quot;I get
pulled in.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/n/andersonville_midsommar.jpg" alt="Dancing around the Maypole at Midsommarfest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Midsommarfest in Andersonville, there's dancing around the Maypole.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Grace had to walk away from the $450 ring she was offered for $300,
having no clue about whether she should bargain further.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the thing about being first-generation American; you lose half
your culture,&quot; she said. But at Taj Sari Palace, many of the richly
colored silk saris were marked half-price, and she found a purple tunic
and matching flared pants.</p>
<p>Nearby, a large black man, slated to be best man at an Indian friend's
wedding, tried valiantly to fit into a cream brocade suitcoat.</p>
<p>It was Saturday, and the sidewalks were filled with shoppers. In a
bakery, we inspected fudgelike squares of green and pumpkin-colored
paste, pistachio balls topped with silver foil and spongy bright-yellow
patties.</p>
<p>In the corner, a woman was spooning brown liquid into a hollowed-out
pastry puff she called pani puri.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At the chat, or snack, counter, we ordered chai and split an order of
samosas, chickpeas, yogurt, mint chutney and sev, which resembles tiny
chow-mein noodles.</p>
<p>&quot;From what I understand, this is street food,&quot; Grace said. &quot;This is a
very Indian thing to do: Take a rest and drink tea after all your hard
shopping.&quot;</p>
<p>From India Town, we took the bus south to Andersonville, not expecting
to see many remnants of the former Swedish community.</p>
<p>In the window of the Swedish American Museum, a flier advertised the
twice-monthly Skandinavisk Happy Hour at a nearby bar.</p>
<p>At the Swedish Bakery, we bought a box of the chewy European almond
tarts and horns that are so hard to find in this country. It's gone
now, replaced by Lost Larson bakery, which specializes in Swedish breads
and cakes.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chinatown_food_tour.jpg" alt="A food-tour stop in Chinatown." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The Ann Sather and Svea cafes had closed for the day, so we got back on
the bus to Belmont and had dinner at the Ann Sather restaurant, known
for its rosemaled walls and copious comfort food. My Swedish-born
grandmother would've approved.</p>
<p>For the hamburger-and-fries crowd, eating may be the best way to become
acquainted with another culture.</p>
<p>The next day, we headed south on the Red line to Chinatown and joined a
horde at the Phoenix restaurant, known for its dim sum. As soon as we
were seated, Chinese women arrived wheeling carts of bite-sized food on
saucers and in bamboo baskets.</p>
<p>Since we wanted to try nearly everything, and the women seemed
disappointed if we didn't choose something, we soon found ourselves
surrounded by pork balls, potstickers, shrimp rolls and sweet sesame
buns.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to be more strategic and make them show us more stuff,&quot; Grace
concluded.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Summoning the shreds of our appetites, we ordered a plate of the clams
we saw on our neighbors' table; they came in the shell, cooked with
bits of sausage and black beans in a chili-oil sauce. For dessert, we
split three spires of springy coconut tofu.</p>
<p>We had no idea how much our eight little dishes would cost, but the bill
came to only $30. Then we wished we'd tried a few more.</p>
<p>Across the street at Chinatown Square, lined by fancifully sculpted
animals of the Chinese calendar, we walked past speakers blasting disco
music to browse among the mysterious bins of a Chinese grocery: dried
lily bulbs, dried fish maw, preserved mulberry.</p>
<p>On Wentworth, we passed under the Chinatown Gate and onto a busy
shopping avenue, mixing with tourists of many nationalities,
Chinese-American teenagers sipping bubble tea and uniformed
schoolchildren outside the Pui Tak Christian School.</p>
<p>Pagoda towers rose above the Pui Tak Center at the corner of Confucius
Place and Honorary Dr. Sun Yat Sen Way; adorned with art-nouveau tiles
and bas-relief lotus blossoms, it was built in the 1920s by the
neighborhood's principal tong society.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Shop windows displayed jade elephants, carved Buddhas and bamboo plants
coaxed into curlicues. Bakery cases were full of fruit tarts and
strawberry tortes, as well as the less-familiar bean- and lotus-paste
cakes, but we had no room left.</p>
<p>We'd meant to go on to Ukrainian Village for dinner, but the thought of
kielbasa and pierogis made us groan.</p>
<p>Instead, we retreated to the lounge of Shaw's Crab House, where Grace
managed to down a few oysters as we listened to live music.</p>
<p>In summer, Chicago's calendar is crammed with an amazing array of free
concerts, dances, fairs and festivals that pay tribute to the many
nationalities who have enriched the city.</p>
<p>Their contributions can be seen and heard any day of the year, however,
in the wail of a blues saxophone or twang of a fiddle, and on the menu
of every restaurant in town.</p>
<p>The neighborhoods are a fun destination, but their influences can be
felt everywhere.</p>
