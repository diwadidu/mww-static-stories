<p>Chicago is like one big theme park. The thing is, you have to bring your
own theme.</p>
<p>I have one every time I go there: Blues and bicycling. Museums and dim
sum. Skyscrapers and food tours.</p>
<p>That's because the possibilities are endless. There's so much to do in
Chicago that it's easy to bounce around like a kid in a candy store,
overwhelmed by choices, as time runs out.</p>
<p>So I always zero in on what I can't do at home. How about seeing a
Caribbean reef at Shedd Aquarium and Dalis at the Art Institute? Or
cruising through an urban landscape shaped by the man who said, &quot;Make
no little plans&quot;?</p>
<p>There's certainly nothing little about Chicago. It's big, swaggering,
a bit uncouth by reputation — the most American of cities, some say</p>
<ul>
<li>but also friendly and generous to visitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Planning a trip can be daunting. As Mark Twain wrote, &quot;It is hopeless
for the occasional visitor to try to keep up with Chicago . . . She is
always a novelty, for she is never the Chicago you saw when you passed
through the last time.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Here's a head start on finding the Chicago you want.</p>
<h3>Bicyclists and skaters</h3>
<p>Chicago's lakefront is an incredible treasure. Thanks to
department-store magnate Montgomery Ward, who spent a good part of his
fortune blocking commercial projects, it's parkland — except for the
34 acres of McCormick Place convention center, now called &quot;Mistake on
the Lake.&quot;</p>
<p>Along this stretch are countless views and 31 beaches, including Oak
Street Beach, at the end of the Magnificent Mile, and Ohio Street Beach,
on the north side of Navy Pier.</p>
<p>Bicycling is superb on the 18-mile Lakefront Trail, and bikes and
in-line skates can be rented at Millennium Park, Navy Pier and North
Avenue Beach.</p>
<p>North of downtown, the trail follows Lincoln Park along six miles of
Lake Michigan shoreline, with five beaches, trails, fields and a rock
garden and bird sanctuary — plus the zoo, of course.</p>
<p>South of the Loop, it passes the museum campus on its way to Promontory
Point, the Museum of Science and Industry and Jackson Park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_kids_rolling.jpg" alt="Kids roll down grass in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Kids roll down a hill near Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Using <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/">Divvy</a>, Chicago's bike-sharing
system, allows you to pick up and drop off bikes all around the city, at
attractions, beaches and CTA stations.</p>
<p>Divvy bikes also are perfect for exploring the elevated, three-mile <a href="http://www.the606.org/visit/map/">606
Trail</a> through the Logan Square/Wicker
Park neighborhood.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-Chicago-Lakefront-Trail/">Chicago by
bicycle</a>.</p>
<h3>Fun for kids</h3>
<p>This town is one big field trip for children. Museums - the fabulous
Science and Industry and Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium and the
Field, home of Sue, the world's largest Tyrannosaurus - are an
obvious choice.</p>
<p>Each one has free days, many in winter and some for Illinois residents.</p>
<p>In Grant Park, <a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks/maggie-daley-park/">Maggie Daley
Park</a>
includes climbing walls, play structures, an &quot;enchanted forest&quot; and
a twisting, 20-foot-wide loop that's used for roller-skating in summer
and ice-skating in winter.</p>
<p>To the north, the <a href="http://www.lpzoo.org/">Lincoln Park Zoo</a> is free and
lots of fun, with giraffes, hippos, gorillas and room for kids to run.
Seven blocks to the west, Oz Park has a wooden-castle playground and
comely statues of Dorothy, Toto and crew.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's free to sightsee at <a href="http://www.navypier.com">Navy Pier</a> and watch
the pirate shows, marching bands and Wednesday and Saturday fireworks.
But unwary parents can end up spending plenty on the rides, not to
mention souvenirs and snacks.</p>
<p>There are lots of restaurants kids will love, and we're not talking
Rock 'n' Roll McDonalds. Try
<a href="http://www.foodlifechicago.com/">foodlife</a> on the mezzanine of the John
Hancock Center, an atmospheric courtyard where chefs in 13 kiosks stand
ready to whip up everything from potstickers to pasta and fajitas to
fried chicken.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/chicago-with-kids/">Chicago with
kids</a>.</p>
<h3>Art lovers</h3>
<p>Walking through the <a href="http://www.artic.edu/aic/">Art Institute of
Chicago</a> is like paging through the syllabus
of Art Appreciation 101 — it's filled with world-famous works most
people see only in slides or books.</p>
<p>Look, there's &quot;American Gothic&quot;! There's Seurat's &quot;Sunday
Afternoon on the Island of the Grande Jatte&quot;! If your jaw doesn't
drop at least once, you don't like art. But if you do, it's a
don't-miss experience.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_fireboat.jpg" alt="A fireboat on the Chicago River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
One of Chicago fireboats patrols just west of the Michigan Avenue
bridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the Gold Coast, the <a href="http://www.mcachicago.org/">Museum of Contemporary
Art</a> is more avant-garde and hosts many
performances and programs, some for children.</p>
<p>Check for free days. Some museums always are free, such as the Smith
Museum of Stained Glass Windows, which lines an 800-foot-long series of
galleries in Navy Pier's Festival Hall.</p>
<p>Sculptures can be found throughout the city, especially in Millennium
Park, in the Loop, on Navy Pier's promenade and in Grant Park.</p>
<h3>Music lovers</h3>
<p>Every kind of music can be heard in this polyglot city. Witness the
various free summer festivals - blues in June, Taste of Chicago in
July, jazz over Labor Day and world music in September.</p>
<p>In Millennium Park, there's free music every day in summer, including
the free classical concerts held most nights at the Jay Pritzker
Pavilion, part of the two-month <a href="http://www.grantparkmusicfestival.com/">Grant Park Music
Festival</a>.</p>
<p>There are also free concerts at Navy Pier and Daley Plaza.</p>
<p>The Chicago Cultural Center, a Beaux Arts palace at Michigan and
Randolph, holds free noon concerts nearly every day year-round: jazz,
blues and folk at the ornate Randolph Café, and classical and choral
upstairs in Preston Bradley Hall, under the world's largest Tiffany
dome.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_oak_street_beach2.jpg" alt="Chicago's Oak Street Beach." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Not far from Chicago's Magnificent Mile, Oak Street Beach draws crowds.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the northern suburb of Highland Park, easily reached by Metra Rail,
the outdoor <a href="http://www.ravinia.org">Ravinia Festival</a> lasts all summer,
featuring classical, pop, country and every other kind of music.</p>
<p>For the latest on concerts and nightlife, stop by the city's two
tourism offices, at the Cultural Center and the Chicago Water Works, on
Michigan and Pearson, as soon as you hit town.</p>
<h3>Foodies and gourmets</h3>
<p>It may seem strange to some, but the former &quot;hog butcher to the
world&quot; is a major foodie capital.</p>
<p>Two dozen restaurants have Michelin stars and prices to match.</p>
<p>But the lowly tourist as well as low-wage locals can find plenty of
great but inexpensive food in ethnic markets, patisseries, bistros and
delis. One of the best ways to hit half a dozen in one afternoon is by
taking a guided food tour.</p>
<p>There are many, including some that focus just on pizza, but we like the
Chicago Food Planet tours. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/chicago-restaurant-food-tours/">Into the belly of
Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>For one-stop shopping, go to the <a href="http://www.frenchmarketchicago.com/">French
Market</a>, just west of the Chicago
River between Randolph and Washington, where 30 vendors sell artisan
cheese, breads, meats, pastries and chocolate.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_bicycling_skyline.jpg" alt="Bicycling in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>And if you want to try lots of courses at lots of restaurants, visit
during <a href="http://www.choosechicago.com/things-to-do/dining/chicago-restaurant-week/">Restaurant
Week</a>
in February.</p>
<h3>Fun on the water</h3>
<p>Sometimes, people forget that Chicago is virtually a beach town, with 31
miles of sand along Lake Michigan. You can swim and kayak there, and you
can take cruises on yachts, schooners and water taxis.</p>
<p>The four-masted schooner <a href="http://www.tallshipwindy.com/">Windy</a> is
moored at Navy Pier and gives theme cruises.</p>
<p>The newly cleaned-up Chicago River also is a tourist destination, with
narrated boat cruises taking tourists past skyscrapers and landmarks.
The Chicago Architecture Foundation's 90-minute cruises from the
Michigan Avenue bridge are especially popular; reserve early for summer
weekends.</p>
<p>Water taxis ply the river and the lakefront between Navy Pier and the
Museum Campus, and several companies rent kayaks.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/canoeing-chicago-river/">Paddling the Chicago
River</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_wrigley_field.jpg" alt="Wrigley Field in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Wrigley Field is the beloved home of the Cubs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Sports fans</h3>
<p>Chicago has not one, but two outdoor stadiums, both easily reached from
downtown.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=chc">Cubs</a> play at
beloved Wrigley Field, where the upper decks have a view of the lake
(take the Red Line train north to Addison), and the <a href="http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=cws">White
Sox</a> play in
concrete Comiskey Park (take the Red Line south to Sox-35th).</p>
<p>Wrigley Field is just a mile west of the tennis courts and marina of
Lincoln Park. The nine-hole <a href="http://www.cpdgolf.com/Sydney-R-Marovitz-Golf-Course.html">Sydney Marovitz golf
course</a>, a
3,290-yard, par-36 course also known as Waveland, is there, too, with
water hazards that include Lake Michigan.</p>
<h3>Architecture fans</h3>
<p>In Chicago, the buildings have as much personality as the people, and
architecture fans from all over the world come to see them.</p>
<p>The city had a golden opportunity to remake itself when the city burned
during the Great Fire of 1871, and it became the blank slate on which
American architectural aesthetics evolved.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_river_musicians.jpg" alt="Musicians play a festival in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Musicians perform at a free festival in the Loop.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was a world showplace of architecture during the 1893 Columbian
Exposition. But it's best known for the glass-box skyscrapers that
sprouted after World War II, especially those of Ludwig Mies van der
Rohe, who coined the now-famous truisms &quot;Less is more&quot; and &quot;God is
in the details.&quot;</p>
<p>The best way to learn more about Chicago's iconic buildings is by going
on one of the Chicago Architecture Foundation's walking tours. It also
offers tours by motorcoach, bicycle and boat.</p>
<p>In Oak Park, where Frank Lloyd Wright lived and worked, fans can tour
his home and studio and see many of the buildings he designed. Wright's
<a href="http://www.flwright.org/visit/robiehouse">Robie House</a> in Hyde Park
also is open for tours.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/chicago-architecture/">Skyscraper
city</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/wright-oak-park-chicago/">Wright in
Oak Park</a>.</p>
<h3>Ethnic neighborhoods</h3>
<p>If you've done the Loop, the lakefront and the Magnificent Mile, get
yourself a transit pass and go exploring.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chinatown_ping_tom.jpg" alt="Ping Tom Memorial Park in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Chinatown, Ping Tom Park is on the Chicago River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Chicago has lots of interesting ethnic neighborhoods: Chinatown, the
Swedish enclave of Andersonville, the East Indian zone on Devon Avenue,
Ukrainian Village, Bronzeville.</p>
<p>They're easily explored on your own — mainly, you'll want to eat,
with a few breaks for shopping — but if you're interested in history
and would like expert narration, the Chicago Architecture Foundation
offers tours of some neighborhoods, and Chicago Food Planet offers a
great food tour of Chinatown.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Planning a trip to Chicago</h3>
<p>For ways to save money, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/cheap-chicago/">Cheap
Chicago</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/chicago-free-cheap/">Pinching
pennies in Chicago</a>.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : In summer, I like to go on Memorial Day and Labor Day
weekends, when there are few conventions and the city is relatively
quiet.</p>
<p>There's a big festival nearly every weekend. Check <a href="https://www.choosechicago.com/events-and-shows/festivals-guide/">this month-by-month
list</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong>Before booking fares to Chicago, first check its <a href="http://www.choosechicago.com/meeting-professionals/convention-calendar/">convention
calendar</a></strong>
to see if a huge convention or event is in town; if so, rooms will be
hard to find and very expensive.</p>
<p>You'll find good rates in late fall, in the two weeks before Christmas
and in winter. For more, see <a href="./fast-plans/fast-plans-chicago-christmas.html/">Christmas in
Chicago</a>.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : You'll be closest to the action in the River North
and Loop areas closest to Michigan Avenue. But in the summer, it's also
nice to stay in the Lincoln Park neighborhood, close to the lakeshore.</p>
<p>For suggestions, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/hotels-motels/best-hotels-chicago/">Where to stay in
Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>No matter where you stay, it's easy to get around via <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com/travel_information/maps/default.aspx">Transit
Chicago</a>
trains or buses.</p>
<p><em>Dining</em> : It's hard to go wrong. For restaurant recommendations and
foodie lists, check <a href="http://www.yelp.com/chicago">Chicago Yelp</a>,
<a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/boards/7">Chowhound</a> and the listings of
<a href="http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Dining/">Chicago magazine</a>.</p>
<p>And don't neglect the neighborhoods. Some of the best eating is in Old
Town and Lincoln Park, just north of downtown.</p>
<p><em>Tourism information</em> : <a href="http://www.choosechicago.com/">Choose Chicago</a>, 877-244-2246. I like to visit the visitor center in the Chicago
Cultural Center at Randolph and Michigan shortly after I arrive to see
what's going on.</p>
