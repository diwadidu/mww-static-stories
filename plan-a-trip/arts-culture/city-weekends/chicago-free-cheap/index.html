<h2>It's easy to save money in this lively town ... and to spend it, too.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_wrigley_field.jpg" alt="Wrigley Field in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
If you look for tickets after a game already has started, you might get
a deal.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you love to visit Chicago, as we do, you have a compelling reason to
look for discounts when you're visiting — the more you save, the
sooner you can return.</p>
<p>We traveled there one Memorial Day weekend, but we started looking for
savings months in advance. First, I arranged a home exchange, so we
didn't have to pay for a hotel.</p>
<p>Then we signed up for local deal listings. Then we started looking for
free things to do.</p>
<p>Here's how we did. (If you want to go straight to the tips, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/cheap-chicago/">Cheap
Chicago</a>.)</p>
<h3>The free</h3>
<p>We saved the most money by using
<a href="http://www.homeexchange.com">HomeExchange.com</a> to find a condo in
Lincoln Park, just north of downtown and three blocks from Lake
Michigan. We saved not only on the hotel rate, but the hotel tax — a
stiff 16.4 percent downtown.</p>
<p>The first thing we did was take a walking tour up Clark Street, as
recommended on the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/chicago">Chicago Yelp forums</a>.
As we approached Wrigley Field, we noticed a hubbub and wondered if
there was a <a href="http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com">Cubs</a> game that afternoon.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then a storefront ticket seller waved us over and, after we said we
didn't care much about the game but would like to see the venue, just
gave us the tickets.</p>
<p>It was the bottom of the second when we went in to watch a few innings
against the Pirates. The game was boring, but the stadium, with its
ivy-covered outfield and bleachers atop neighboring buildings, was
charming.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't won the World Series for what, 103 years, but it's always
packed no matter what,&quot; said longtime fan Jerry Cunningham, who was
seated next to me. &quot;They say maybe that's why we don't win — we
don't care.&quot;</p>
<p>Jerry and his friend Bill had paid $25 apiece for their seats. Lesson:
Wait till the game has started to buy tickets; if it's a weekday game,
you might get a deal.</p>
<p>Farther along Clark Street, we picked up a free guide to tour <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/halloween/graceland-cemetery-tours/">Graceland
Cemetery</a>, &quot;the
final resting place of people who have writ the story of Chicago, large
and small.&quot;</p>
<p>The gorgeous, parklike cemetery is best-known for its splendid
mausoleums, some designed by Louis Sullivan, who is buried at Graceland.
Fellow architect Daniel Burnham (&quot;Make no small plans&quot;) is there,
too, on his own island in the lake.</p>
<p>But first, we were stopped in our tracks by a spooky Lorado Taft statue
named &quot;Eternal Silence.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_giraffes.jpg" alt="Lincoln Park Zoo in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Lincoln Park Zoo is fabulous and free.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;People get all tripped out by it,&quot; said a maintenance man named
Ron. &quot;They say if you take a photo you can't see its face, that it's
blurred. But I just laugh, because it's right on the cover of the book
'Haunted Chicago.' &quot;</p>
<p>We ended our walk in Andersonville, the old Swedish neighborhood, where
we bellied up to the bar at craft-beer mecca
<a href="http://hopleaf.com/">Hopleaf</a>. I bought two beers and got four free
samples — a nice ratio, I thought.</p>
<p>Another afternoon, we used our hosts' membership pass to get into the
Art Institute of Chicago, saving $46. It does offer occasional <a href="http://www.choosechicago.com/articles/view/FREE-MUSEUM-DAYS-IN-CHICAGO/556/">free
days</a>, along with the city's other big museums.</p>
<p>The weather had cleared by the end of the day, so we went to a free
wind-ensemble concert at Pritzker Pavilion in <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/millennium_park.html">Millennium
Park</a>. In summer, there's something free and fun every day in the park —
concerts, family activities, tours, even workouts.</p>
<p>On our last day, after our three-day CTA pass had expired, we used our
hosts' bicycles to ride to Old Town and Navy Pier and back, saving $60
on two half-day rentals. (Chicago now has a <a href="http://www.divvybikes.com/">Divvy
bike-sharing</a> system.)</p>
<p>Probably the city's best deal is the <a href="http://www.lpzoo.org/">Lincoln Park
Zoo</a>, one of only two free zoos in the nation.
It's no cheapo zoo, either; round a corner, and you'll see a
rhinoceros glaring at you, or giraffes grazing on trees, or gorillas
swinging on ropes.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The zoo includes a farmyard, where children can feed cows and pet goats
and ponies, and a nature boardwalk. The Garfield Park Conservatory is
free, too.</p>
<p>And the wide sand beaches that border Lincoln Park? Free, and a favorite
destination for Chicagoans on warm days.</p>
<h3>The discounted</h3>
<p>Ah, <a href="https://www.groupon.com/browse/chicago">Groupon</a>. . . we love it,
and we hate it.</p>
<p>We arrived with four of them. I bought two $20 vouchers for my
husband's favorite tea shop, Tea Gschwendner on the Gold Coast, so he
could buy an oolong that costs $51 for 100 grams. Unfortunately, we
were allowed to  use only one coupon for it, so we ended up spending an
extra $34.</p>
<p>I bought a $30 Groupon for a pizzeria after we plugged our hosts'
address into <a href="https://www.redfin.com/how-walk-score-works">Walk Score</a>
to see what restaurants were nearby, then checked reviews.</p>
<p>I must have made a mistake, because it wasn't that close. But it was a
nice meal, and when our bill for salad, pizza and drinks came to
$30.73, our ultra-friendly waitress threw in the 73 cents, then gave us
a 25 percent off card for future meals.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_windy_onboard.jpg" alt="The schooner Windy in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
With a Groupon, we got a half-price cruise on the tall ship Windy.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We weren't so lucky at Delightful Pastries in Old Town, which took the
$20 Groupon grudgingly and wouldn't let us eat our food at one of their
tables. They also forgot our orange juices, so we had to go back.</p>
<p>Our last Groupon was for a Lake Michigan cruise on the four-masted
schooner <a href="https://tallshipwindy.com/">Windy</a>. It was walk-up only, and
we were afraid the cruise would be sold out, but there were plenty of
tickets . . . and it was a highlight of the weekend.</p>
<p>Total coupon savings: $75. It was worth the hassle . . . I think.</p>
<p>We also used a promo code from the tourist office to get $10 off two
tickets to a Sunday comedy show at Second City in Old Town.</p>
<p>It helped defray the $12 handling fee, which you have to pay to reserve
online . . . and you have to reserve, because all of the weekend shows
sell out in advance.</p>
<h3>. . . and the splurges</h3>
<p>We have to admit that, when we're not acting like Scrooge, we sometimes
act like the Queen of Sheba. We spent a big chunk of our savings on good
meals, including a $100 three-course birthday brunch at North Pond
Restaurant, an exquisitely restored Arts and Crafts warming house on a
lake in Lincoln Park.</p>
<p>Second City wasn't cheap; tickets are $22-$27. And we flew, though if
we'd had the time and inclination, we could have taken the
<a href="http://us.megabus.com/routemap.aspx">Megabus</a> for as little as $1
apiece.</p>
<p>Still, we saved about as much as we spent. That gives us a batting
average of .5 — which is better than you'll usually see at Wrigley
Field, no matter how much you pay for a ticket.</p>
