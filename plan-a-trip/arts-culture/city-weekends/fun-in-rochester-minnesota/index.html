<p>In Rochester, a tourist from the Twin Cities is a novelty.</p>
<p>Tourists from anywhere are a novelty, though patients and medical
professionals come from around the world.</p>
<p>&quot;This week, I had customers from Guatemala, Panama and India in just a
few hours,&quot; said Kathy Barnes, a fourth-grade teacher working part-time
at the apparel shop Collections.</p>
<p>&quot;People from all over were coming to Mayo for a study on chewing
tobacco. That's why I always ask people where they're from — you
hear the greatest stories.&quot;</p>
<p>The Mayo Clinic is interesting; we've all heard about the sheiks and
kings who get treated there. But Rochester?</p>
<p>It's the third-largest city in Minnesota, after Minneapolis and St.
Paul, and still growing.</p>
<p>Yet it barely has a downtown. Its big festival, Rochesterfest, is little
known outside the area. It doesn't have much street life. It didn't
have a four-year university until 2007.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Some Twin Cities tourists consider Rochester the gateway to Lanesboro,
pop. 767. In 2006, the city decided to change that, introducing a new
slogan: &quot;Rah Rah Rochester: More Than You Know.&quot;</p>
<p>It didn't say what.</p>
<p>There's Mayo, of course. Rochester would have been just another small
town if the U.S. Army hadn't assigned Dr. William Worrall Mayo to
Rochester in 1863; his wife was tired of moving around, so they stayed.</p>
<p>In 1883, after two destructive tornadoes, a Franciscan nun persuaded
Mayo to be medical director of a new hospital; in 1892, he and his two
physician sons invited other doctors with specialties to become their
partners.</p>
<p>It was one of the first group practices, and it blossomed into the Mayo
Clinic, which now occupies 40 buildings and employs more than 26,000
people in a city of 115,000.</p>
<p>IBM has a big plant in Rochester, too. With its 4,500 employees and
those of other high-tech industries, you can assume there are a lot of
smart people around.</p>
<p>Rochester often ranks highly on &quot;Best places to live&quot; lists. But is
it a good place to visit?</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/rochester_antiques.jpg" alt="Shopping for antiques in Rochester." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Well, it's a little buttoned-down. But yes, it can be a lot of fun.</p>
<p>We spent a weekend there one November and started with a holiday tour of
Mayowood, the country manor built by W.W. Mayo's younger son, Dr.
Charlie, and later inhabited by Dr. Charlie's son Dr. Chuck, who raised
Young Dr. Charlie and his five other children there.</p>
<p>Built at the same time as Duluth's Glensheen, the 38-room house is the
same size but much less ornate. It was a retreat for Dr. Charlie, who
loved nature. He built water gardens, stocked ponds with fish and
brought in elk, Japanese deer and English pheasants.</p>
<p>He also built greenhouses and, being frugal, used old glass X-ray plates
for the panels: &quot;For years, one could walk through the greenhouses and
see the outlines of a stomach here, a gallbladder there, a fractured
tibia over the petunias,&quot; Dr. Chuck recalled later.</p>
<p>Over the years, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Helen Keller and the king of
Nepal were among those who visited Mayowood. In 1965, when Dr. Chuck's
children were grown, he and his wife, Alice, donated the house and 10
acres to the Olmsted County Historical Society.</p>
<p>Most of the contents remain, including childhood portraits of Dr.
Chuck's six children.</p>
<p>They had an artistic streak: Young Dr. Charlie became an expert in
Scandinavian birch-bark weaving and helped found the North House Folk
School in Grand Marais.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>After exploring the wooded grounds, we drove back to town on U.S. 52,
exiting on Second Street.</p>
<p>It was a medical alley, lined with Mayo's St. Marys Hospital campus,
motels for patients, a Ronald McDonald House and houses for the
Transplant Foundation and the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation.</p>
<p>Then we were in Mayo's downtown campus, including the modern,
wavy-glass Gonda Building and the 1928 Plummer Building, oldest and once
tallest, with a beacon for airplanes in its four-story bell tower.</p>
<p>The downtown is mostly Mayo, remarkable for its dearth of storefronts.
We came to the Mayo Civic Center and the new Rochester Art Center, and
around the corner found Historic Third Street, which did have shops,
bistros and wine bars.</p>
<p>At the Antique Mall on Third, I found a 95-year-old postcard of
Minnehaha Falls.</p>
<p>At John Kruesel's General Merchandise, I found a whole case of
souvenirs from Imperial Russia, including a 1913 lunch pail celebrating
the tercentenary of the Romanov dynasty and an 1896 &quot;blood cup&quot; from
the coronation of Nicholas II, where more than 1,000 people were crushed
to death in a stampede.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/rochester_mayowood.jpg" alt="Mayowood mansion in Rochester." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Three generations of Mayos lived in Mayowood, a 1911 country manor now
open for tours.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Proprietor Kruesel has put quotations onto the facade of his store that
reflect his views.  One is by Dr. Charlie Mayo — &quot;The greatest
contribution we can make is to prepare the oncoming generations to think
for themselves&quot; — and one is by Mayo's brother, Dr. Will: &quot;This
country rightfully has based its idea of a safe democracy on
education.&quot;</p>
<p>We had a lot of choices for dinner — contrary to common wisdom,
Rochester does have interesting restaurants and breweries, too.</p>
<p>It also has nightlife. At the Mayo Civic Center, the popular Louisiana
Cajun band Beausoleil was playing.</p>
<p>Ticket-takers handed out strands of Mardi Gras beads at the door, and as
soon as the band launched into its fast, blues-laced Cajun and zydeco
songs, the crowd filled  the auditorium's dance floor.</p>
<p>Only a few people knew the Cajun two-step, but older folks did the polka
and a cluster of young people bounced up and down, waved their hands and
formed a conga line.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this a rowdy Minnesota town?&quot; teased band leader Michael Doucet.
&quot;This has never happened before. Is this a normal crowd? This is a part
of Minnesota we haven't been in yet. We love it.&quot;</p>
<p>On Sunday, we explored downtown Rochester. At the Kahler Complex, a man
was pacing back and forth past shops, speaking loud Arabic into a cell
phone; the Kahler hotels have long catered to Mideast royal families at
its hotels, &quot;Where the Wealthy Get Healthy.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The Kahler always has been tied to the Mayo Clinic. The first Kahler in
1907 catered to convalescents and had a hospital unit, and the new
Kahler, opened in 1921, operated as part hospital, part hotel until
1954.</p>
<p>Now, the Kahler Complex sticks to hotel guests, offering a spa,
boutiques, coffee shops, antiques galleries and a restaurant,  all under
one roof.</p>
<p>Skyways and &quot;subways&quot; link it to clinic buildings and to the Shops
at University Square, another indoor shopping complex.</p>
<p>There are lots of nice things there — handmade shoes, Norwegian
sweaters, Austrian boiled-wool jackets. And nearby on Peace Plaza is the
SEMVA Gallery, a co-op that shows pieces from 70 local artists.</p>
<p>The most impressive building on Peace Plaza, however, is the 1927
Historic Chateau Theatre, it has a lighted marquee, a vaulted
midnight-blue ceiling and walls lined with medieval-style parapets,
turrets and balconies.</p>
<p>The only thing we missed was the free weekday art tour of the Mayo
Clinic. Then, as we were peering at a Dale Chihuly installation through
the locked doors of the Gonda Building, we lucked out.</p>
<p>The security guard let us inside to see the Chihuly, a golden froth of
glass bows and ribbons, then took us down marble stairs to see
Chihuly's &quot;Waterfall Blue Persian Set,&quot; donated by Mayo staff.</p>
<p>&quot;You'll see stuff like this in alcoves on every floor,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He showed us a display of White House china, a massive Rodin figure and
bronze sculptures from Tibet. Then he took us across the street and
through the ornate doors of the Plummer Building, designed by one of the
Mayos' original partners.</p>
<p>The interior was an eyeful, with decorative elevator grilles, iron
chandeliers and wood paneling, and the doors were museum-quality, with
inner gates topped by a row of 16 small bronze knights.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/rochester_quarry_kids.jpg" alt="Kids at Quarry Hill in Rochester." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the east side of town, Quarry Hill has trails and a nature center.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We had hoped to catch the bird-banding program at Quarry Hill Nature
Center, but the art tour was worth it.</p>
<p>Quarry Hill Park was crawling with families, hiking, biking and
exploring the nature center, where the naturalist lifted a rock to show
us a giant water bug, which glides up under frogs, injects a toxin and
liquifies their flesh.</p>
<p>There was a live timber rattlesnake, a kestrel with a half-eaten mouse
and a reproduction of Stan, the most complete Tyrannosaurus skull ever
found.</p>
<p>Our last stop was Silver Lake; if we'd had our bikes, we could have
ridden there from Quarry Hill, on part of the town's 60-mile network of
paved trails.</p>
<p>Rochester doesn't feel like other towns. But there's plenty to
explore. It has theater, art, dance and a symphony, like any other
decent-sized town, plus attractive parks and trails.</p>
<p>So go ahead and be wild — get off U.S. 52 for once and look around.
Rochester may surprise you.</p>
