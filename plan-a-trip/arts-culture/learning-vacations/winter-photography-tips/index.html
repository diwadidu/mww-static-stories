<h2>In photography workshops, learn how to translate snow and ice into stunning images.</h2>

<p>Nothing is more photogenic than winter.</p>
<p>You've got icicles dripping off cliffs, trees covered with hoarfrost
and pancake ice floating on harbors. But how do you capture all that?</p>
<p>As anyone who's tried winter photography knows, it's no snap.</p>
<p>The eye sees white snow sparkling on an undulating landscape. But in
your photograph, the hills are flat, shadows have appeared out of
nowhere and the snow is as gray as old underwear.</p>
<p>It could be time to take a photography workshop.</p>
<p>&quot;Interest in workshops is skyrocketing,&quot; says
photographer/instructor Bryan Hansel of Grand Marais, Minn. &quot;With a
digital camera, you can get a good-quality image fairly easily, so when
you come to a workshop, it's pretty much guaranteed you'll go home
with good images.&quot;</p>
<p>In winter, it's all about the light. Every instructor will make you get
up before dawn to catch the first rays of sunlight, which bathe all that
snow and ice in reflected color.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Winter is my favorite time to shoot,&quot; Hansel says. &quot;It's always
brighter and more vibrant, with better color.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a quality of light you don't see any other time of year,&quot;
says John Gregor of ColdSnap Photography in Two Harbors, Minn. &quot;In
winter, it bounces around more.&quot;</p>
<p>Gregor and nature photographer Randy Hagar teach weekend workshops
year-round, and one year, I signed up for &quot;Winter Splendor: A
Photographic Retreat&quot; at a retreat center in the St. Croix River
Valley.</p>
<p>The first thing our instructors did was tell us not to worry about
having fancy equipment, because we already had what we needed to take
good photos.</p>
<p>&quot;All this technical stuff is just a means to an end,&quot; Gregor said.
&quot;Your objective is to see the world in a different way, a complex way.
You can't just go out and say, 'I'm going to get this picture.' You have
to let the preconceptions go, be in the moment so you can see the images
and capture those.&quot;</p>
<p>After a discussion of techniques - to counteract the camera's tendency
to see snow as gray, he said, open the lens aperture an extra two stops</p>
<ul>
<li>we went hunting.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_harbors_edna_gregor.jpg" alt="Ice and the Edna G. in Two Harbors." /><p class="copyright">&copy; John Gregor</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Two Harbors, John Gregor shot the historic Edna G. tugboat amid ice
on Agate Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Some of us walked down to the snowy surface of a lake, shooting stumps
and footprints and an old fishing boat. Some of us prowled around
buildings, trying to find art in the snow-topped curves of patio
furniture.</p>
<p>Hagar used a macro lens to shoot a bit of red fungus on a wood bench,
creating a beautiful image that had the rest of us sighing with envy.</p>
<p>The next day, we got up before dawn and set up our tripods near an old
farmstead, waiting. A band of pink as rosy as raspberry sherbet appeared
on the horizon, and we shot away at a field filled with hay bales.</p>
<p>My fingers were freezing, and I was walking away when I glimpsed a
photogenic cluster of seed pods in a halo of pink. But as I was focusing
my zoom lens, the rosy light faded into gray.</p>
<p>In photography, timing is everything.</p>
<p>After lunch, Gregor reviewed our photos. Most of us had compositions
ruined by shadows from the harsh sun.</p>
<p>As we'd focused on our main subjects, they'd escaped our notice. So had
the warning on page 16 of the course manual:</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;EVERYTHING THAT IS IN THE VIEWFINDER AT THE MOMENT THE IMAGE IS MADE
WILL BE RECORDED ON THE FILM.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What you see is not what you get,&quot; Hagar noted.</p>
<p>After 48 hours in the near-constant company of professionals, we'd
learned about filters and gray cards, bracketing and the rule of thirds.
We'd learned how to see what was in our viewfinder.</p>
<p>We knew we still would make many mistakes. But, as Gregor had told us,
we also knew we had what it takes - at least, some of the time.</p>
<h3>A few winter-photography tips</h3>
<p>On a really cold day, keep your camera inside your jacket, next to your
skin. It prolongs battery life and possibly your camera (once my shutter
froze — permanently — in a minus 70-degree windchill on Minnesota's
North Shore).</p>
<p>To correct the camera's tendency to underexpose a large expanse of snow
and turn it gray, overexpose by opening the lens one to two stops.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_sunset_ridges.jpg" alt="Sunset on Grand Marais harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From Artists' Point in Grand Marais, photographers can shoot the harbor
light, the Sawtooth Mountains and Lake Superior waves.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For the best light, shoot at sunrise, when colors are most luminous, and
just before sunset, when the sun's rays skim across the landscape at a
low angle.</p>
<p>Try not to shoot at high noon on a sunny day, when shadows are bouncing
all over the place. If you have to shoot a high-contrast landscape,
frame it as tightly as possible. Or shoot wide, with a person in a
colorful jacket popping out amid an expanse of white, brown and gray.</p>
<p>Is the sky gray and washed out? Just try to keep it out of your shot.</p>
<p>Add interest to a monochromatic scene by lying on your back and shooting
up with a wide-angle lens.</p>
<p>In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=KgHoL0xFQTI">video from Duluth Public
TV</a>, shot on Artists Point in Grand Marais, Bryan Hansel offers tips that
