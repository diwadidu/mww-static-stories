<h2>In the woods of northern Minnesota, learners are immersed in world cultures.</h2>

<p>It had become a summer tradition: Drive my daughter up north to her
German camp at Concordia Language Villages, look enviously around the
fabulous campus and whine that adults should get to come, too.</p>
<p>Someone was listening. One day, a flier arrived at my house, announcing
the first French and German adult weeks. As it turns out, others had
whined, too.</p>
<p>&quot;We've got these millions and millions of dollars' worth of
facilities, and we want to use them,&quot; said Larry Saukko, dean of the
Finnish and academic-year German programs.</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, parents and grandparents would come on closing day and say,
'When are you going to quit wasting it on kids and start doing it for
us?' &quot;</p>
<p>On 800 acres of forest around Turtle River Lake, just north of the
Bemidji, a gabled French country chateau rises amid the pines and
aspen.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Down a winding drive and past an archway bidding &quot;<em>Herzlich
willkommen</em>,&quot; there's a big
half-timbered building, complete with oriel window, cupola and peaked
roof, plus a cluster of alpine chalets.</p>
<p>At another end of the lake, halls adorned with woodcarvings and
rosemaling sit near a miniature stabur and a stavkirke, the medieval
wooden church first built by Vikings.</p>
<p>Not far away, a red wooden hall with striking decorative details in
white and yellow is surrounded by the birches of the Finnish forest.</p>
<p>Cabins, too, sport the look of each country; some were imported from
Europe and reassembled on site. From the beginning, Saukko says,
Concordia College administrators decided, &quot;No, we're not going to
build cheap.&quot;</p>
<p>It was an elementary-education professor at the northwestern Minnesota
college who, in 1961, started a German-immersion camp based on his
observations of the speed at which children of U.S. servicemen in
Germany picked up the language.</p>

<p>A French camp followed in 1962, with Spanish and Norwegian camps
starting in 1963 and Russian in 1966.</p>
<p>The first permanent site on the Bemidji land was Skogfjorden, the
Norwegian village, begun in 1969 with help from Sons of Norway.</p>
<p>Other sites followed, along with more languages — Swedish, Finnish,
Danish, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Korean, Italian and Portuguese —
some taught at satellite resorts in the nearby lakes region.</p>
<p>For more than two decades, these weeklong camps were only for the kids.</p>
<p>I went to one of the first adult German camps, and like everyone else in
my group, I was familiar with basic German. But it didn't take long
before our brains hit overload.</p>
<p>&quot;In the last 24 hours, I should be feeling smarter, but I feel
dumber,&quot; lamented Donald &quot;Gerhard&quot; Preuss of Oklahoma City.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He got a pep talk from one of the other intermediate students, Priscilla
&quot;Petra&quot; Larson, of Jamestown, N.D.: &quot;I went to the French camp, and
it was like that there,&quot; she said. &quot;You start out all enthusiastic,
but by Thursday you start getting tired.&quot;</p>
<p>The week was full — two or three hours of daily language instruction,
lectures, choir practice, film, folk dancing, folk painting and card
games, mostly in German — and there was more to come.</p>
<p>After the grammar session that brought grief to poor Gerhard, we broke
for coffee and walnut cream cake, followed by a slide lecture about
Berlin, from Frederick the Great to Checkpoint Charlie.</p>
<p>Then I walked down to the beach along a leaf-covered path and returned
to hear Jill van Koolwijk, teacher of the advanced students, leading a
practice of Beethoven's &quot;Ode to Joy.&quot; Candles were being lit on
cloth-covered tables in the dining room for the banquet.</p>
<p>The food at Concordia is renowned, and I soon found out why.</p>
<p>First came a course of chicken broth with airy little dumplings, which
was followed by stuffed mushrooms; marinated tomato and onion salad;
dense dark bread with tender <em>Sauerbraten</em> and <em>Klopse</em>, dumpling-like potatoes; and, finally,
apple strudel.</p>

manor.

<p>The evening program was put on by each class, topped by a hilarious
performance of &quot;<em>Rottkäppchen</em>&quot; —
Red Riding Hood — that featured Ron Malcolm, a kinetic wrestling coach
who played the wolf and proved that Germans do have a sense of humor.</p>
<p>In fact, the next morning, watching a distinguished-looking pastor and
grandfather from Missouri sing along with a silly German pop song called
&quot;Gabi and Klaus,&quot; I was struck by what a great sport everyone was.</p>
<p>There may not have been any miracles worked in such a short time. But I,
for one, was surprised at how, after 10 years, my familiarity with those
beefy German nouns and slippery verbs bobbed back to the surface.</p>
<p>&quot;I would say one thing for sure,&quot; said van Koolwijk, a native of
Germany who now lives in St. Paul. &quot;Everybody's German came back.&quot;</p>
