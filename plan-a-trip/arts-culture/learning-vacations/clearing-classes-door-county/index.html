<h2>In a tranquil Door County forest, students gather to reflect and learn.</h2>

<p>In a cedar and pine forest on Lake Michigan, moments of illumination fly
around like sparks off a campfire.</p>
<p>The best way to capture sunrise on film. Handy techniques for depicting
shadow in watercolors. How to harness the power of the inner eye.</p>
<p>At the Clearing in Door County, everything becomes clearer.</p>
<p>In the 1920s and '30s, a Danish landscape architect from Chicago was
toiling around the Midwest, beautifying the estates of the Armours, the
Fords, the Florsheims.</p>
<p>But his thoughts were on a landscape to the north, where he had bought
blufftop land at the top of the Door Peninsula, with a view of Lake
Michigan's Green Bay and the setting sun.</p>
<p>Jens Jensen wanted to build a folk school in the Scandinavian tradition,
a place where ordinary people could escape the city to learn and relax
in a beautiful setting.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Every one is entitled to a home where the sun, the stars, open fields,
giant trees and smiling flowers are free to teach an undisturbed lesson
of Life,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>He was still hauling limestone for the school's buildings into his 80s,
and after he died, his work was carried on by his associate, Mertha
Fulkerson, and then by the Friends of the Clearing.</p>
<p>Today, more than a thousand people every year come to the Clearing to
polish skills and perceptions — in writing, music, natural sciences,
philosophy, wood carving, quilting, yoga, gardening.</p>
<p>They stay in cottages made from stone quarried from the land and sleep
under quilts stitched by students. They eat home-baked breads and walk
paths lined by Arts and Crafts lanterns designed by Clearing staff and
made by volunteers.</p>
<p>They paint, write and study in a sunlit 1938 schoolhouse wrapped by
stone buttresses and ivy.</p>
<p>In the stone lodge, they gather around a clerestory window with a view
of the bay and three white pines, under portraits of a white-haired
pixie who firmly believed in the power of nature to renew weary souls.</p>

<p>&quot;He guides a lot of our thoughts here,&quot; says director Mike Schneider.
&quot;Our standards are high because Jensen's standards were high; we're
just carrying them through.</p>
<p>&quot;It's funny, because he's been dead 50 years, but we find ourselves,
when building buildings or buying furniture, thinking, 'Would Jens
approve?' &quot;</p>
<p>Jensen's vision seemed particularly inspired on a week in mid-October,
when the Door Peninsula was aglow in autumn colors.</p>
<p>At the Clearing, aspen formed a golden canopy over the narrow drive
leading toward the campus, and scarlet ivy wound over white stone
buildings bathed in sun.</p>
<p>Watercolor painters and nature photographers converged on the Clearing
that week. I was among 13 people studying with Chicago-area photographer
Hank Erdmann, who was teaching &quot;The Art of Nature and Outdoor
Photography.&quot;</p>
<p>Eighteen students had signed up for Green Bay artist Bridget Austin's
extremely popular watercolor class, and all had snared their spots by
calling in the first hour after registration opened in February.</p>
<p>&quot;This is my 13th year in a row, mostly watercolor, and needless to say,
I look forward to it all year,&quot; said Chris Sommerfelt of Wauwatosa,
Wis., at the orientation.</p>
<p>Many of the students spoke reverently of Austin, a pleasant woman who
tosses off exquisite sketches with relaxed deftness. &quot;We have an
incredible teacher,&quot; said Ronna Rawlins of Beaver Dam, Wis. &quot;She tells
jokes while she's demonstrating, and she'll make a work of art.&quot;</p>
<p>As the painters worked away in the airy, sunlit schoolhouse, the
photographers struggled with f-stops, apertures, hyperfocal distance and
exposure control.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The camera, Erdmann explained, wants to move brights and darks toward
midtones. So to stop a field of blindingly white snow from becoming
gray, a photographer has to add light to the bright scene, knowing that
the camera is subtracting it.</p>
<p>To keep the detail in the dark bark of a tree, she has to take away
light, knowing that the camera is adding it.</p>
<p>For many students, it was an ah-ha! moment. We sat mutely, mulling it
over.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I've been doing the opposite,&quot; Teri Czarnecki of Slinger,
Wis., finally said.</p>
<p>&quot;That explains a lot,&quot; said Nita Herreman of Wilmette, Ill..</p>
<p>The more subtle demands of composition seemed easier to understand —
until we got back our slides, which Clearing staff had driven all the
way to Green Bay to have developed. Then we realized that what the
camera saw had been different from what our eyes saw.</p>
<p>The images we thought were going to be so beautiful had slanting
horizons, subjects that blended into backgrounds and fuzzy weeds poking
into our frames.</p>
<p>After that, we had a lot of questions.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/ellison_bay_headlands.jpg" alt="A rock beach on Ellison Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

beaches on Green Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>First, Erdmann told us, we have to train ourselves to actually see
what's in our viewfinder. Then, we have to make the camera — a blank
slate — interpret what our eyes see.</p>
<p>&quot;The eye sees a lot more than a camera, because the eye is connected to
a brain,&quot; Erdmann said. &quot;If I can get you to do anything this week it's
to see differently, to see objectively; then I've done my job.&quot;</p>
<p>Erdmann even went beyond the call of duty, heaping us with illustrated
booklets he'd made himself, taking us on field trips every day and
giving one slide lecture after another.</p>
<p>&quot;I told Hank I think I've regressed,&quot; joked Hermi Krueger of Appleton,
Wis. &quot;I'm so overloaded with information I don't know anything.&quot;</p>
<p>But our hard work was punctuated by superb meals, served at trestle
tables in the lodge. As we sat at dinner one day, gazing at the dessert
set before us — freshly baked cherry cobbler with vanilla ice cream
— Herreman sighed and said, &quot;Life is going to be hard next week.&quot;</p>
<p>As Jens Jensen knew, life in the city and suburbs is different from life
on the Door Peninsula. The Door is lovelier — and, north of the busy
tourist towns of Fish Creek, Ephraim and Sister Bay, much more serene.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On our sunrise excursions to Europe Bay beach and Cave Point County
Park, and field trips to Toft Point Natural Area and into the
countryside, we marveled at our luck in being there.</p>
<p>And sprawled on cliffs and in fields, zeroing in on our photo subjects
— a picturesque milkweed pod, a patch of herb rocket, a puddle turned
pink by the rising sun — we probably were as &quot;close to the soil&quot; as
Jensen had wanted us to be.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, everyone assembled for songs, skits and a show
of paintings and photos.</p>
<p>Amid their joking and laughing, the painters had compiled an amazing
oeuvre. Judy Larson of Greendale, Wis., had finished eight pieces,
including a red barn with a foreground of wildflowers that, I told her,
looked exactly like a scene my class would have loved to shoot.</p>
<p>&quot;We're like photographers, we're always looking,&quot; Larson said. &quot;This
tree, that stump — there's so much to look for.&quot;</p>
<p>I know I'll think of Erdmann and the class whenever I &quot;garden&quot; for a
close-up — that is, brush aside stray vegetation that would have
cluttered the edge of my frame.</p>

<p>Perhaps, as he hoped, I've learned to see. Over breakfast on the last
day, Nita Herreman said that's what she hopes, too.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to break out of the box,&quot; she said. &quot;I needed new
perspectives. And I think I got that.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: The Clearing</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : Ellison Bay is in the northern Door, about an hour and
a half from Green Bay.</p>
<p><em>Classes</em> : The May-October season includes dozens of classes on nature,
writing, music, philosophy and arts.</p>
<p><em>Registration</em> : In December, the Clearing puts out a flier that lists
class titles, dates and fees. The catalog comes out late January or
early February, and registration is held in mid-February.</p>
<p>Students can register online and by phone, mail and fax. Some of the
classes — watercolor painting, oil painting and quilting in particular
— fill in the first hour.</p>
