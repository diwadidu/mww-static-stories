<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/north_house_boat.jpg" alt="Building a boat in Grand Marais." /><p class="copyright">&copy; North House Folk School</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Grand Marais, the North House Folk School offers many classes on
boat-building.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In this part of the country, the do-it-yourself movement is alive and
well.</p>
<p>Folk schools in Minnesota are thriving, with dozens of workshops
offered. In canoe country, you can learn winter photography one weekend
at the Ely Folk School, and animal tracking the next.</p>
<p>In bluff country near Lanesboro, take a class at the Eagle Bluff Skills
School on cheese-making or Amish bread-baking.</p>
<p>At the Driftless Folk School in the coulees of Wisconsin, learn how to
make rag rugs from old T-shirts and baskets from pine needles.</p>
<p>It's a two-fer: Acquire a life skill <em>and</em> enjoy a fun getaway in a
beautiful place.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the folk schools are in vacation areas, though not all
operate year-round.</p>
<p>One that does is the North House Folk School in Grand Marais, at the
northeast tip of Minnesota. Even in the depths of winter, many of its
classes fill quickly.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Learning the old ways</h3>
<p>Often, students are regulars, like retiree Albert Knutson of
Minneapolis. The first class he took at North House was on making
moosehide mukluks.</p>
<p>Then, he learned how to make dogwood baskets, Finnish puukko knives,
carved spoons, Swedish shrink boxes, Windsor stools, trestle work
benches, birchbark berry baskets and artisan breads.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't tell you enough how much I learn from those teachers up
there; it's incredible,&quot; said Knutson. &quot;They're so young for what
they know, and I can't believe they know so much about the old ways of
doing things.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of the classes take several days, so Knutson gets a room at Lund's
Motel and eats meals at the Pie Place. Eventually, he became part of the
North House community, even organizing a benefit when one of the
instructors suffered a stroke.</p>
<p>&quot;I fell in love with the people and the area,&quot; Knutson said. &quot;And it
just went on and on.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/l/clearing_photo_class.jpg" alt="A photo class in Door County." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>The Scandinavian influence</h3>
<p>Like the North House, the Clearing in Door County was founded on the
Scandinavian tradition of folk schools - but 62 years earlier, in
1935.</p>
<p>Its founder, Danish landscape architect Jens Jensen, meant for it to be
a place where ordinary people could escape the city to learn and relax
in a beautiful, stress-free setting.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing formal about anything here,&quot; says director Mike
Schneider. &quot;If you want to skip class, you can do that; I encourage it
sometimes, on a nice day.&quot;</p>
<p>In winter, classes are held all over Door County, but in summer,
they're held in and around lovely stone buildings on the 130-acre
wooded campus near Ellison Bay.</p>
<p>There are courses on science, history, theater, film and religion as
well as the arts, but the hands-on classes fill fastest, Schneider
says.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Learning vacations at folk schools</h3>
<p>If the school is in a popular resort area and you will need lodgings,
register as early as possible and make sure you can get a place to
stay.</p>
<p>Often, students can save money by camping nearby and paying the commuter
rate. Some schools, such as the North House, offer an early-bird
discount.</p>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
