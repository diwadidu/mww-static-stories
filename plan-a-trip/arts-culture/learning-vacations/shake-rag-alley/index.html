<p>In southwest Wisconsin, it is natural that people gather in Mineral
Point to smash plates, snip glass and cover themselves in cement dust.</p>
<p>Not far to the west, a German-born priest built the Dickeyville Grotto
from conch shells, china cups, quartz, petrified rocks and glass.</p>
<p>Just to the east, an Austrian-born cheesemaker encrusted his house with
glass &quot;jewels&quot; and filled his yard with concrete fairy-tale figures.</p>
<p>And in Mineral Point, the very air — faintly chalky from damp
limestone — is thick with artistic impulses.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, an aesthete and an artist began restoring the town's
lovely but crumbling Cornish cottages, and other artists followed them.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, a collection of nine miners' cottages and cabins, six of
them no older than the 1840s, became home to artisans and antique
dealers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In 2004, it became Shake Rag Alley Center for Arts &amp; Crafts, where
anyone can become an artist.</p>
<p>At one popular workshop, students make the kinds of concrete sculptures
for which Wisconsin roadsides are famous, plus garden stepping stones,
bird baths and anything else they want to fashion out of concrete,
mortar, pebbles, ceramics and glass.</p>
<p>One year, I signed up for it.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be intimidated; no one here really knows what they're
doing,&quot; Paula O'Kray of Stevens Point told me when I arrived late.</p>
<p>O'Kray was making a concrete peacock, using curled telephone wire for
feathers. That was instructor Judy Sutcliffe's idea. She had many good
ideas, also suggesting that Tonie Rocke of Mount Horeb use the broken
china cup she'd brought not in the mosaic but as the head of her garden
lady, with trailing vines for hair.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mineral_point_mosaic_judy_students.jpg" alt="Judy Sutcliffe helps students at Shake Rag Alley." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Working under tents beside a burbling spring, we first made armatures by
sinking steel rods into plastic bowls filled with wet concrete. While
that set, we made bird baths by draping a giant rhubarb leaf over a
mound of wet sand, then covering it with concrete.</p>
<p>Some people made garden stepping stones, lining the bottom of small
pizza boxes with leaves, then filling them with concrete.</p>
<p>That was easy compared with our sculptures. For those, the next step was
molding chicken wire around balled-up newspaper and foam balls and
attaching it to the steel rods. We covered our armatures with two layers
of concrete, then used mortar to attach a mosaic chosen from bins full
of broken crockery, tiles, glass and mirrors.</p>
<p>Some people brought their own gewgaws; everyone admired Nancy Welch for
her forks with curled tines, which she embedded into a heart sculpture.
Welch, of Madison, was one of several art teachers taking the workshop.</p>
<p>&quot;I always say that at this time of year I don't have any ideas left,
because I've given them all away,&quot; said Deb Hyland, an art teacher
in Galena, Ill. &quot;I never have any time to do anything for myself.&quot;</p>
<p>But that left the rest of us wondering if our creativity would measure
up.</p>
<p>&quot;I was really apprehensive about doing this, it's so far out of my
comfort zone,&quot; said Carolyn Iwanski of Stevens Point, who made a bird
house. &quot;I'm not the artistic type.&quot;</p>
<p>I felt the pressure, too, and it made me briefly lose sight of why I
love &quot;outsider&quot; art: It's unstudied, imperfect and exuberantly
original.</p>
<p>So when I complained that the glass pieces I was cutting were
&quot;irregular,&quot; Sutcliffe burst out laughing, and instructor Heidi
Dyas-McBeth gave me a strange look.</p>
<p>&quot;Irregular is good,&quot; she reminded me.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It was Sutcliffe and Longbranch Gallery partner Sandy Scott who
spearheaded the drive to buy Shake Rag Alley, which they had been using
for their annual Woodlanders Gathering of rustic-furniture makers.</p>
<p>All of their workshops are hands-on; for the concrete/mosaic class,
Sutcliffe and Dyas-McBeth mostly circulated among the students,
answering questions and offering advice.</p>
<p>&quot;This is so encouraging, so supportive and so unlike the real world,
you don't want to leave,&quot; said O'Kray, who had attended the
Woodlanders weekend and planned to return.</p>
<p>I didn't want to leave, either. Mineral Point not only is beautiful —
it was the first city in Wisconsin to be listed on the National Register
of Historic Places — but it has to be the friendliest place in the
Upper Midwest.</p>
<p>Everywhere I went, townspeople said hello and asked how I was; as I
listened to the free Friday-evening concert at the Orchard Lawn mansion,
the president of the historical society came over to welcome me and
introduce himself.</p>

<p>People get involved in this town of 2,600; after all, it raised
$100,000 toward the purchase of Shake Rag Alley in just six weeks,
saving it from becoming a private vacation retreat.</p>
<p>In other towns, Shake Rag Alley would have become a trophy home for a
tycoon, and it came close. But Mineral Point isn't just any town, and
residents want to keep it that way.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people have very loving feelings for this property,&quot; Sandy
Scott says. &quot;There's been a lot of history passing through here.&quot;</p>
