<p>I coulda been a contender.</p>
<p>I played tennis as a kid, teaching myself on the courts near my house,
and I played on my high school girls' tennis team, which, while not very
competitive, had an actual coach thanks to Title IX.</p>
<p>But I never took lessons, and after high school, my budding skills slid
into disuse. The years passed and I became a has-been, with nothing to
look forward to but the senior varsity.</p>
<p>I still like to whack a ball, though, and one year I heard about a place
where, finally, I could learn to do it better.</p>
<p>In 1977, Gustavus Adolphus coach Steve Wilkinson, who already had a
men's tennis dynasty going on the St. Peter campus, started Tennis and
Life summer camps. My friend Grace attended them as an ambitious
junior-high player, and she suggested we sign up for an adult camp.</p>
<p>&quot;I used to have dinner and then go out by myself and hit some more
balls,&quot; she said. &quot;But that was 20 years ago, and I've changed. I'm
lazier now, I'll want to have some vino in the evenings.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>So we went, but we didn't drink wine. We hit — and hit, and hit some
more.</p>
<p>From 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., we hit balls. In spite of the young instructors'
sunny smiles, and the goofy skits, and the lighthearted rides in
Wilkinson's &quot;Magic Bus,&quot; there was no mistaking the purpose of the
weekend. People were having fun, but they were there to play and to
learn.</p>
<p>After the first clinic, we got a pep talk from assistant director Dan
McLaughlin.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of you are panicking already,&quot; he said. &quot;Remember, some people
have been at these camps for 18 years. So you've got 18 years to learn
some of these things.&quot;</p>
<p>From the beginning, the instructors — one for every four students —
set an astonishingly high standard. I'd wondered why they said my name
whenever they saw me, but found out why on the morning of the first full
day, when they arranged us in a circle and took turns reciting our names
by memory — all 99 of them.</p>
<p>Students came mostly from the Midwest, but also from Arizona, Texas,
Colorado, Florida, Mississippi and British Columbia. Sako Ogata got the
prize for coming the farthest, from Japan, where she plays at a tennis
club.</p>
<p>&quot;I told no one,&quot; she said. &quot;They would envy me if they knew I came all
the way to the U.S. for tennis camp.&quot;</p>
<p>After breakfast, we'd watch exhibition matches, stretch, and see a skit.
Then we'd break into groups for drills with an instructor, who'd
patiently remind us to step into the swing, keep our wrists firm, point
our shoulders at the net and follow through.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;See, I've learned something already,&quot; said Sharon Johnson of
Bloomington, a member of my group who said she didn't start to learn
tennis until she was 50. &quot;You can teach an old person new tricks.&quot;</p>
<p>In the indoor complex, other instructors led us through station drills.
The first day, McLaughlin fixed my tendency to wallop the ball, rather
than direct it.</p>
<p>The second day, Gustavus player Jon Farnsworth adjusted my grip and
taught me to throw the ball up for a serve; fellow Gustie Jenni Edlund
stood behind me, shouting 'Hit' to make me swing when it was still high
in the air. At least three different instructors politely reminded me to
bring up my non-hitting hand.</p>
<p>Everywhere we went, there was a smiling instructor at our elbows,
analyzing our play and offering helpful tips. And they always knew our
names.</p>
<p>The name game, along with high-fives and little blue &quot;Camper of the
Day&quot; nominations from our instructors — &quot;She focused and worked very
hard&quot;; &quot;Diligent worker on her serve&quot; — are part of an intentional
pattern of affirmation.</p>
<p>&quot;The culture in this society is, 'It's all about me,' &quot; Steve
Wilkinson says. &quot;We counter that by learning the game 'It's all about
you.' &quot;</p>
<p>As the sports world becomes increasingly boorish, from professional to
peewee leagues, Wilkinson is a virtual revolutionary. He's the Mr.
Rogers of tennis, advocating a kinder, gentler way to play.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>That's why this isn't just tennis camp — it's tennis and life camp,
and each day included sportsmanship and mental-training sessions with
McLaughlin, director Neal Hagberg and Wilkinson, who teaches sports
ethics at Gustavus and started the camps as a way to put his principles
into practice.</p>
<p>If your opponent cheats or makes a wrong call, Wilkinson told us, say
nothing and congratulate him after the match. Don't dwell on your
mistakes, and don't apologize for them to your partner. Have fun and
don't even think about winning, only on making a full effort.</p>
<p>And these principles work like a charm. Wilkinson's Gustavus team
routinely wins division titles; Wilkinson himself has been the nation's
top-ranked player in the 45, 50, 55 and 60 and over age categories.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't think of anything that makes a bigger difference,&quot; Wilkinson
said. &quot;Having fun and being a good sport are far more important than
being the national champion.&quot; But paradoxically, he says, players who
internalize these principles set themselves free — to win.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a huge competitive advantage for me doing this,&quot; he said. &quot;It
allows me to play my game.&quot;</p>
<p>We swung, we listened, we absorbed. But Grace and I also did a little
relaxing. One evening, we went to the college's Lund Center to soothe
our muscles in the whirlpool, alongside four tough and wiry Twin Cities
women we called &quot;The Aces.&quot;</p>
<p>We shared beer in the dorm with some merry women from Memphis, and on
the last night we went to a concert in the dormitory lounge given by
Hagberg and his wife, Leandra Peak, known to folk aficionados around the
nation as the duo Neal &amp; Leandra.</p>
<p>That was a treat, to say the least. But the best thing the camp gave me
was a renewed appreciation for the game, and a determination to not let
it fall by the wayside again.</p>
<p>As I learned in one of McLaughlin's mental-training sessions, &quot;The race
belongs not just to the swift and strong, but to those who keep
running.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Summer sports camps for adults</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_runner_cropped.jpg" alt="A runner passes Chicago's Oak Street Beach." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Running camps help runners train for big races.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you have doubts about whether you'll fit in, call the camp and
describe your abilities or expectations; staff will help you decide if
it's the right place for you. Ask about the proportion of instructors to
students and how many hours of instruction are included.</p>
