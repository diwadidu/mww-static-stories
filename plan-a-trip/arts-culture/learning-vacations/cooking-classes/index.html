<h2>On weekend getaways, amateur chefs can test their mettle in the kitchen.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/elkhart_lake_cooking.jpg" alt="A cooking class at the Osthoff." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At the Osthoff in Elkhart Lake, student cooks prepared a polenta
appetizer with prosciutto, Gorgonzola and mushrooms.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you think you're a pretty good cook, just take a class at a cooking
school and see how fast you change your mind.</p>
<p>When I showed up at L'ecole de la Maison at the Osthoff Resort, 18
detailed recipes were awaiting our group of eight students.</p>
<p><em>Everything</em> had to be made from scratch: sheets of pasta and two sauces
for the seafood rotolo, rolled cheese crisps for the salad, ladyfingers
for the tiramisu. The ciabatta bread, too.</p>
<p>Who cooks like this? Restaurant chefs, like our hard-working teacher,
Scott Baker. We were agog with admiration.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm never going to complain about expensive restaurants again,&quot; one
student said. &quot;It's so time-consuming.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We tried to work fast, but we kept bumping up against unfamiliar terms
and techniques.</p>
<p>I didn't know how to make a parsley chiffonade, or that you're
supposed to wash each layer of a leek.</p>
<p>It took me ages to carve the membrane off blood-orange segments. I
forgot to put chopped onion into the osso buco broth, and it turned out
that I'd been using my beloved garlic press all wrong.</p>
<p>Drain the ricotta, sweat the leeks, blanch the pasta — it was like a
ballet, an endless succession of small steps, and Baker was our
Baryshnikov, graceful and focused but never hurried.</p>
<p>Four hours later, having grated piles of Parmesan and mounds of onions,
leeks, shallots and garlic, we sat down to an insanely rich five-course
Italian meal.</p>
<p>Making it was intense, but a lot of fun.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/elkhart_lake_osthoff_chef.jpg" alt="Osthoff Resort cooking class." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;I loved to cook until I had kids,&quot; said another student. &quot;Then I
<em>had</em> to cook, and it took all of the happiness out of it.&quot;</p>
<p>At the Osthoff in Elkhart Lake, Wis., classes are participation (and
how!), as opposed to demonstration.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been to a lot of demonstrations, and I think I'll retain
everything, but I don't,&quot; Baker said. &quot;You don't learn as much.&quot;</p>
<p>But many people prefer demonstration classes, which involve more
entertainment than elbow grease.</p>
<p>&quot;The most relaxing thing is to watch some other chef work really hard
while you sit and watch with a glass of wine,&quot; says chef Stephen
Larson, a longtime chef in Minnesota bluff country.</p>
<p>Larson, with his assistant/wife, &quot;the beautiful and talented Lisa&quot;
Flicker, offers cooking classes that are part magic show, part chemistry
lab and part comedy routine.</p>
<p>&quot;We instill the confidence that our guests can go home and do it
themselves,&quot; Larson says.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Demonstration is a lot more user-friendly, especially for the guys.
We're seeing more retired guys, and in general, the wife has to drag
the guy to class. So we say, 'No, you don't have to do anything.'
&quot;</p>
<p>In participation classes, students prepare the dishes and the chefs
circulate among them, offering help with techniques.</p>
<p>In our class at the Osthoff, Baker made the pasta, though one student
tried (and failed) to feed it through the roller properly, and he let us
roll it for boiling (the same student rolled cheesecloth into it, but
another student caught her before it was too late).</p>
<p>In shorter classes, students break into groups and may get to prepare
only one of the meal's dishes, but in longer classes, like our 4½-hour
Northern Italian Trattoria class, students can have a hand in all of
them.</p>
<p>For many people, cooking classes are entertainment, one more fun thing
to do on a weekend getaway.</p>

<p>At the sprawling Osthoff Resort in Elkhart Lake, guests can learn to
make cream puffs in the morning, then get a massage or facial at the
resort's spa.</p>
<p>Some B&amp;Bs offer occasional classes, and many kitchen store and
restaurant offer them.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to have fun on a weekend getaway. But when you
take a cooking class, you know you'll eat well, too.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Cooking-class getaways</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to take a cooking class at a resort, plan your own
getaway centered around a class at one of the many schools and
restaurants in the region. Below are some of the schools in fun tourist
areas.</p>
<p>If you're thinking about taking a class, get on the school's mailing
list so you get first crack at them; many weekend classes fill quickly.
Schools also offer private classes to groups, with a minimum of four to
10.</p>
