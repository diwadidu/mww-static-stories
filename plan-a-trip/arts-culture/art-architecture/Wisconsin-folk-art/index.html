<h2>Love goofy roadside attractions? Here's where to find them, from Snow White to Sacagawea.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/o/fountain_city_prairie_moon.jpg" alt="Folk-art sculptures at Prairie Moon." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Dinosaurs join castles and bears at Herman Rusch's Prairie Moon.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the early days of highway travel, some very ordinary folks toiled to
enliven Wisconsin's roadsides.</p>
<p>Concrete dinosaurs appeared, and a muskie pulled by horses. King Neptune
held court next to Snow White and her dwarves.</p>
<p>There was an ocean liner encrusted with glass, a  Hindu temple and
mythic figures from the American frontier — Sacagawea, Paul Bunyan,
Kit Carson.</p>
<p>The neighbors of lumberjack Fred Smith thought he was a crackpot. But
his 203 concrete-and-glass figures in northern Wisconsin draw thousands
of visitors from around the world.</p>
<p>Along the Mississippi, a farmer who couldn't even put up a clothesline
suddenly began to build lifelike dinosaurs and a beautifully arched
concrete fence, with conical red posts tipped in gold.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the south, a cheesemaker with a sly sense of humor adorned his yard
with concrete fairy-tale figures and his house with glass &quot;jewels.&quot;</p>
<p>For some reason, Wisconsin was a particularly fertile ground for
self-taught artists, who had big imaginations but no commercial
aspirations at all.</p>
<p>Most of these quirky &quot;art environments&quot; were crumbling when the
<a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/preserved-sites/">Kohler
Foundation</a>
in Sheboygan stepped in. It carefully restored them, then turned them
over to local stewards.</p>
<p>Five of the sites are in the river valleys and coulees of southwest
Wisconsin. A visit would make a fantastic fall road trip, taking
pilgrims from the foot of the Mississippi River bluffs north of La
Crosse to the far tip of the state, near Galena, Ill.</p>
<p>A sixth is in the north woods, near one of the best stretches of the Ice
Age National Scenic Trail and Timms Hill, Wisconsin's highest point.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/o/fountain_city_prairie_moon_fence.jpg" alt="A fence at Prairie Moon Sculpture Garden." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The bejeweled concrete fence around Herman Rusch's Prairie Moon
Sculpture Garden is an unexpected sight along the Mississippi River
bluffs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From there, the trail heads south, to a grotto near Wisconsin Rapids,
and then east to Sheboygan, home of the eighth site and the superb John
Michael Kohler Arts Center.</p>
<p>These places are a good excuse to hit the road in any season. Here's
what you'll see.</p>
<h3>Prairie Moon Sculpture Garden, north of <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/fountain-city-wisconsin/">Fountain City</a></h3>
<p>This site along the Mississippi River is the northernmost stop on a
five-site tour of southwest Wisconsin.</p>
<p>In 1955, farmer Herman Rusch had retired and was keeping a museum of
oddities in an old dance pavilion, where he often played his fiddle for
visitors.</p>
<p>&quot;He collected all kinds of really weird stuff,&quot; said conservator Ken
Haeuser. &quot;He had a tree where someone had left a scythe hanging in the
crotch, and the tree grew around it; we still have that.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;But he got kind of bored with the museum, so he built a planter
outside. Then he said that looked so lonely, so he built another
one.&quot;</p>
<p>Rusch then built another three dozen concrete sculptures, including a
Hindu temple, three dinosaurs, a crenellated stone watchtower and his
arched fence, made by molding concrete over the iron wheels of old grain
drills.</p>
<p>He also installed three sculptures by Halvor Landsverk, a farmer from
Rushford, Minn., including a Norwegian hunter fighting off a bear.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of times, when people retire, they take a whole different
direction,&quot; Haeuser says.</p>
<p>It's been called &quot;dementia concretia.&quot; But Rusch called it &quot;a good
way to kill old-age boredom.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/preserved-sites/prairie-moon-sculpture-garden-and-museum/">Prairie Moon Sculpture Garden and
Museum</a></strong>
is 11 miles south of Alma and three miles south of Cochrane. Look for
Prairie Moon Road from Wisconsin 35.</p>
<p>From Fountain City, head east to the town of Cataract.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Wegner Grotto, north of Sparta</h3>
<p>Car dealer Paul Wegner had been retired for two years when, said
grandson Don Wegner, he decided to &quot;dress up the yard a little bit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He said, 'I don't like to hunt, I don't like to fish, I want to do
something worthwhile with my time,' &quot; Wegner said. He and his wife,
Matilda — the boss of the operation, their grandson says - first
built a glass church, inspired by the Dickeyville Grotto in the
southwest corner of the state.</p>
<p>Then they built an American flag, a replica of their 50th-anniversary
cake, a big white heart, a star and the Bremen ocean liner, all
brilliantly adorned with bits of glass, crockery, porcelain and
seashells.</p>
<p>The ship reminded them of the one on which they had emigrated from
Germany, where Paul had apprenticed with a stonemason, Wegner said.</p>
<p>No one seemed to think their hobby unusual, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They were just conventional people,&quot; he said. &quot;There was nothing
hippie or yippie or artistic about them.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/preserved-sites/wegner-grotto/">The Paul and Matilda Wegner

<h3>Grandview, between <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/mineral-point-art-tour/">Mineral Point</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-glarus-wisconsin/">New Glarus</a></h3>
<p>Austrian-born Nick Engelbert was a naval officer who jumped ship to
become a gold prospector and, eventually, a dairy farmer. He loved his
rural home: &quot;If a man can't be happy on a little farm in Wisconsin, he
hasn't the makings of happiness in his soul,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But when he was in his 50s, around 1937, he fell off his roof and badly
sprained his ankle. Unable to move around much, he retreated to a garage
workshop.</p>
<p>&quot;He hunkered in there all alone, and when he came out, he'd made a
little clay thing with glass on it,&quot; said Ricky Rolfsmeyer, who lives
nearby and oversees Grandview. &quot;That's all she wrote. From that point
on, he went nuts.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/hollandale_triton.jpg" alt="Roadside Distractions." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Grandview, King Neptune rules over a fountain.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>He covered the family's clapboard house with concrete and glass, built
more sculptures - an organ grinder, a Viking in a boat, Snow White and
the Seven Dwarves, a stork with a baby, a Hapsburg castle and King
Neptune in his fountain.</p>
<p>One sculpture, The Family Tree, depicted his four children as monkeys.</p>
<p>Engelbert also installed picnic tables for the gawkers.</p>
<p>&quot;He didn't care that neighboring farmers said, 'You're goofier than
hell to be building these statues.' He didn't care,&quot; Rolfsmeyer
said.</p>
<p>Around 1951, after filling his yard, Engelbert switched to oil painting,
and many of his works now hang in his former house.</p>

<h3>Dickeyville Grotto, Dickeyville</h3>
<p>This series of grottos and shrines of concrete, embellished with stones,
glass, tile, crockery and shells, largely inspired the tradition of
sculptural expression in Wisconsin and around the region.</p>
<p>It was created between 1925 and 1930 by a German-born priest named
Mathias Wernerus at Holy Ghost Church in Dickeyville, in the extreme
southwest corner of the state. Parishioners contributed treasures
they'd scavenged from around the nation and helped with construction.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dickeyvillegrotto.com">The Dickeyville
Grotto</a></strong> is off U.S. 151, 12 miles
north of Dubuque, Iowa. The gift shop is open daily from May through
October.</p>
<p>The next site is in north-central Wisconsin, between Ladysmith and
Tomahawk.</p>

<h3>Wisconsin Concrete Park, Phillips</h3>
<p>Everyone around the town Phillips thought Fred Smith was unusual, to say
the least. Of course, Fred Smith <em>was</em> unusual.</p>
<p>Between 1950 and 1964, the flamboyant retired lumberjack and tavern
owner built 203 massive figures, wrapping lumber frameworks with mink
wire and covering them with layers of concrete and a mosaic of broken
beer bottles.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody knows why I made them, not even me,&quot; he said. &quot;This work
just came to me naturally . . . It's gotta be in ya to do it.&quot;</p>
<p>He made the man who delivered kerosene to local farmers in an ox-drawn
wagon and Mabel the Milker, who milked by hand.</p>
<p>He built the whole Budweiser Clydesdale team and also Kit Carson, Paul
Bunyan and Sacagawea, the Shoshone woman who led the explorers Lewis and
Clark.</p>
<p>&quot;She's the one who opened up the whole country,&quot; Smith said.
&quot;That's why I got so many Indians here. I like Indians because
they're damn smart people.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1964, a stroke forced Smith into a rest home, but even there he
retained his <em>joie de vivre</em> : &quot;I've
been having a good time all my life!&quot; he said. He died in 1976.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.friendsoffredsmith.org">Wisconsin Concrete Park</a> is just
south of Phillips on Wisconsin 13, just north of U.S. 8.</p>

<h3>Rudolph Grotto, near Wisconsin Rapids</h3>
<p>While studying for the priesthood in Europe, Philip Wagner became ill.
On a visit to the Grotto of Our Lady in Lourdes, France, in 1912, he
prayed for health and promised to build a shrine to the Virgin Mary.</p>
<p>He recovered and collected ideas around Europe that he used when he was
appointed pastor in Rudolph in 1917. He embellished the grounds of the
church, now called St. Philip's, over many years.</p>
<p>Today, features include the Wonder Cave, a soldiers memorial, a
playhouse and many rock bridges and pillar planters encrusted with bits
of tile, abalone and glass.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rudolphgrotto.org">Rudolph Grotto</a> is eight miles north of
Wisconsin Rapids off Wisconsin 34.</p>
<p>From Rudolph, head east to Green Bay and south along the shores of Lake
Michigan.</p>

Garden.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>James Tellen Woodland Sculpture Garden, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/sheboygan-wisconsin/">Sheboygan</a></h3>
<p>James Tellen worked in a furniture factory in Sheboygan, painting
decorative details. In 1942, in a hospital recovering from an illness,
he was inspired by the concrete sculptures he could see in the
churchyard across the street.</p>
<p>For the remaining 15 years of his life, he created concrete figures for
the yard of his log summer cottage, often displaying the sly humor also
seen at Nick Engelbert's Grandview.</p>
<p>In the hollow of a tree, below elves snickering in the branches,
visitors look past a sign that reads, &quot;If you look into this tree, the
one you love best you will see,&quot; and into a mirror.</p>
<p>A piece inscribed &quot;We whistle while we work&quot; shows the Seven Dwarves
in party mode, playing musical instruments and making wine. A tavern
scene shows a woman scolding a man who has toppled onto his hands and
knees, while four proper townsfolk look on.</p>
<p>Like Fred Smith, he liked to create pioneer scenes, including a young
Abraham Lincoln splitting a log. His first work, the 65-foot-long
&quot;Fallen Log,&quot; is a free-form fence that features a bear, cubs and an
Indian man, woman and child.</p>
<p>But Tellen also was deeply religious, and a boardwalk leads through the
wooded back yard to a miniature basilica, a bust of Christ and a statue
of the Virgin of Fatima.</p>

A light tower is one of many pieces by Carl Peterson on the grounds of
Kohler Arts Center.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Unlike Smith, Tellen had the encouragement of his friends and family,
and his 1957 obituary in the Sheboygan Press called his sculpture
environment &quot;one of the finest exhibits of outdoor art in the state.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/preserved-sites/tellen-woodland-sculpture-garden/">James Tellen Woodland Sculpture
Garden</a></strong>
is in a quiet neighborhood just south of Sheboygan. From Wisconsin 28,
turn east on County Road EE, then go south on Evergreen Drive about 1
mile, just past Indian Mound Road.</p>
<h3>John Michael Kohler Arts Center, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/sheboygan-wisconsin/">Sheboygan</a></h3>
<p>This lively arts center contains rotating exhibits and permanent
collections, which include many pieces retrieved and restored from the
southwest Minnesota farm town of St. James.</p>
<p>That's where blacksmith and cabinetmaker <a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/relocated-sculptures/carl-peterson-sculptures/"><strong>Carl
Peterson</strong></a>
created his Environmental Sculpture Garden of Nature from the turn of
the century to 1940.</p>
<p>The pieces were removed and scattered, but Kohler curators were able to
retrieve many from auction and restore them. Now, 15 of his large-scale
pieces - light towers, fountains, castle-like birdbaths - can be
viewed in the arts center's gardens.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jmkac.org">John Michael Kohler Art Center</a> is on New York
Avenue on the edge of downtown Sheboygan, not far from the lake. It's
open daily, and admission is free.</p>

<h3>Elsewhere around Wisconsin</h3>
<p>In the Door County village of <em>Baileys Harbor</em> , a Polish immigrant
loved birds. He'd spent his teen-age years hiding from Nazis in the
woods, where the birds were his only friends.</p>
<p>Eventually, he filled his house and yard with more than 2,000
birdhouses, hand-carved cedar birds, angels, woodsmen, sailors, ships
and woodland creatures.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/major-collections/albert-zahn/">Albert Zahn's Birds
Park</a>
and house, however, privately owned and not open to the public.
Occasionally, tours are available as part of fund-raising efforts.</p>
<p>In the posh <em>Milwaukee suburb of Fox Point</em> , on Lake Michigan, the
sculpture-filled <a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/preserved-sites/mary-nohl-home-and-sculptures/">Mary Nohl
site</a>
is owned by the Kohler Foundation, but neighbors have contested its use
as a public attraction, and it cannot be seen.</p>
<p>It's on the National Register of Historic Places and in 2005 was listed
by the Wisconsin Preservation Trust as one of the 10 most endangered
properties in the state. Here's a lovely <a href="http://gregcookland.com/wonderland/2018/07/27/mary-nohl/">story about Nohl and her
house</a>, with
many photos.</p>
<p>Along U.S. 12 south of <em>Baraboo</em> , wrecker and salvager Tom Every turned
scrap parts into outlandish creatures, symbols and machines, including
the
<a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/museums-galleries/dr-evermors-forevertron-198057">Forevertron</a>, a time and intergalactic travel contraption that apparently is the
world's largest scrap-metal sculpture.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.worldofdrevermor.com/visit-dr.-evermore-s-park-c10896.html">Dr. Evermor's Sculpture
Park</a>
is seven miles south of Baraboo, next to Delaney Surplus. Nothing is
labeled, but visitors are free to wander and look when the park is open;
check for hours.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.wisconsinfrights.com/roadside-oddities-oshkosh/">M. Schettl
Sales</a> near
<em>Oshkosh</em> , the overgrown grounds are a collection of salvaged oddities
and statuary that include dragons, gargoyles, dinosaurs, circus animals,
aliens and mermaids (though no guarantees, since they're for sale). The
shop is at 5105 County Road S, south of Butte des Morts.</p>

Milwaukee, the <a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/arts-and-culture/paul-bobrowitz-spectacular-sculpture-garden-353108">Paul Bobrowitz Spectacular Sculpture
Garden</a>
features offbeat pieces as well as more sophisticated modern sculptures,
