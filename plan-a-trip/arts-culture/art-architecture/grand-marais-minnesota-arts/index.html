<h2>On Minnesota's North Shore, this once-rugged village is a cultural outpost.</h2>

<p>A hundred years ago, Grand Marais was a wind-buffeted outpost at the tip
of the North Shore, stomping grounds of trappers, loggers and fishermen.</p>
<p>The dirt road connecting the village to Duluth often was impassable, and
winter provisions had to be brought in by steamer before Lake Superior
iced over.</p>
<p>But amid the hardship, there was always art.</p>
<p>Swedish immigrant Anna Johnson was first to create and sell art, at the
log trading post she operated with her husband after their 1907
marriage. Trained at Augustana College in Rockford, Ill., she painted,
drew and worked in stained glass, leather and ceramics.</p>
<p>Some of her many oils now hang in a log replica of her store, the
Johnson Heritage Post Gallery.</p>
<p>Other artists came, settling their easels in front of the picturesque
fish houses and clapboard churches. One of those artists, a professor
from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, founded the Grand Marais
Art Colony in 1947.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Its classes drew serious artists from the Twin Cities, but also fed the
creativity of the locals, many of whom had been taught by Anna Johnson
in the schools.</p>
<p>The Art Colony still flourishes in Grand Marais, offering workshops for
visual artists,  writers and dancers. The Grand Marais Playhouse has
been staging plays since 1971, now in the Arrowhead Center for the Arts,
a $3.5 million testament to the importance of arts in a village of only
1,350.</p>
<p>The center also is the home base for the North Shore Music Association,
which brings in musicians.</p>
<p>On the harbor, the North House Folk School teaches traditional crafts in
a building painted Swedish red and nautical skills on a green
twin-masted schooner named the Hjordis.</p>
<p>Creativity, obviously, is in the air.</p>

<p>&quot;It's that lake,&quot; says Jim Mahle, who passes on village lore as a Cook
County History Museum volunteer. &quot;You can go anywhere here and get a
good scene. It shows why that colony went over so well.&quot;</p>
<p>Built down a hillside and around a natural harbor, Grand Marais looks
good in watercolors and pastels. The Sawtooth Mountains rise behind the
village; in front of it, a breakwall connects the rocky outcropping of
Artist's Point to a small white pier light.</p>
<p>The surrounding forests are where the artists live, bringing their works
into town to sell. Sometimes, however, they can be seen in town. Over
Eight Broadway Art Gallery, a sign hangs: &quot;Art in Progress.&quot;</p>
<p>On any given day, artists and artisans are at work all around Grand
Marais. One weekend when I was there, North House had scheduled
workshops on Norwegian rosemaling, Anishinabe crooked-knife making,
building with stone and the Great Lakes schooner trade.</p>
<p>There also was a half-day Hike Into the Past led by founder Mark Hanson,
which is what I joined. Hanson led seven of us past Hovland, into the
woods and around Horseshoe Bay, where we came upon a cobblestone beach.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It was the site of the Penta Arcanums, or five mysteries, which Hanson
himself found three years ago on a camping trip.</p>
<p>They're post-Ice Age pits stacked into the beach — elsewhere around
Lake Superior, they're known as Pukaskwa Pits - that Canadian
archaeologists believe are man-made.</p>
<p>&quot;If they're man-made, this is very, very early man in North America,&quot;
Hanson said. &quot;That makes you think.&quot;</p>
<p>Some Ojibwe believe they're thunderbird nests, he said; others speculate
that they represent star formations or were used as fish traps, food
storage or watching posts. One Arcanum is the lake's biggest at 4 feet
deep.</p>
<p>On the way back, Hanson talked about the folk school, which he started
after traveling to Greenland and Norway, which has dozens of such
schools.</p>

<p>&quot;We'd like to get people away from the television and the computer
screen and get their hands busy,&quot; said Hanson, who teaches students how
to build birchbark canoes and Inuit kayaks.</p>
<p>&quot;This school is about giving them an appreciation for the simpler
things in life. It takes a heroic effort to start a school like this,
but a lot of people have come to the party with a lot of enthusiasm.&quot;</p>
<p>At the Cook County History Museum's art room, I admired a painting of
net menders by Ade Toftey, the newspaper's late owner and editor, and
one of a boat captain by Grand Marais artist Howard Sivertson, who grew
up on Isle Royale and has become the pictorial chronicler of North Shore
history.</p>
<p>His work is sold around the corner at Sivertson Gallery, which also
displays his daughter Liz's bold, colorful paintings, the woodcuts of
local artist Betsy Bowen and the nature photos of Ely's Jim Brandenberg.</p>
<p>Down the street, in the renovated Fireweed Building, the Gunflint Tavern
hosts live music on weekends.</p>
<p>The sunny &quot;tavern&quot;  has a dozen ales and lagers on tap and offers
such dishes as tiramisu, tabouli and black-peppered salmon with chipotle
dressing and mangos.</p>

<p>Grand Marais always has been a little more cultured, a little more
creative than a remote town on the North Shore ought to be. And, with a
century of momentum, it may just be gearing up.</p>
