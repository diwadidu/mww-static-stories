<h2>A Wisconsin village on the Mississippi River is the capital of the offbeat and unexpected.</h2>

The bejeweled concrete fence around Herman Rusch's Prairie Moon
Sculpture Garden is an unexpected sight along the Mississippi River
bluffs.

<p>It's easy to speed right through the river town of Fountain City, on
the way to someplace else, but that would be a mistake.</p>
<p>In Fountain City, all is not as it seems. A Hindu temple sits amid hay
fields. One of the world's largest collections of toy pedal cars
occupies five barns on a bluff. Dreamlike Santas ride fish in a
riverfront studio, models for copies sold around the nation.</p>
<p>On this seemingly ordinary stretch of the Mississippi, people have been
inspired by . . . something. Perhaps it's the dramatic bluffs that loom
above town.</p>
<p>One morning in 1995, they sent a 55-ton boulder slamming into a house,
which, overnight, became a tourist attraction. That's the kind of thing
that makes a person look twice at his surroundings.</p>
<p>If you're coming from the north, go past Pepin, past Alma, past
Cochrane — but not too far past Cochrane. For there is the first sight
to be seen.</p>
<p>One of Wisconsin's many folk-art savants left his legacy here, within
view of the highway. Herman Rusch was a retired farmer who, looking for
&quot;a good way to kill old-age boredom,&quot; began fashioning sculptures
out of concrete, stone and broken glass.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>By the time he died in 1985 at age 100 — &quot;Beauty creates the will to
live,&quot; he said — he'd fashioned nearly 40 sculptures, including a
Hindu temple, three dinosaurs, a crenellated stone watchtower and a
beautiful arched fence, with conical red posts tipped with gold.</p>
<p>Today, they've been restored and still sit on the grounds of the old
Prairie Moon Dance Pavilion, which Rusch filled with curios and where he
once lived in a trailer.</p>
<p>There's a self-portrait in concrete, but it's a poor substitute for
the real Rusch, who often played his fiddle for visitors.</p>
<p>&quot;I met Herman Rusch when he was almost 100,&quot; says Leo Smith, a
renowned carver who works in Fountain City. &quot;He was a little bitty guy
who was always smiling, and when he played the fiddle, he exuded
joy.&quot;</p>
<p>Smith and his wife, Marilyn, lived in Fountain City for more than 30
years, and they, too, are folk artists. Collectors will recognize them
as the creators of colorfully detailed Santas, which, like Rusch's
works, convey an infectious mirth; reproductions are sold in Winona at
the Minnesota Marine Art Museum.</p>

<p>But they make many other pieces, too, often incorporating what they see
around them — water lotuses from the sloughs, fish, even neighbors and
figures from local Indian mythology.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of magic here, a lot of wonderful totems  — eagles,
wild turkeys, deer up in the hills, lots of fishing — and they're an
inspiration every day,&quot; says Leo Smith.</p>
<p>There's a whole shelf full of Leo Smith pieces in the family room of
Elmer and Bernadette Duellman, 2½ miles above town on a ridge
overlooking the river. There's also a 1929 Ford Phaeton and an alcove
of antique metal toys, any one of which would cause a stampede at a flea
market.</p>
<p>And that's just the house. In another building, there are shelves and
shelves of toys - a Tom Corbett Space Cadet, a Cocoa Puff train, a
Popeye, hundreds of vehicles of all kinds.</p>
<p>In four other buildings, there are real cars - a 1929 Olds woody, a
G-Man Cruiser, a 1955 Packard, the 1958 Chevy in which he met his wife,
Bernadette.</p>
<p>Elmer Duellman, who died in 2019, was the kingpin of pedal cars. And
pedal tractors. And pedal helicopters.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Anyone who looks at this armada of antiques may guess that the little
Elmer Duellman didn't have many toys growing up, and he'd be right.
Although according to Duellman, no one around Fountain City had anything
fancy.</p>
<p>&quot;I bought my first pedal-car in 1971; I'd never seen one before,&quot;
he said. &quot;I thought it was pretty neat, so I bought it. Then I started
buying a couple more, then more than more.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon, he had hundreds of pedal cars and pedal tractors, and he and
Bernadette opened Elmer's Auto &amp; Toy Museum.</p>
<p>Not long after that, a different kind of tourist attraction came to town
in the form of a 55-ton boulder.</p>
<p>It hurtled into the recently redecorated bedroom of Dwight and Maxine
Anderson, just as Maxine had walked out of it. The badly shaken
Andersons quickly sold the house to John and Frances Burt, who opened it
as The Rock in the House.</p>
<p>For years, Frances Burt showed tourists the rogue rock, still hunkered
down in the pink floral bedroom, and, in &quot;Believe It or Not!&quot; style,
told about the woman next door who, in 1901, was killed by a boulder.</p>

<p>&quot;She was crushed in bed, while her blind husband beside her escaped
with barely a scratch,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>Everyone gets a kick out of the Rock. These days, entrance is usually by
honor system; once inside, guests can see the rock and read the
displays.</p>
<p>Fountain City was the first town to be settled along this scenic stretch
and was called Holmes Landing, after a fur trader who set up shop there
in 1839. In 1842, a group of Swiss arrived, making their living cutting
wood for the steamboats going by.</p>
<p>The town grew into three streets, set into the steep bluff, and
eventually was renamed for its many springs.</p>
<p>Today, it's a pleasure to walk its streets, lined by sturdy old brick
buildings still occupied by shops and offices.</p>
<p>On Main Street, the Monarch Tavern and Preservation Hall, built by the
Odd Fellows society in 1894, has its original pressed-tin ceilings,
hand-carved oak bars and German-style beer tables with pockets in the
corner for glasses.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Down the street, the Historical Society Museum occupies an 1867 brick
building.</p>
<p>On the bluff, the treehouse-like Hawks View Cottages &amp; Lodges were the
newest things to be built in a long time. Contractor Brad Nilles, who
grew up across the river in Rollingstone, got to know Fountain City
while he was building them.</p>
<p>&quot;As a renovator, I'm struck by how old and well-preserved the downtown
is,&quot; Brad Nilles says. &quot;It hasn't been tinkered with much, and
that's very rare nowadays.&quot;</p>
<p>In Fountain City, of course, the rare is commonplace.</p>
