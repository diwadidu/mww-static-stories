<h2>After more than 125 years, the architect's first works still seem stunningly original.</h2>

Wright's home and studio draw fans from around the world.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Around Frank Lloyd Wright's old stomping grounds in Oak Park, Ill.,
2014 was a big year.</p>
<p>Of course, every year is a big year at the architect's first home and
studio, which draws crowds of people from around the world even when
it's not celebrating its 125th anniversary.</p>
<p>People come to Oak Park for the sensational stories as well as the
architecture. Wright was notoriously ill-behaved, breaking promises and
scoffing at rules. He was a genius, and he knew it.</p>
<p>As a tourist, you don't need to know anything about architecture to see
exactly how much of a genius he was. Just tour his home and studio, then
look across the street: Suddenly, those prettily painted Queen Annes
look painfully lame.</p>
<p>Wright would have said bourgeois and derivative, which made him not the
most popular man in Oak Park even before he abandoned his wife and six
children to run off with the wife of a client.</p>
<p>Wright was no saint, but his work was divine.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's treated with great reverence in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park,
where Wright built his first home in 1889 with a $5,000 loan from his
employer, Louis Sullivan.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very special place,&quot; said Mark Campbell of the Frank
Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust, at the start of our tour. &quot;This was
Frank Lloyd Wright's first house, and all of the others came after.
This was the No. 1 house that he created for himself.&quot;</p>
<p>Wright expanded the house in 1895 and added the studio in 1898. After he
left in 1909, he redesigned the building to provide rental income for
his family. It fell into disrepair and, in 1974, was turned over to the
National Trust for Historic Preservation. It spent 13 years and $3.5
million to restore it to the appearance of 1909.</p>
<p>Technically, it's Victorian, built in the Shingle style. But it has
diamond-paned casement windows, octagonal bays and a giant gable that
shelters the first floor with a tell-tale long horizontal line.</p>
<p>&quot;Experts say you'll never find a Shingle-style house anywhere in the
country that looks like this one,&quot; said our volunteer guide, Gary
Palese. &quot;He's really starting to break down the Victorian style; he
wants to create something new.&quot;</p>
<p>Inside, he led us from living room to dining room, gleaming with
quarter-sawn oak and the colors of earth and stone.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/a/oakpark_wright_heurtley.jpg" alt="Wright's 1902 Heurtley House." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Wright's 1902 Heurtley House is considered one of his best.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Everywhere, we saw inspired details: friezes and skylight grilles,
painted linen and leaded panes. A children's playroom Wright added in
1895 had almost too many to take in: a barrel-vaulted ceiling,
cantilevered window seats, a loft gallery and a mural inspired by the
Arabian Nights tales.</p>
<p>By the time we got to the studio/drafting room, where a chain harness
holds up a second-floor loft, and the library/office, with its three
levels of octagons, we were overwhelmed by his ideas.</p>
<p>Wright's mind must have been going a mile a minute. He even designed a
series of columns at the entry to his studio, incorporating the tree of
life, the book of knowledge and storks, a sign of wisdom and fertility.</p>
<p>Over lunch in downtown Oak Park, we discussed the nature of genius. Do
nice people ever create great works, or does one have to be a jerk?</p>
<p>Then we returned to pick up an audio tour. The surrounding neighborhood
now is the Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic
District, with 27 buildings designed by Wright.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Our favorite was the 1902 Heurtley House, just down Forest Avenue. It's
full-blown Prairie style, with strong horizontal lines and a hipped
roof, and we envied its owners.</p>
<p>The 1895/1923 Nathan Moore house was across the street, his first
commission in Oak Park after leaving Sullivan. It combines elements of
European cathedral with Tudor, with details that include a fence of
giant concrete acorns.</p>
<p>And on a nearby court, the 1906 Laura Gale house is considered a
&quot;little Fallingwater,&quot; after the masterpiece Wright designed nearly
30 years later in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>We didn't like the audio tour, however. It was impersonal and heavy on
architectural theory, and it rushed us through the district.</p>
<p>Of course, we could have stayed there until the sun went down and still
not seen as much as we wanted. Wright's legacy is too much to absorb in
one day.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Frank Lloyd Wright in Oak Park, Illinois</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/a/oakpark_wright_moore.jpg" alt="Wright's Moore house in Oak Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Wright used elements from European cathedrals in his Nathan G. Moore
House.

<p><strong>Getting there</strong> : Oak Park is 10 miles west of Chicago's Loop. From
there, it's a half-hour ride on the Green Line train to the Oak Park
stop, then an eight-block walk to the Home &amp; Studio.</p>
<p>The district also is just north of I-290, the Eisenhower Expressway.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://flwright.org/">Wright Home and Studio</a></strong> : The <a href="http://www.gowright.org/">Frank Lloyd
Wright Preservation Trust</a> gives daily tours
of Wright's home and studio. On summer weekends, it's wise to reserve
in advance.</p>
<p>Guided walking tours of the Frank Lloyd Wright Historic District are
offered on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p>Self-guided audio tours are available every day, but try to take the
guided tour if at all possible. Narration on the taped tour is rushed
and rather dry, and it's difficult to juggle both the audio device and
a camera.</p>
<p>If necessary, a better option is to buy the Fan Guide set of cards,
which includes photos, commentary and maps and covers more houses.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.architecture.org/">Chicago Architecture Foundation</a>
gives many <a href="https://www.architecture.org/experience-caf/tours/detail/frank-lloyd-wright-in-oak-park/">tours that include Wright
buildings</a>, including Sunday walking tours of Wright-designed buildings in Oak
Park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/a/oakpark_wright_detail.jpg" alt="Stork columns at Wright studio." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
For the entry to his studio, Wright designed panels on which storks, the
symbol of wisdom, flank architectural plans unfurling from the book of
knowledge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It also offers the four-hour Frank Lloyd Wright by Bus and Frank Lloyd
Wright Neighborhoods by Bus. Both leave from the CAF Shop &amp; Tour Center
on Michigan Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>Special tours</strong> : The annual <a href="http://flwright.org/wrightplus">Wright Plus
Housewalk</a>, a tour of buildings in Oak
Park and adjoining River Forest, is held in May and sells out far in
advance.</p>
<p><strong>Other attractions in Oak Park</strong> : The <a href="https://www.hemingwaybirthplace.com/">Ernest Hemingway Birthplace and
Museum</a> are at 339 and 200 N. Oak
Park Ave., not far from the Wright Home &amp; Studio. They're open for
tours.</p>
<p><strong>Visitor information</strong> : <a href="https://www.visitoakpark.com/">Oak Park
tourism</a>, 708-848-1500. The visitor
center is at 1010 Lake St. in the downtown district, which has many
shops and restaurants.</p>
<h3>More Wright in Chicago</h3>
<p>Tours of Wright's 1910 Prairie-style <a href="https://flwright.org/visit/robiehouse">Robie
House</a>, on the campus of the
University of Chicago, are available Thursday through Monday.</p>
<p>In the Loop, short tours of the lobby of the Rookery are given at noon
Monday-Tuesday and Thursday-Friday. The 1888 building was designed by
Daniel Burnham and John Root, but Wright redesigned the interior court
in 1905.</p>
