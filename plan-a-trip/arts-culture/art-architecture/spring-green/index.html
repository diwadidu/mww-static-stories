<h2>Creative urges converge in Frank Lloyd Wright's hometown.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_green_carousel2.jpg" alt="The carousel at House on the Rock." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At over-the-top House on the Rock, the carousel is the biggest eyeful of
all.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's a story behind everything in Spring Green.</p>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright's story begins in the 1860s, when his unconventional
grandparents and their 10 children emigrated from Wales to settle this
dramatic valley of the Wisconsin River, which came to be known as &quot;the
valley of the God-almighty Joneses.&quot;</p>
<p>The story of Alex Jordan's House on the Rock, atop a limestone spire
that overlooks the valley and Wright's beloved home, is rooted in
spite. After his father traveled from Madison to show Wright blueprints
for a rooming house, and was harshly snubbed, Jordan vowed to get even
and &quot;put a Japanese house up out there.&quot;</p>
<p>The founders of the renowned American Players Theatre ended up in Spring
Green after considering 43 other sites. They chose a hillside site near
the river for its superb acoustics, built an amphitheater and staged the
first play in 1980.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They all came to this valley — or, in Wright's case, returned to it
— along with many artists and artisans, who settled amid its wooded
bluffs and ridges.</p>
<p>&quot;We call it the Spring Green vortex,&quot; said manager Michael Anderson
at Taliesin Bookstore at the Frank Lloyd Wright Visitor Center.
&quot;There's something going on here.&quot;</p>
<p>Wright likened the pull of these unglaciated hills to a stretched rubber
band.</p>
<p>Today, it's the tourists who are pulled in.</p>
<p>Visitors come from all over the world to House on the Rock. There's
even a Christmas tour, adding excess to excess:  more than 6,000 Santas,
sitting between wooden soldiers on the booming Gladiator Calliope, being
pulled by mermaids on the 182-chandelier Carousel, surfing next to a
giant whale tail on Heritage of the Seas.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_green_taliesin.jpg" alt="Taliesin in Spring Green." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Craig Jacobsen</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin is considered a masterpiece.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's not exactly festive, but it's a spectacle.</p>
<p>&quot;It's unbelievable,&quot; said visitor Pat Phillips of Cottage Grove,
Minn. &quot;This guy had to have a bolt loose, but he's so creative. I've
never seen anything like this.&quot;</p>
<p>No one really knows what drove Alex Jordan to turn his father's
&quot;Japanese house,&quot; begun in 1946, into a 16-building, over-the-top
collection of stuff.</p>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright, however, was brashly outspoken about his
architectural motivations, reflecting the Lloyd Jones family motto:
&quot;Truth against the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Taliesin is here, the 1911 masterpiece he built for his ill-fated
mistress near a sharp bend in the Wisconsin River that the local Sauk
and Winnebago considered sacred.</p>
<p>There's the Hillside Home School, which he built for his sisters in
1902, and the 1897 Romeo and Juliet Windmill Tower.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's the 1886 family chapel that was Wright's first design job, as
an 18-year-old apprentice; his 1956 schoolhouse; and Taliesin's cow
barn and dairy tower, with a conical spire to &quot;commemorate the Guernsey
teats.&quot;</p>
<p>They're all distinctively Wrightian, with red hipped roofs, rows of
windows to let the outside in and strong horizontal lines, reflecting
the stacked slabs of golden limestone in nearby outcroppings.</p>
<p>&quot;His family had a Unitarian love of nature, and his architecture
reflects the idea that nature is inherently good,&quot; said Taliesin tour
guide Erik Flesch. &quot;He said he could design everything from chicken
coop to cathedral, and everything would be just as beautiful and just as
perfect for its purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>The tours include the family cemetery outside Unity Chapel, where the
epitaph of Wright's strong-willed mother, Anna Lloyd Jones, reads,
&quot;She loved the truth and sought it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She was an intense woman,&quot; Flesch noted.</p>

Wisconsin River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Wright's widow Olgivanna was similarly strong-willed. After Stalin's
daughter Svetlana defected to the United States in 1967, Olgivanna invited her to
Spring Green and arranged her marriage to Wright's apprentice Wes
Peters, the widower of Olgivanna's daughter, also named Svetlana.</p>
<p>Lana Peters lived off and on in and around Spring Green until she died
in 2011. At Taliesen, she said, &quot;Mrs. Wright's word was law.&quot;</p>
<p>Many other kinds of creative folks — painters, potters, woodcarvers,
glass blowers — have set up shop in these hills.</p>
<p>Many Spring Green artists are among the 50 represented at the Wisconsin
Artists Showcase on Washington Street, a former cheese warehouse that
also holds the studio of papermaker Jura Silverman.</p>
<p>On Winsted Street, Gallery Art on 23 carries the work of 25 artists, as
well as the studio of glassblower Colleen Ott.</p>
