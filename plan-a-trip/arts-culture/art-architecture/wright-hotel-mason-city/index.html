<h2>An Iowa town that embraced the famous architect has reopened his last hotel.</h2>

<p>Brilliant men have been very good to Mason City, Iowa.</p>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright built a bank, hotel and house there in 1908-09, and
the locals loved his Prairie style so much it commissioned houses from
four of his associates. Today, it's one of the best collections in the
nation.</p>
<p>Wright became persona non grata in Mason City after he abruptly left for
Europe with his married lover. But a musical virtuoso was growing up
nearby. Meredith Willson's &quot;The Music Man,&quot; inspired by Mason City
and its band, became a Broadway smash in 1957.</p>
<p>By then, there really was trouble in River City. Wright's elegant Park
Inn had been cut into apartments. It became the last Wright hotel in the
world in 1968, but eventually was abandoned.</p>
<p>Finally, local preservationists got to work, and in August, they
reopened the hotel, which makes this town of 28,000 a prime destination
for the legions of Frank Lloyd Wright fans around the world.</p>
<p>It took six years and $18 million. Now called the Historic Park Inn,
the hotel gleams with Wright-designed art glass, sconces, skylights and
polished wood.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>So many people want to get a look that docents give tours on Thursdays,
Fridays and Sundays. They start at the front desk, over which a dropped
ceiling nearly brushes the staff's heads.</p>
<p>It's &quot;so you can appreciate the grandeur as the rooms behind it open
up,&quot; says front-desk clerk Shelley Koren, who said she loves her
front-row perch in Wright's design.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really, really fun for me,&quot; she says. &quot;People come up sharing
stories from years gone by.&quot;</p>
<p>Mason City lawyers James Blythe and James Markley recruited Wright to
design a building that could house their law offices, a bank and a hotel
where their clients could stay; Markley's daughters attended the
boarding school Wright's aunts ran in Spring Green, Wis., which Wright
designed.</p>
<p>Wright completed the design before he abandoned his wife and six
children to go to Europe with Mamah Borthwick Cheney, the wife of a
former client. One of his associates oversaw construction, and the
building opened to acclaim in 1910.</p>
<p>But the bank soon closed, the lawyers moved and retail shops took over
the first floor.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mason_city_inn_skylight.jpg" alt="The Historic Park Inn's Skylight Room." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Wright, who died in 1959, now is considered the greatest architect of
the 20th century. That put a lot of pressure on the non-profit Wright on
the Park foundation, which bought the hotel from the city and undertook
its restoration.</p>
<p>On a Sunday tour, docent Teri Elsbury guided us around the hotel —
&quot;it's a little bit of a maze,&quot; she said &amp;mash; and explained the
hallmarks of the Prairie School: flat, horizontal lines with overhanging
eaves, evoking the prairie landscape, and ocher, sage and russet tones
that echo its colors.</p>
<p>We started in the Skylight Room, where the ceiling rises to 13 feet.
Original art-glass panels, designed by Wright and retrieved from a local
home, bathe guests in light as they drink their morning coffee and read
the paper.</p>
<p>The skylight probably was removed because it leaked, and Elsbury told us
the famous story about the client who called Wright to complain when
water dripped through his ceiling during a dinner party. Wright's
response: &quot;Move your chair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He was a very arrogant man, but he had great vision,&quot; Elsbury said.
&quot;He tended to think the glory of being around him was enough. He was
very charismatic and people loved him, but he wasn't good at repaying
debts; he didn't think it was necessary.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Preservationists had no photos of the hotel interior to work from, so
local designers furnished it with Mission and Stickley reproductions and
designed wool carpets using geometric Wright patterns.</p>
<p>The white-tile floor, despite being cracked and stained in places, was
judged part of the &quot;historical fabric&quot; by the National Register of
Historic Places, and had to stay.</p>
<p>We climbed a narrow stairwell to a small mezzanine &amp;mash; &quot;Wright wasn't
a tall man, so be careful of your head,&quot; Elsbury warned &amp;mash; which
builders reconstructed from Wright's plans.</p>
<p>It features a player piano, two distinctive barrel-shaped chairs,
reproduced from Wright's designs, and another low ceiling: &quot;He liked
tension and drama in a compressed space,&quot; Elsbury said.</p>
<p>The ladies parlor faces the park and an outdoor terrace; designers
outfitted it with upholstered chairs, Arts and Crafts-style prints and a
rug with a tulip design.</p>
<p>The law offices now are a sitting area, lighted by wood-framed cubes
made from Wright's design, and the law library is preserved virtually
intact.</p>

<p>We were lucky enough to see a bedroom, one of eight in which original
paned windows give guests a view of Central Park. They're smallish by
today's standard, but more than double their original size, and
handsomely furnished.</p>
<p>From the upper level, we went down to the cozy gentlemen's billiards
room, furnished with a 1910 pool table with leather pockets, black
leather chairs and a bar that's open to the public.</p>
<p>Walls are lined with enlarged vintage photos, one showing elephants
marching down main street in the 1920s.</p>
<p>&quot;In so many ways, Mason City was quite the metropolis in its day,&quot;
Elsbury said.</p>
<p>There's also a handsome restaurant and a small wine room with exposed
brick, used for tastings and luncheons. In the former bank building, an
airy ballroom has its original skylights and cream-brick walls with
iridescent mortar.</p>
<p>It's a gorgeous place. The preservationists heeded Wright's words:
&quot;If you foolishly ignore beauty, you will soon find yourself without it
. . . but if you invest in beauty, it will remain with you all the days
of your life.&quot;</p>
