<h2>In southeast Wisconsin, a wax magnate's decision to hire 'the greatest architect in the world' had stunning results.</h2>

<p>Wherever he worked, Frank Lloyd Wright was good for a story.</p>
<p>In Racine, Wis., the staff of global manufacturer SC Johnson has plenty
of them to tell.</p>
<p>In 1936, the grandson of the company's founder hired the flamboyant
architect to design an Administration Building. &quot;Don't make it too
unconventional,&quot; H.F. Johnson Jr. told Wright.</p>
<p>So Wright designed a half-acre room with a roof of glass tubing, held up
by concrete flying saucers on spindly legs.</p>
<p>Johnson loved it. So in 1950, Wright gave him a cantilevered Research
Tower, with alternating round and square floors.</p>
<p>Today, hundreds of people join free tours of the complex each week,
trooping through buildings that seem as futuristic today as when they
opened.</p>
<h3>A Wright pilgrimage</h3>
<p>Wisconsin has created a <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/article/tours/wisconsins-frank-lloyd-wright-trail">Frank Lloyd Wright Heritage
Trail</a>, with signs that direct architecture fans from
Racine to Madison and from Spring Green to Richland Center, Wright's
birthplace.</p>
<p>On a cross-state architecture pilgrimage, Racine makes a spectacular
first stop.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I joined one of the Wright tours in the Golden Rondelle theater, a
gleaming gold pod that H.F. Johnson Jr. commissioned as the company
pavilion at the 1964-65 World's Fair.</p>
<p>From there, guide Emily Brzezinski led us past reflecting ponds to the
Administration Building, which we entered through a low carport held up
by the dendriform columns that, inside, soar to 31 feet.</p>
<p>&quot;Wright always wanted to make a dramatic entrance,&quot; she remarked.</p>
<h3>Working with a genius</h3>
<p>The strong-willed Wright lost his first fight with his client. He wanted
to put the company headquarters in the bucolic countryside outside
Racine, and Johnson wanted it in an industrial area near Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>Wright didn't think workers should have to see that view. So instead of
using windows, he flooded the Great Workroom with light from 43 miles of
glass tubing on the ceiling.</p>
<p>The second fight, Wright won. When safety inspectors questioned his plan
to support 12 tons of ceiling with a column that had a 9-inch base, he
put a sample column in a parking lot and heaped it with rocks and rubble
— more and more until a crack finally appeared at 30 tons.</p>

In 1950, the 15-story Research Tower followed the 1939 Administration
Building.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When the rubble was dumped off, it broke a water main 10 feet below
ground level.</p>
<p>Wright's Great Room is warm with natural light and his favorite color,
Cherokee red, found in the brick, rubber flooring, upholstery and metal
of desks and chairs.</p>
<p>Wright designed the furniture, too, including an elegant, three-legged
swivel chair that had a nasty habit of dumping workers who crossed their
legs. He told the workers to get used to it — until he, too, tipped
over. Then he designed a four-legged chair.</p>
<p>It took days to change a lightbulb in the tube ceiling, which, of
course, leaked. So did the roof at Wingspread, the residence on the
north edge of Racine that Wright designed for Johnson at the same time.</p>
<p>When H.F. Johnson called Wright during a dinner party to complain that
rain was dripping on his head, Wright famously replied, &quot;Well, Hib, why
don't you move your chair?&quot;</p>
<p>I asked Brzezinski if H.F. Johnson ever got tired of dealing with
Wright, and she smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they had a kind of father-son relationship,&quot; she said.
&quot;H.F.'s father died when he was a young man, and Wright was his
father's age.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Our next stop was the slender, 15-story Research Tower, supported by a
central core sunk deep into the ground and wrapped with a shell of glass
tubing.</p>
<p>It was horribly drafty and swayed in stiff winds off the lake. The
scientists often had to wear sunglasses and couldn't see each other
around the 13-foot central column. But between 1950 and 1960, they
developed the familiar products Raid, Glade, Pledge and Off!</p>
<p>Today, the building is a time capsule just for visitors, with two floors
of work spaces covered with vintage test tubes, photos, products and
advertising.</p>
<p>In 1982, safety regulators shut the Research Tower down: Only an
elevator and a narrow spiral staircase provided exits to a building that
was full of chemicals and used for open-flame experiments.</p>
<p>Our next stop was Fortaleza Hall, designed by Foster+Partners in 2010
and named for the city in Brazil that H.F. Johnson visited in 1935,
procuring a crucial supply of wax from the leaves of the carnauba palm.</p>
<p>From the hall's glass atrium hangs a replica of the amphibian plane
that Johnson's son Sam used in 1998 to retrace the 1935 expedition,
which his father said &quot;changed my life.&quot; Images of palm trees are
etched onto walls, and a wood mosaic of the route is laid into the
well-waxed floor.</p>

<p>H.F. Johnson Jr. was a bold adventurer who thought big. You had to be to
run a global business, and you had to be to hire Mr. Frank Lloyd
Wright.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Racine and Frank Lloyd Wright</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  Racine is half an hour south of Milwaukee and about an

<p>The theater also shows <a href="http://www.scjohnson.com/en/company/visiting/film_descriptions.aspx">two
films</a>, the one-hour &quot;Carnauba: A Son's Memoir&quot; and the 20-minute &quot;To Be
Alive!&quot; which SC Johnson commissioned for the World's Fair.
Reservations are required.</p>
<p>SC Johnson also offers a free, one-hour
tour of
<a href="https://www.scjohnson.com/Home/Interacting-with-SC-Johnson/Tours-and-Architecture/Our-Architecture/Frank-Lloyd-Wrights-Largest-Prairie-Style-House-Wingspread">Wingspread</a>
<a href="http://scjohnson.com/en/company/architecture/wingspread.aspx">,</a> which
Wright called the &quot;last of the Prairie houses.&quot; The architect
designed it for H.F. Johnson Jr. and his family and completed it in
1939.</p>
<p>The 14,000-square-foot house has four wings and is a National Historic
Landmark. It's five miles north on Four Mile Road, near Wind Point
Lighthouse.</p>
<p><em>More about Wright and the Johnsons:</em> According to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/realestate/commercial/memorializing-a-frank-lloyd-wright-corporate-legacy.html">New York Times
story</a>
published upon the reopening of the Research Tower in 2014, current CEO
Herbert Fisk Johnson III said Wright and his grandfather did indeed have
a &quot;love-hate&quot; relationship.</p>
<p>Though H.F. Jr protested that the Administration Building had been a
&quot;financial and construction nightmare&quot; — it cost nearly half the
net worth of the entire company — he acquiesced to Wright's plans for
the Research Tower, which now is one of only two remaining Wright
high-rises.</p>
