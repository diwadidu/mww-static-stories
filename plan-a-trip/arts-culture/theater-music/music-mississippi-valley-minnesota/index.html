<h2>In southeast Minnesota, an unusual medley of rural and small-town venues draws delighted audiences.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/e/red_wing_sheldon.jpg" alt="The Sheldon Theatre in Red Wing." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Sheldon in Red Wing was the nation's first municipally owned
auditorium.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In southeast Minnesota, along the Mississippi and in its bluffs, folk
and roots music has found a home far from the bright lights of the big
city.</p>
<p>In the countryside, music sounds different. In an old general store in
Oak Center, it's toasty warm, like late-afternoon sunlight.</p>
<p>In the airy loft above a harp-building workshop near Red Wing, it rings
out like a church bell on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>And in Zumbrota, at the smallest Carnegie library in the state, it's
just really, really close.</p>
<p>In Zumbrota, the musicians are so close the owner's dog brushes their
knees when it steps onto the stage to beg for cookie crumbs from the
audience. But the intimacy doesn't deter musicians - on the contrary.</p>
<p>When I was there, all 100 folding chairs were filled for the first
appearance of Peter Ostroushko, the popular fiddler who has performed in
theaters and concert halls across the nation and whose evocative
compositions often are used in television series and played by
orchestras.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;When I saw he was playing here, I thought, 'Oh, my, Zumbrota's
coming up in the world,'&quot; said Karen Brooks of nearby Frontenac.</p>
<p>On the tiny stage at the Crossings in Zumbrota, Ostroushko played fiddle
and mandolin, told stories, traded quips with pianist/accordionist Dan
Chouinard — and had a grand time.</p>
<p>&quot;I love it,&quot; he says. &quot;You're playing right to the faces of the
people, right there in front of you.&quot;</p>
<p>As Ostroushko was performing in Zumbrota, fellow &quot;Prairie Home
Companion&quot; regular Prudence Johnson was with Garrison Keillor in the
western Minnesota town of Morris, singing for a live audience of 2,350
and a broadcast audience of 4 million.</p>
<p>But the next afternoon, Johnson drove down to a little blip on the road
15 miles from Zumbrota, where she and Chouinard played for a delighted
crowd of 85 at the Oak Center General Store.</p>
<p>&quot;It's so unpretentious and so affordable, and it has such a nice
vibe,&quot; she said. &quot;We've always had a lot of fun playing here. It's
warm and receptive, and when people come, they really want to be there,
they really want to hear you.&quot;</p>
<h3>Four unlikely venues</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_city_prudence.jpg" alt="Prudence Johnson and Dan Chouinard." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

concert at the Oak Center General Store.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The slightly scruffy Oak Center General Store near Lake City is one of
four venues that bring a raft of astonishingly good musicians to a small
but scenic part of the state.</p>
<p>From Oak Center, it's just half an hour down bluffs and along the
Mississippi to Red Wing, where the lovely Sheldon Theatre has a
completely different atmosphere — but hosts many of the same
musicians.</p>
<p>Ten minutes outside Red Wing, in a renovated barn on the road to Cannon
Falls, Gary Stone also showcases such favorites as Pat Donohue, Claudia
Schmidt and Ann Reed, who likes to perform a birthday concert there in
December.</p>
<p>Stone, who opened his Hobgoblin Music store in 2001, makes harps,
banjos, mountain dulcimers and Irish bodhrans in the ground-floor
workshop and holds concerts in an all-wood loft. In summer, he holds
bluegrass and folk festivals on an outdoor stage.</p>
<p>&quot;There are more of these music venues than there has ever been before,
which is good, because people need live music,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>From the Music Loft, it's 20 miles down winding County Road 6 to
Zumbrota, just off U.S. 52.</p>

<h3>Tiny but lively in Zumbrota</h3>
<p>Zumbrota is famous for its 1869 covered bridge and now draws many people
to Crossings at the Carnegie, which includes an art gallery, shop and
studio, and to the State Theatre around the corner.</p>
<p>Proprietor Marie Marvin is a Zumbrota native who lived and worked in
Minneapolis and Washington, D.C., before buying the former library
building from a friend.</p>
<p>&quot;Within a year, it had transformed into a gathering space,&quot; she
said. &quot;We've got writing and yoga and Spanish lessons and all kinds of
art classes. It's kind of a magical space, really.&quot;</p>
<p>In the basement clay studio, potters sat over wheels. Upstairs, Mozart
and Beethoven sonatas played as shoppers looked at paintings, bronze
figurines, handmade tiles, art glass and jewelry made by local artists.</p>
<p>Like the gallery, the Crossings' musical calendar grew out of an
appreciation for fine artistry.</p>
<p>&quot;I went to see 'Gales of November' and saw (Peter Ostroushko and Dan
Chouinard) playing, and I thought, 'I have to have them here
together,'&quot; Marvin said.</p>
<p>Just before the evening concert, I nabbed a chair under a window glowing
with paper lanterns.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/z/u/zumbrota_crossings.jpg" alt="Crossings at Carnegie in Zumbrota." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Zumbrota, Crossings at Carnegie hosts folk musicians.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Next to me, Richard and Karen Brooks said they had been to hear Dan
Newton at the Accordion-o-Rama concert the previous week and were
planning to hear Prudence Johnson in Oak Center the next day and Wylie
and the Wild West at the Sheldon in Red Wing the following week.</p>
<p>&quot;We go as often as we can,&quot; Karen Brooks said.</p>
<p>&quot;We lived in Chicago for 30 years and went to a lot of concerts, but
you'd need binoculars for that,&quot; her husband added.</p>
<p>For more than two hours, we listened to Ostroushko and Chouinard weave
tales of rural Ireland pubs and Italian villages with tunes from all
over the world; by the time they wrapped up, our heads were filled with
dreamy images of old Europe, and we all were yearning for a cold
Guinness.</p>
<p>Chouinard's droll jokes led more than one person in the audience to
follow him the next day to his afternoon concert with Prudence Johnson
at the Oak Center General Store.</p>
<p>&quot;We thought, 'Hmmm, that's pretty good — got another one?' &quot; said
Linnae Glestad of nearby Wanamingo.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>A progressive outpost</h3>
<p>Standing almost by itself amid rolling farmland, the Oak Center General
Store is an unlikely music venue.</p>
<p>After former Mayo medical student Steven Schwen bought the abandoned
store in 1976, it again became a store, selling organic produce from the
adjoining farm, but it also became a forum for people committed to peace
and social justice as well as sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a cultural void,&quot; Schwen says. &quot;The whole idea was, we wanted
to create a mini rural university.&quot;</p>
<p>The late U.S. senators Eugene McCarthy and Paul Wellstone were among
those who attended the workshops and discussions.</p>
<p>Schwen has built a loyal roster of musicians, such as Greg Brown, who
comes regularly, despite his agent's objections to the low ticket
prices, and Peter Ostroushko, who calls it &quot;my favorite gig in
Minnesota.&quot;</p>
<p>Before introducing the musicians, Schwen gets up on stage and urges the
audience to work for a better world. When we were there, the stage was
adorned with Valentine's Day balloons and heart-shaped twinkle lights,
and Schwen tailored his message to match.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/z/u/zumbrota_peter_dan.jpg" alt="Dan Chouinard and Peter Ostroushko." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Accordionist Dan Chouinard and fiddler Peter Ostroushko play music and
tell stories at the Crossings at Carnegie in Zumbrota.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;That's what will transform the world, when they can see the love in
our hearts when we stand up for our principles and for people who are a
little less advantaged than us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Relaxed in a pair of jeans and blazer, Prudence Johnson first used
Gershwin and Cole Porter as a showcase for her gold-standard voice, then
joined Dan Chouinard in a goofy comparison of the Italian chestnut &quot;O
Sole Mio&quot; to Elvis' &quot;It's Now or Never&quot; and the sign-off from &quot;The
Jack La Lanne Show.&quot;</p>
<p>It was perfect fare for a Valentine's Sunday. When Johnson and
Chouinard finished, sunlight was still slicing through the curtained
windows, and nobody wanted to go home.</p>
<p>The musical double-header made for a fun weekend. And sometimes, people
who plan ahead can catch a triple-header.</p>
<p>It's an amazing quantity of great music for an area that basically is
farmland.</p>
<p>Ostroushko, who has played at all four venues - at Oak Center, he
makes Schwen pay him partly from his private stock of pickled green
beans-ays musicians can't resist the natural acoustics and
intimate, family-friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p>&quot;All the musicians I know love to play these gigs,&quot; he says. &quot;For
Minnesota to have that many venues clumped in that small a place, only
an hour from the Twin Cities - that's actually pretty remarkable.&quot;</p>
