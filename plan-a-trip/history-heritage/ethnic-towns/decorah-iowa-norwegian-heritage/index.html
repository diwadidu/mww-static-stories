<h2>In northeast Iowa, Decorah still is Norwegian after all these years.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_downtown.jpg" alt="Downtown Decorah." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Decorah's downtown is one of the region's liveliest.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Of all the immigrant groups, Norwegians perhaps are most sentimental.</p>
<p>They settled in hills and valleys reminiscent of their homeland,
bringing trunks full of handcrafted ale bowls and mangle boards.</p>
<p>Generations later, they're still painting bowls and stitching costumes
in the old style and celebrating holidays with foods poor Norwegians ate
in the 19th century.</p>
<p>The heart of this nostalgia is Decorah, a town of 8,500 tucked into the
wooded ridges and limestone bluffs of northeast Iowa.</p>
<p>It's the home of Luther College, established by Norwegians in 1861, and
Vesterheim, founded in 1877 and now the nation's most comprehensive
museum dedicated to a single ethnic group.</p>
<p>Until 1972, it had a Norwegian-language newspaper-the Decorah
Posten, which absorbed the Minneapolis <em>Tidende</em> and Chicago
and Chicago <em>Skandinaven</em> to become the nation's biggest.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Its Nordic Fest in July is one of the region's biggest and best
festivals, drawing 60,000 people for a weekend of Old World immersion
where rosemalers paint, acanthus carvers whittle, fiddlers accompany
folk dancers, Viking re-enactors fashion mail shirts and street stands
sell krumkake, sandbakkels and rosettes, with nary a corn dog in sight.</p>
<p>Tourists from Norway often are surprised by Decorah, commenting that the
locals can seem more Norwegian than they are.</p>
<p>&quot;The young people in Norway are more interested in
pizza-hamburgers-French fries; it's the Norwegian-Americans who are
interested in keeping the traditions alive,&quot; says Diane Weston, a
clerk at Vesterheim. &quot;It starts to hit in their early '30s; they start
realizing it's the thing to do.&quot;</p>
<p>Weston herself is only half Norwegian; her father was English, Scottish
and Irish.</p>
<p>&quot;And those are <em>interesting</em> cultures,&quot; she says. &quot;But this is what I
consider endearing, the Norwegian culture.&quot;</p>
<h3>Lutefisk and ballet</h3>
<p>It's true that few things are cuter than a towheaded toddler in a
wreath of wildflowers, or a young woman clicking heels in an embroidered
<em>bunad,</em> the regional folk costume.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_town_view.jpg" alt="A view of Decorah from the bluffs." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Decorah sits in a bowl, surrounded by bluffs and circled by streams.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The haunting melodies of a hardanger fiddle, the drawn-out vowels of a
Norwegian brogue, the folk-art flourishes on everything — these too
are endearing.</p>
<p>And lutefisk? Yes, even that, or at least the locals' willingness to eat
it. Once a staple for poor Norwegians, lye-soaked cod now is eaten
mainly at Christmas, for tradition's sake.</p>
<p>Despite its allegiance to the 19th century, Decorah always has been a
pretty hip little town. Luther College is a magnet for musicians, whose
concerts and operas often are free or cut-rate.</p>
<p>National ballet and theater troupes also come to town, and the highly
charged cultural atmosphere has attracted artists, who have settled in
the scenic hills nearby.</p>
<p>The tidy brick storefronts of downtown always have been pleasant but
lacked a great place to stay until 2000, when local angel Helen Basler
opened the luxuriously restored Hotel Winneshiek.</p>
<p>The same year, the town's historic homes earned it the title &quot;Prettiest
Painted Place in the Great Plains&quot; from the Paint Quality Institute, as
judged by Better Homes and Gardens, Architecture and Victorian Homes
magazines.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then the town needed only a fine restaurant; it got two, La Rana Bistro
and Rubaiyat Restaurant. The big-city amenities on top of small-town
warmth make locals almost giddy.</p>
<p>&quot;This is just an ideal place, and we get to live here,&quot; says Kari Burns
of the Winneshiek County tourism council. &quot;We don't take it for
granted.&quot;</p>
<p>If these Norwegians weren't so humble, they'd be insufferable. Not that
everyone in Decorah actually is Norwegian.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a proven fact there a few of us Germans here,&quot; jokes Charlotte
Strinmoen, who came to the area from Berlin as a youth. &quot;It really is a
proven fact there are more Germans in the county. But this here is
Norwegian territory — lutefisk and lefse, rah-rah-rah.&quot;</p>
<p>I met Strinmoen when she was walking with her Norwegian husband, Lloyd,
along the paved Trout Run Trail, which follows the Upper Iowa River as
it carves an &quot;S&quot; through town, then veers away to follow Trout Run
Creek.</p>
<p>Overhead, from a stone gazebo in Phelps Park, another trail follows the
wooded bluff top, lined with fanciful pillars of boulders and limestone
slabs stacked like dominos.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_vesterheim_dancers.jpg" alt="During Nordic Fest, dancers gather at Vesterheim." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
During Nordic Fest, dancers and musicians gather on the grounds of
Vesterheim.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On top of everything else, Decorah has an idyllic setting that draws
canoeists, hikers and bicyclists. There's a spectacular view from the
bluff, of course, and others from the hill above Dunning's Springs Park,
famous for its lacy waterfall, and the trails of Palisades Park.</p>
<p>On the quiet riverside road between the two, Decorah's Ice Cave has been
attracting sightseers for a century; in its hillside chambers, ice
appears during spring thaw and lasts until late summer.</p>
<p>Near the fish hatchery, just off Trout Run Trail, the famous Decorah
eagles have raised dozens of young, avidly watched by millions on
<a href="https://www.raptorresource.org/birdcams/decorah-eagles/">webcams</a>.</p>
<p>Decorah's other marquee attraction is Vesterheim, the Norwegian &quot;home in
the west&quot; that attracts visitors from all over the world. It's a
village in itself, with 15 historic buildings, a four-level museum and a
crafts and education center.</p>
<p>It has its own church, its own stone mill and blacksmith shop and its
own celebrations: In May, it marks Syttende Mai, which celebrates the
day in 1814 when Norway ended its long subservience to Denmark and
adopted a democratic constitution.</p>
<h3>A dire prophecy</h3>
<p>In the museum, visitors learn that the number of emigrants who left
Norway between 1825 and 1930 was nearly equal to Norway's 1825
population; only Ireland gave up a greater percentage of its population
to America.</p>
<p>There are voices reading the words of emigrant John Nelson Luraas, an
eldest son due to inherit the family farm but who still foresaw a bleak
future, and Pastor P.A. Jensen, who warned that &quot;. . . Soon will you
forget the speech and custom of your fathers . . . And you will live in
exile always.&quot;</p>
<p>There are the typical contents of an emigrant's trunk, including a
delicate china cup and a wooden mangle board, used to smooth clothing.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_upper_iowa_kayaker.jpg" alt="A kayaker on the Upper Iowa River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Limestone palisades line the Upper Iowa River northwest of town.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There are exhibits on Norwegians who served in the Civil War, naming
their companies &quot;Odin's Rifles&quot; and &quot;Norway Wolf Hunters,&quot; and on the
heroes of Telemark, members of the Norwegian Resistance whose persistent
sabotage prevented Nazi occupiers from producing the heavy water needed
to make an atomic bomb.</p>
<p>Vesterheim anchors one end of Decorah's Water Street, with a lineup of
shops whose apparent health seems miraculous considering a Wal-mart has
sat outside town for many years.</p>
<p>There's a food co-op, a hatchery, a jeweler's, furniture and hardware
stores, three women's clothing shops, two bakeries and a mom-and-pop
J.C. Penney, the only franchise other than Blimpie Subs and Happy Joe's
Pizza Parlor, where a stained-glass &quot;Velkommen&quot; sign hangs over the
counter.</p>
<p>And there are bars, unusually tidy and well-lighted, and a tattoo
parlor, its windows full of plants and a flier advertising a Decorah
Chorale concert.</p>
<p>Spend more than a day walking along Water Street, and you become part of
the town fabric.</p>
<p>I first saw Karen LaBat and Sherri Gahring at La Rana, where I was
savoring a meal of mixed greens with crayfish tails and avocado, fresh
crab cake with truffle-essence mashed potatoes and lemon-curd tart with
fresh raspberries and a chopped-hazelnut topping.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I saw the pair again over breakfast at the Hotel Winneshiek, where we
discussed the two degrees of separation that seem the norm in Decorah.</p>
<p>&quot;We were at Tupy's, and the woman there said, 'Oh, you ladies have been
here awhile,' &quot; said LaBat, associate professor of clothing design at
the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>&quot;She'd seen us walking along the street — typical small town. We said,
'Oh, we're staying at the hotel,' and we had a little restaurant list
from the chamber and were trying to figure out where to go, and she told
us to go to La Rana. That was the assistant, Robin — you leave knowing
everyone's name.&quot;</p>
<p>LaBat had come to Decorah to look at Vesterheim's large collection of
mittens from the Selbu region of Norway and had brought Gahring, an
associate professor of textiles.</p>
<p>On LaBat's advice, I stopped by a Scandinavian imports shop to see Selbu
love mittens, which are two pairs of mittens conjoined in the middle so
those sentimental — and, apparently, romantic — Norwegians can hold
hands.</p>
<p>Up the hill, while admiring the fantastical rock wall of the Porter
House, I ran into Vern Ratcliff.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_vesterheim_fall.jpg" alt="Vesterheim museum in Decorah." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I'd seen him and his wife, Viola, while we were touring Vesterheim and
again over lunch; he and Viola had come from Webster City, Iowa, to
donate Viola's great-grandfather's discharge papers from the Norwegian
navy and application for U.S. citizenship.</p>
<p>It's funny, how wrong that sour old Pastor Jensen was. Not only did the
emigrants not forget the ways of their parents, but they never lived in
exile — in fact, the Norwegians of Decorah have the rest of the world
beating a path to them.</p>
