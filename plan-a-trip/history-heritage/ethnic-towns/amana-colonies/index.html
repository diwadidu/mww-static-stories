<h2>The busiest of Iowa's seven Amana Colonies is both a living historic monument and a shopping destination.</h2>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's obvious from one look at the shop-lined streets of Amana, the
largest of the seven Amana Colonies, that modern commerce is in full
flower there. Even so, the first question asked about the villages is:
Are the Amana people Amish?</p>
<p>And no wonder — the people of the Amanas spoke German, lived simply
and adhered faithfully to Scripture. Many still do. But no, they never
were Amish.</p>
<p>The first people of the Amanas were German immigrants who came to Iowa
in 1855.</p>
<p>They were devoutly religious, as were many of the time, but in addition
they believed in Inspirationism — that God speaks to modern-day people
through chosen <em>Werkzeuge,</em> the German
word for tools, rather than ordained ministers.</p>
<p>The name they gave their Iowa settlement, Amana, comes from the Bible
and means &quot;remain true.&quot;</p>
<p>The Amish — and in fact, the largest community of Amish west of the
Mississippi lives only 30 miles south of the Amanas, around Kalona —
take their name from Jacob Ammann, a bishop born many years before the
Community of True Inspiration was founded in 1714.</p>
<p>The Amish never were communal, but the people of the Amanas were.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>That is, until 1932.</p>
<p>That was the year of the Great Change. A disastrous fire, an exodus of
young people and the Depression's crippling effect on trade led the
villages to drop the communal system to which they had held for nearly a
century.</p>
<p>Today, capitalism flourishes, especially in the town of Amana, lined
with quaint brick storefronts. And yet the church and German traditions
remain, as do the trades in which the workers once pooled their skills.</p>
<p>This expertise — in weaving, woodcrafting, wine-making, basket-making,
cooking — have made a lasting name for the colonies, especially among
tourists.</p>
<p>Now, where kitchen bosses once directed meals made for 10 families,
restaurants serve family-style, setting out heaping platters of smoked
pork chops, roast beef and bowls of corn, mashed potatoes and
sauerkraut.</p>
<p>I often visit Amana on the day after Thanksgiving, which, along with the
day after Christmas, is one of the busiest of the year. There's much to
see. At the Millstream Brewing Co., a brewer stood at the taps, putting
curlicues of froth on small glass mugs of lager, Schild Brau Amber and
wheat beer.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/m/amanas_shoppers3.jpg" alt="Shoppers in the Amana Colonies." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Amana, shoppers roam from shop to shop.

<p>&quot;We follow the old German purity laws,&quot; he said. &quot;Only four
ingredients — hops, malt, yeast and water.&quot; Outside, bushy heads of
hops poked through a weathered wood fence, where a beer garden is
created for summer festivals.</p>
<p>Across the street at the Amana Woolen Mill, the arms and shuttles of a
huge Swiss loom were rising and falling on skeins of black wool.</p>
<p>&quot;They can make a blanket in three minutes,&quot; said a guide for the
Amana Society, which owns the mill. &quot;We used to make our own yarn, but
now we buy it from all over.&quot;</p>
<p>Started in 1857, this is the last woolen mill still operating in Iowa.
Only blankets — Scottish tartans, pastel baby comforters, cotton
thermals — are made.</p>
<p>There are clothes for sale, but these, marked &quot;Made for the Amana
Woolen Mill,&quot; are made elsewhere.</p>
<p>At the Amana Furniture Shop, crowds of people were studying beautiful
cherry armoires, walnut end tables, oak bed frames.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Each craftsman works by himself on a project; it's not a production
line,&quot; said Betty, who wore an Amana Society name tag. &quot;And
all our woods are solid; so many places take mixed woods and stain them
to look solid.&quot;</p>
<p>The workshop is behind big gallery windows in the back, past the
grandfather clocks in what once was the Amana Calico Works.</p>
<p>Amana also is the home of the Amana Heritage Museum, where a video
explains that before the Great Change, everyone in the colonies —
tinsmiths, cobblers, griddle-makers — received store credit in return
for a full day's work and their presence in church.</p>
<p>According to the show, the switch to the profit-sharing Amana Society
corporation, which still runs the mill, furniture shop, meat shop and
many other enterprises, resulted in &quot;a bruised idealism, an injured
faith.&quot;</p>
<p>Many of the people who visit Amana are more interested in shopping than
heritage, however.</p>
<p>Visitors stream in and out of the the Chocolate Haus, Amana Colonies
Bakery &amp; Cafe, the wineries and the Amana General Store, which once sold
such staples as sugar and salt and now stocks upscale gifts.</p>
<p>Fine artists from Iowa and neighboring states have a showcase at
Catiri's Art Oasis, filled with hand-blown glass, oil and pastel
paintings, ceramic pots and jewelry.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/m/amanas_shoppers.jpg" alt="Shoppers in the Amana Colonies." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
With its restaurants and shops, Amana is a favorite day trip for people
around the region.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Tourists, who come by the busload, gravitate to the bakery, the
chocolate store and the quilt shop.</p>
<p>But German traditions flourish. At the Amana Meat Shop, German-speaking
octogenarian Carl Oehl sometimes holds court, handing out samples of
Landjaeger, a dense German sausage, and joking with patrons. Shelves are
filled with imported cookies, candies, honey and other German treats.</p>
<p>Amana restaurants serve sauerbraten, wiener schnitzel and spaetzle.
During Oktoberfest, where Oehl has been the burgermeister, people test
their speed at log-sawing and their strength in Maßkrugstemme (holding
full mugs of beer).</p>
<p>At one of the B&amp;Bs that have sprung up like the dandelions local
wineries still use to make wine, I talked with a local bookkeeper, who
had a distinct German accent. She was born and reared in High Amana, she
said, as were her grown children, though they have only slight accents.</p>
<p>She smiled as she told me that, although some of the shop owners come
from outside the Amana Colonies, most the employees are locals. The
values and traditions of the old colonies, she said, have changed.</p>
<p>But she brightened when I asked about the craftsmanship for which the
villages still are known.</p>
<p>&quot;No, that stays,&quot; she said. &quot;That hasn't changed. That can be
handed down.&quot;</p>
