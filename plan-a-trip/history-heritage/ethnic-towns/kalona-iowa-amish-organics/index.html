<h2>In southeast Iowa, the Amish find common ground with those who value a grassroots lifestyle.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/a/kalona_tractor.jpg" alt="Farm machinery at Kalona Historical Village." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Around Kalona, Iowa, there's one group of people who always have
understood sustainable agriculture and locally sourced food.</p>
<p>For the Amish, that's a lifestyle, not a movement.</p>
<p>Since 1846, Old Order Amish have lived and worked in this bucolic pocket
of southeast Iowa, 20 minutes from Iowa City.</p>
<p>They don't use electricity, natural gas or plumbing. They don't look
in mirrors or wear bright colors.</p>
<p>And yet, each year the Amish look more and more on-trend. They're
naturally green, and the small-batch artisan goods they produce-from
pasture-raised eggs to handmade quilts-are in high demand.</p>
<p>&quot;People love to drive around to all their little country shops,&quot;
says Nancy Roth, who leads tours of Amish and Mennonite farms and
businesses. &quot;It's a fascination for everybody.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The willingness of many people to pay a premium for high-quality or
organic products has provided a much-needed niche for the
enterpreneurial Amish, who can't afford to buy more farmland for their
many sons because developers also want it.</p>
<p>The proximity of Iowa City is a blessing and a curse. Though it's put
pressure on land prices, the college town is a source of the kind of
people who appreciate a grassroots lifestyle.</p>
<p>Not only do they come to buy, they often move to the area. New residents
have started the Kalona SuperNatural brand of organic dairy goods and,
most recently, the Kalona Brewing Company, in an old tractor dealership
downtown.</p>
<p>Kalona is a melting pot of people, from the ultra-pious to the
progressive.</p>
<p>At the rural Community Country Store, women in white muslin prayer caps
and long dresses of navy and dark green share the narrow aisles with the
worldly shoppers who drive in from Iowa City.</p>
<p>For those fascinated by the Amish lifestyle, which rejects vanity and
materialism, a walk through this general store is a lesson in itself.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/a/kalona_downtown.jpg" alt="Downtown Kalona." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Downtown Kalona includes a brewpub and Mexican and Italian restaurants.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Overhead are hooks on which kerosene lamps are hung at dusk. On the
shelves are open boxes of the utilitarian goods found in general stores
a century ago-shoehorns, thimbles, socks-plus baked goods,
wooden toys and bins of flour and other bulk goods.</p>
<p>Prices are low, set to be within reach of the families who work the land
nearby. Around Kalona, it's piety that's important, not profit.</p>
<p>This Amish community is the oldest in Iowa and one of the largest west
of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>Here, the 19th century never faded into history. Or even the 16th
century-the Amish, who believe in a literal interpretation of the
Bible, are direct descendants of the Anabaptists, a Swiss group that
believed Martin Luther and the other leaders of the Protestant
Reformation didn't go far enough in returning the church to Scripture.</p>
<p>Not all of the Amish lead a strictly conservative lifestyle. New Order
Amish can use rubber tires on their horse-drawn buggies, and the Beachy
Amish may drive cars-black ones-and use cell phones.</p>
<p>And even within each Old Order community, the bishop can choose to relax
rules on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Mennonites, who compose perhaps half of the town of 2,400, lead a
relatively modern lifestyle, though many retain conservative values.
They, too, descend from the Anabaptists, and many are the children or
grandchildren of Old Order Amish.</p>
<p>This rich Old World heritage has made a tourist attraction out of
downtown Kalona. People come to gape at the Amish and their buggies and
then duck into antiques and gift shops.</p>
<p>Two dozen shops sell quilts, dried flowers, pottery, fudge, dolls and
various collectibles, though they all close on Sunday for the Sabbath.</p>
<p>Among collectors, Kalona is best-known for its quilts. In April, the
Kalona Quilt Show &amp; Sale draws thousands of people from all over the
country.</p>
<p>Marilyn Woodin started Woodin Wheel, the show sponsor, and her personal
collection of hundreds of quilts made between 1820 to 1940 is stored in
the Kalona Quilt and Textile Museum.</p>
<p>&quot;We're very into helping people see these quilts as American women's
art,&quot; she says.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/a/kalona_grandpa_house.jpg" alt="Buildings at Kalona Historical Village." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>The best way to get to know the Amish and Mennonite culture of Kalona is
by taking one of the tours offered by the Kalona Historical Society.</p>
<p>The first half-hour, over coffee and doughnuts, is devoted to
straightening out the difference between Amish and Mennonites.</p>
<p>Usually, someone will ask where the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/amana-colonies/">Amana
Colonies</a>, 30 miles to the
north, figure in.</p>
<p>They don't-though the people of the Amanas also are German-speaking
religious separatists, they're offshoots of Lutherans and had a
communal lifestyle until they abandoned it in 1932.</p>
<p>Though the Amish cooperate with each other, they've never been
communal.</p>
<p>The tour continues with demonstrations, such as rug-weaving or
cheese-making, and a meal in an Amish/Mennonite home, where organic
meats, egg noodles, tapioca pudding and apple butter are specialties.</p>
<p>There's a visit to the Kalona Historical Village, an open-air museum of
13 buildings that includes an 1897 country store, a schoolhouse, a post
office and the 1879 railroad depot around which the downtown grew.</p>
<p>The Iowa Mennonite Museum at the village is Kalona's heirloom attic.
Old tin toys, milk-glass dishes and 150-year-old quilts are labeled with
family names; Yoder and Miller are so common the postmaster can't
deliver mail without a middle name.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/a/kalona_pretzel_stand.jpg" alt="Pretzel stand at Kalona Historical Village." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In another corner is an 1881 treadmill, on which dogs or goats ran to
pump water or separate milk. The treadmill, along with an outdoor bread
oven and other antique equipment, is pressed into service once a year,
at the Kalona Fall Festival.</p>
<p>That's the town's biggest event, with food a major draw: homemade ice
cream, soft pretzels, cinnamon rolls, ribs on a stick, biscuits and
gravy and chocolate-chip cookies with milk.</p>
<p>Like most everything else made in Kalona, it's delicious, down-home and
good for you.</p>
