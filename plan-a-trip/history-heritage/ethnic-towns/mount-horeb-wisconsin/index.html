<h2>A little town near Madison wins friends with a mix of old and new attractions.</h2>

<p>In Mount Horeb, Wis., trolls are revered, not reviled.</p>
<p>The little town west of Madison calls itself the Troll Capital of the
World, for its many mascots-most wooden, but one live-and Norse
traditions.</p>
<p>It doesn't have the medieval Norwegian stave church that has been the
town's pride and joy since 1937. The ornate wooden building has gone
back to Orkdal, Norway, whose residents built it for the 1893 Columbian
Exposition in Chicago and will reassemble it as an attraction for
Orkdal.</p>
<p>Many of the original trolls also have retreated, having turned black
with age. But new ones are appearing, along with new wineries, galleries
and artisan farms.</p>
<p>Today, Mount Horeb is a 21st century town for 21st century tastes.</p>
<p>Little Norway, the picturesque open-air heritage museum that included a
replica stavkirke from Norway, has closed. But it's not the only
attraction that has made Mount Horeb, just half an hour from Madison, a
favorite getaway.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The 40-mile Military Ridge State Trail goes through town, connecting the
Madison suburb of Fitchburg to Dodgeville. Just west of Mount Horeb, it
skirts Blue Mound State Park, a magnet for its observation towers and
swimming pool.</p>
<p>The bike trail uses a former rail corridor and is fairly flat. But Blue
Mound is the highest point in southern Wisconsin, on the edge of the
Driftless Area.</p>
<p>The country roads south of the park would have been the cycling course
for the 2016 Olympics, if Chicago had won its bid.</p>
<p>Bicyclists tear up and down them every June on the Horribly Hilly
Hundreds bike tour, &quot;the toughest one-day challenge ride in the
Midwest.&quot; Despite the difficulty-it's been called a
&quot;sufferfest&quot;-it's so popular that it fills by lottery.</p>
<p>The tiny village of Blue Mounds was the first settlement in Dane County,
and in 1939, descendants of its first settler made an astonishing find:
caverns cut by underground streams.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/o/mount_horeb_downtown.jpg" alt="Storefronts in Mount Horeb." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Main Street, shops and galleries occupy century-old buildings.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Today, Cave of the Mounds is open every day, taking visitors through
winding passageways to see fanciful stalactites and stalagmites,
including 17-foot Onyx Ridge, on which ancient rivulets created the
veiled-lady effect used by marble sculptors.</p>
<p>Artisan dairies, orchards and farms also are tucked into the valleys
around Mount Horeb and Blue Mounds, supplying farm-to-table restaurants
and weekly food baskets, or CSA shares, to people in Madison.</p>
<p>South of town, Campo di Bella raises heritage pigs and lamb and grows
grapes for its own wine, which it serves at the farm-to-table dinners it
hosts throughout the year. Its wine bar is open on weekends so visitors
can sample them with Italian appetizers.</p>
<p>Along Main Street, Mount Horeb's brick storefronts are filled with
shops and galleries. Bistro 101 is in a 1916 mercantile building.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Sjölinds Chocolate House is a treasure trove of European goodness, all
homemade: chocolate-dipped Lebkuchen, the German gingerbread; Finnish
pies, filled with beef and vegetables; French macarons; rusk, the
Norwegian biscotti; and Swedish potato sausage and meatballs, served
with limpa bread and lingonberries.</p>
<p>Artisan Woods Gallery occupies the 1898 opera house, and owner Guy
Gibson says he tripled his business when he moved from Madison. His most
popular item now are lightweight clasp purses made of exotic woods.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a great place to be,&quot; he says. &quot;We get people from all over
the country.&quot;</p>
<p>The best-known stops in Mount Horeb have been around for a while. Grumpy
Troll Brewpub, housed in a 1916 creamery on a side street, was in the
vanguard of the craft-beer movement when it opened in 1998. It's still
packed every night.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/o/mount_horeb_little_norway2.jpg" alt="The Little Norway stavkirke near Mount Horeb." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Mount Horeb's stave church, built for the Norwegian exhibit at the 1893
World Expo in Chicago, has been returned to Orkdal, Norway, where it is
used as a venue for weddings and events.

<p>And Open House Imports, selling fine Scandinavian imports out of a
Victorian house since 1966, still is delighting visitors.</p>
<p>One day in fall, Kathy Tapken of Creston, Iowa, was combing through its
maze of rooms.</p>
<p>&quot;I've never seen so many trolls in my life,&quot; she said, as she bought
two indoor trolls to add to her yard gnomes. At Olson's Christmas House
next door, she bought an Irish Santa figure.</p>
<p>&quot;We love these old towns, where you can poke around at your own
speed,&quot; said her husband, John.</p>
<p>It was Open House that put the first trolls on its lawn in 1976. Now it
also has a stabbur, a replica of the raised, top-heavy wooden
storehouses built in Norway since the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Once, the whole town got together to stage Edvard Grieg's operetta
&quot;Song of Norway,&quot; said Carol Johnson of the welcome center. But it
&quot;took up everybody's summer,&quot; she said, and no one has that kind of
time any more.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But there are still plenty of folks who appreciate Norwegian traditions.
They learn rosemaling, the distinctive Norwegian painting style, or they
take one of the Norwegian baking classes offered by the Sons of Norway.</p>
<p>And at festivals-Scandihoovian Fest in winter and Thirsty Troll beer
fest and Heritage fest in fall-they love to pose with the real-life
Jorgen the Troll.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a long time since we had many Norwegians in town,&quot;
Johnson said. &quot;But that's still our heritage.&quot;</p>
