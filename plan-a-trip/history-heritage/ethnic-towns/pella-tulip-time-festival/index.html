<h2>In central Iowa, the Dutch celebrate colorful origins.</h2>

Dancers perform during Tulip Time.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Even in a region rich in ethnicity, the Dutch stand out.</p>
<p>In a town square in Iowa, lacy white hats shaped like pyramids, horns
and half-moons bob high atop women's heads. Men wear black caps,
breeches or baggy trousers and narrow bands cross at their throats.
Their wooden shoes click and clack as they dance.</p>
<p>&quot;These are the weirdest people I've ever seen!&quot; shrieked a little
boy watching from the sidelines.</p>
<p>But the Dutch Family Singers aren't a bit unusual in Pella, where
descendants of the town's early settlers pay homage to their forebears,
especially during Tulip Time in May.</p>
<p>Rosemary Salzman, of Wild Rose, Wis., had come to the festival dressed
like a matron from North Brabant, the Dutch province from which her
grandmother came.</p>
<p>She'd worked four months on the flowing black dress and white <em>poeffer</em>,
a bulky lace hat that flops over the
ears like bicycle panniers and is tied over a bonnet.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;I can't wait to send the pictures to Dad,&quot; she said with a giggle.
&quot;He'll die, he'll love it so much; I'll look like his ma.&quot;</p>
<p>During Tulip Time, the central Iowa town of Pella shows off the greatest
hits of Dutch culture, with acres of tulips, yards of lace and as many
chocolates, cheeses and almond Dutch letters as anyone can eat.</p>
<p>Dancers in wooden shoes entertain the crowd, and the Tulip Queen and her
court parade down a Franklin Street newly cleaned by costumed scrubbers
with wooden buckets and brushes.</p>
<p>It would've been a bit much for the first residents, who came to Pella
in 1847 because they thought the state church in Holland too lax, too
modern and theologically unsound.</p>
<p>A somber group, they once complained to the town's founder, Dominie, or
Reverend, Hendrik Pieter Scholte, that his wife was too beautiful and
too elegant to be a pastor's wife.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/e/pella_street_tulips.jpg" alt="Franklin Street in Pella." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The parade route on Franklin Street is lined with late-blooming tulips
for the festival.

<p>Even Sinter Klaas, the Dutch Santa, was suspect. But the bearded Sinter
Klaas appears at Tulip Time with his galleon and his horse, which he
rides across the rooftops each December.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not part of the town tradition; it's just part of this
event,&quot; said Jay deYoung, who was wearing Sinter Klaas' tall red
miter. &quot;This town was so Calvinistic, they thought gift-giving was
sinful. But over 150 years, they've lightened up.&quot;</p>
<p>With more than 100,000 tourists coming each year, the town has to show
some sparkle. Gardeners plant 80,000 tulip bulbs each fall. Residents
spend months sewing costumes, each representing a different province in
Holland. Candy makers pour and wrap chocolate tulips.</p>
<p>Bakers twist thousands of Dutch letters, an almond-filled puff pastry
that's most often S-shaped. In the bakery of the Pella Historical
Village, Durl Schletzbaum alone makes 960.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to cool the dough four times,&quot; he said, rolling and
buttering the letters. &quot;It's a lot of work.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>So when the tourists come, they're properly dazzled. In the gardens of
the Scholte home, people from all over the world pose with &quot;The
Gardener,&quot; in which a bronze boy presents a mother and her shy
daughter with a bundle of tulips.</p>
<p>Inside the 22-room house, which has been a tourist attraction ever since
it was finished in 1848, they see the iron chest that carried enough
gold to buy 18,000 acres.</p>
<p>In the Dominie's study — he spoke four languages and named the town
for a Jordanian town mentioned in the Old Testament as a &quot;city of
refuge&quot;— there's the original town plat, showing avenues named
Perseverance, Reformation, Gratitude and Patience.</p>
<p>In the drawing room, there's one Delft plate, all that remained of
Mareah Scholte's dishes after the voyage from Holland; the fragments
were used to make a little path between the house and the log cabin in
which they first lived.</p>
<p>Her piano also is in the room, and her art.</p>
<p>Mareah, educated in Paris, never took to pioneer life; among her last
words were, &quot;I am dying a stranger in a strange land.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/e/pella_tulip_sculpture.jpg" alt="Sculpture in Pella." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>The peasant culture is represented everywhere else. In a workshop at the
Pella Historical Village, guest shoemaker Lute van de Bult was shaping
wooden shoes, or <em>Klompen</em>, which he
still wears around his home in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>&quot;When I wear them in the city,&quot; he said, &quot;people look at me —
'What is he doing?' But in my village, it is no problem.&quot; The
shoes, made because people couldn't afford leather, now are worn mostly
in the garden, he added.</p>
<p>The historical village is an utterly charming theme park of folk life.
Brick paths lined with tulip beds connect the 21 buildings, among them a
working smithy, a working grist mill and the boyhood home of Wyatt Earp.</p>
<p>Brightly painted carts are parked on the grass, each selling something
different — <em>Bloemen</em>, <em>Worstjes</em>, <em>Melk</em>.</p>
<p>Costumed &quot;vendors&quot; wheel them out daily to join the parades, one in
the afternoon and one at night.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On the streets, there are long lines for the Kiwanis' <em>poffertjes</em>,
or &quot;small hats,&quot; pancakes served
with hot butter and powdered sugar. On the brick <em>Klokkenspel</em>,
eight 4-foot figures, including Mareah
and Dominie Scholte, twirl to the bells of a carillon.</p>
<p>On a side street, Sinter Klaas is getting his photo taken with Japanese
tourists. &quot;Don't forget to be good, or you'll get rocks in your
shoe,&quot; he calls.</p>
<p>There's a windmill downtown, in Central Park, and another three blocks
away, in Sunken Gardens Park. In West Market Park, there's a daily
re-enactment of a Dutch cheese market during Tulip Time.</p>
<p>There's even a canal, with lampposts and a drawbridge. It's part of
the Molengracht — in Dutch, mill canal — a brick complex of shops,
condos and hotel.</p>
<p>That's a whole lot of Dutchness for a town of only 10,000.</p>
<p>Today, Pella is a prosperous town with two world-class manufacturing
firms, Pella and Vermeer, and it doesn't particularly need tourism. The
trademarks of the old culture — the shoes made of wood, the dresses
dyed black so they wouldn't show dirt — haven't been needed for a
long time.</p>

<p>Even so, it's a heritage much too colorful to give up.</p>
