<p>On a single day in Winnipeg, a tourist can learn a few words of Cree,
dine on curry and conch, and come face to face with Queen Victoria.</p>
<p>The empire on which the sun never sets has come to the Canadian prairie,
and so have a whole lot of other countries.</p>
<p>The Cree and Assiniboine-Aboriginals, they're called here-came
first. Then a French explorer arrived at the juncture of the Red and
Assiniboine rivers, and a Scottish lord brought in Scottish and Irish
settlers.</p>
<p>In the 1870s and 1880s, immigrants from Eastern Europe poured in,
followed in the next century by Asians, East Indians and Caribs.</p>
<p>French is as visible as English; it's printed on every cereal box,
handbill and street sign. There are bilingual Ukrainian schools as well
as French ones, and Hebrew is taught as well as Spanish and German.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is the place to find great ethnic cuisine.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The gelati is the best outside New York or San Francisco and is scooped
by Italians who made it themselves. Pierogies are sauteed in butter and
served with horseradish-laced sour cream; Ukrainian has no word for
&quot;low-fat.&quot;</p>
<p>In short, they're the real thing.</p>
<p>&quot;In Canada, it's very important to the ethnic groups to not lose their
identities,&quot; says Sylvia Todaschuk, who runs a Ukrainian gift shop and
is on the board of the ethnic festival Folklorama. &quot;Canada is not a
melting pot; that's an American term. You'll never hear 'melting pot'
from a Canadian.&quot;</p>
<p>In July, the renowned Winnipeg Folk Festival brings in musicians from
around the world. In August, Folklorama taps local citizenry for one of
the biggest ethnic festivals in North America.</p>
<p>Over two weeks, 20,000 volunteers from 45 ethnic groups dance, sing,
demonstrate crafts and prepare the specialties of their countries at
pavilions all over the city.</p>
<p>But the city's polyglot character can be seen any time of the year.
Todaschuk says all 45 cultures-Korean, Filipino, Hungarian,
Paraguayan, Belgian, Portuguese, Aboriginal-are represented on the
eight-block stretch of Selkirk Avenue around her shop, the starting
point of walking tours.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/winnipeg_st_boniface.jpg" alt="A walking tour at Winnipeg's St. Boniface Cathedral." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Walking tours of St. Boniface Cathedral are popular in summer.

<p>&quot;We're a very huge ethnic city,&quot; she says. &quot;For a small city, we're not
lacking for anything.&quot;</p>
<p>The French, who had their foot in the door first, are most ferocious
about keeping their culture. They have a platform in the theatrical
walking tour &quot;In Riel's Footsteps,&quot; held in the cemetery of St.
Boniface Cathedral, in the French quarter.</p>
<p>Offered regularly in summer, it brings French-speaking heroes to life
-especially the still-controversial Louis Riel, who championed the
rights of the original French-Aboriginal residents and is known as the
father of Manitoba.</p>
<p>&quot;Louis Riel was a proud leader of the Metis,&quot; an actress portraying
teacher Angelique Nolin proclaims. &quot;If it weren't for him, there
wouldn't be any Francophones left in Manitoba.&quot;</p>
<p>St. Boniface Cathedral, with stone ruins framing a newer church, is just
across the Red River from the Forks National Historic Site, the
rendezvous point for Winnipeggers.</p>
<p>This is the spot to which Pierre de la Verendrye walked in 1737 and
built a small fur post; it was a run-down rail terminal until 1989, when
shops and a European-style market opened in the old rail buildings.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Now, the Forks is the city's hub in summer, when locals waste no time
making up for the long, raw winters. Performers set up at &quot;busk stops,&quot;
water taxis troll the river and people stroll along shaded walkways.</p>
<p>From the Explore Manitoba Centre, Parks Canada sends out costumed
interpreters who talk about early days, when life turned, often
tragically, on decisions made by Hudson Bay and government officials far
to the east.</p>
<p>But winter also exacted a price. In the 1870s and 1880s, when immigrants
had just arrived to work the land, temperatures sank to record lows that
still stand.</p>
<p>&quot;They went through unbelievable hardships while trying to survive,&quot;
said guide Everett Olson on a &quot;Beaver Tales and River Trails&quot; walk.</p>
<p>Assiniboine Park, just beyond Little Italy along Corydon Avenue, is
another summer hub. Free concerts are held in the Leo Mol Sculpture
Garden and at the Lyric Theatre bandshell.</p>
<p>Bicycle paths weave around the imposing, 1930 Tudor-style Pavilion, a
zoo, a golf course, a conservatory and the English Gardens, ruled by a
stone Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>On the hottest days, the crowds head north, to the long, white-sand
beaches on vast Lake Winnipeg, the sixth-largest lake in Canada, and to
Lake Manitoba, to the west.</p>
<p>Life is much cushier around Winnipeg these days. And for visitors from
the United States, it's a quick way to circle the globe without getting
on a plane.</p>
