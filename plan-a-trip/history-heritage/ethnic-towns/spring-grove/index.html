<h2>Old World traditions come with a wink in the bluff-country burg of Spring Grove.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_grove_float.jpg" alt="A Viking ship float in Spring Grove." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>At first, the southeast Minnesota town of Spring Grove looks like any
other town.</p>
<p>There's a café, an antiques store and a park full of statues. But Spring
Grove isn't ordinary. It's full of Norwegians.</p>
<p>In the park, two bronze men appear to be squabbling; they're characters
in a nationally syndicated comic strip written by a Spring Grove man 50
years before Neil Simon came up with &quot;The Odd Couple.&quot;</p>
<p>Across from the park, there's a goofy concrete troll with a &quot;Belly by
Budweiser&quot; banner draped across its bulbous brown stomach. Tovar the
Terrible, a 12-foot Viking, wields a bright-blue shield nearby.</p>
<p>Spend a few hours in Spring Grove, Minnesota's first Norwegian
settlement, and you'll learn that, while Norwegians are proud of their
heritage, they also like to poke fun at it. A plaque at the Ballard
House antiques shop sums up the approach:</p>
<p>&quot;O Lutefisk, how fragrant your aroma. O Lutefisk, you put me in a coma.
You smell so strong, you look like glue, you taste yust like an
overshoe. But Lutefisk, come Saturday, I tink I'll eat you anyway.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They love their rømmegrøt, a butter-soaked cream pudding that should be
called heart-attack-in-a-cup.</p>
<p>But they've also given the world Spring Grove Soda Pop, made with cane
sugar and in bottles, just as it has been since 1895, and in flavors
that now would be called gourmet-cream, strawberry, orange, root
beer, grape, black cherry and lemon sour.</p>
<p>Norwegians don't waver once they make up their mind. They're world-class
stubborn, so stubborn it has landed them in the Guinness Book of World
Records.</p>
<p>When we were in Spring Grove one May, we stopped into the Bluff Country
Artists Gallery. All those long winter nights made Norwegians good with
chisels, paintbrushes and knitting needles, and the gallery features
works from dozens of artists who work in the area.</p>
<p>Karen Gray was behind the counter, one of the non-artists who volunteer
there.</p>
<p>&quot;We want the artists in their studios, making art,&quot; she said. &quot; I think
the topography here attracts artistic types. It's a getaway place,
quiet, so they can practice their art.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_grove_viking_park.jpg" alt="The Viking in Spring Grove's park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the next room, woodcarver Harvey Langseth was demonstrating on a
mangle board. Nearby, he'd posted a portrait of his Norwegian-born
great-grandfather Hans, who had a 17½-foot beard that still holds the
record for the world's longest and now is owned by the Smithsonian.</p>
<p>&quot;His wife died at age 40, and he vowed never to cut his beard again,&quot;
Langseth said. &quot;He carried it in a dishtowel tied around his neck and
very carefully tucked it into his shirt. People thought he had a
potbelly.&quot;</p>
<p>Among Norwegians, he said, such obstinacy is called leather-headed: &quot;Oh,
I used to hear that all the time, 'You're a leather-headed Norwegian.'
&quot;</p>
<p>The iron-shaped mangle board, he said, is decorative but also has a
practical use: It's made by a young man and handed to the woman he wants
to marry in lieu of a proposal.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an easy way for her to reject him, because it's not me, but the
board,&quot; Langseth said. &quot;She can say, 'No, I don't think I want that
board.' So we save face all around.&quot;</p>
<p>He added, &quot;Beware of a man who has a lot of these lying around his
shed.&quot;</p>
<p>We were in Spring Grove on Syttende Mai, or May 17, the day in 1814 when
Norway declared independence from Denmark and adopted a democratic
constitution.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>To celebrate, the gallery had put out a spread of rosette cookies,
heart-shaped waffles with lingonberry spread and rye crackers with
salmon, so we sampled and then went outside to watch the big parade.</p>
<p>On Main Street, the locals rolled by in a Viking boat with a
red-and-white striped sail. Polka dancers from La Crosse's Oktoberfest
marched by, hoisting steins and blowing horns, and princesses from La
Crescent rode an apple float.</p>
<p>The emcee stood in the balcony of the log Syttende Mai Hus, commenting
on the entries. Everyone waved Norwegian flags.</p>
<p>The Norwegians loved the high ridges and flat-bottomed valleys of
southeast Minnesota, part of the Driftless Area that includes northeast
Iowa and southwest Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Just across the border in Iowa,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/decorah-iowa-norwegian-heritage/">Decorah</a>
also celebrates Syttende Mai. So does
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/vernon-county-wisconsin/">Westby</a>, in the coulees
southeast of La Crosse.</p>
<p>After the parade, we went into the Fest Building for lunch, piling our
plates with rolle polse and varma polse-meatballs on lefse and dried
beef on a roll-and krumkake, the dainty Scandinavian rolled cookie.</p>

<p>At the end of the line, we took cups filled with rømmegrøt, a porridge
made of flour, butter, sugar and cream, but hesitated when one of the
servers encouraged us to top it with more sugar, more butter and
cinnamon.</p>
<p>&quot;Go ahead, put it in, everybody will wait,&quot; she said. &quot;When you live in
a cold climate, you have to put on some fat.&quot;</p>
<p>At our table, I reconnected with Howard Burtness, a native of Spring
Grove and proud Norwegian whom I'd met on another trip.</p>
<p>He had just returned from his winter home in California and told of
spotting a particularly lovely woman on the street who, sure enough,
turned out to be Norwegian.</p>
<p>&quot;Norwegians are the most beautiful people in the world,&quot; he said.
&quot;That's not a boast, that's just a factoid.&quot;</p>
<p>When we left, the server asked how we'd liked the rich rømmegrøt and
advised us to keep moving: &quot;Just a little walk around the town, and
you'll be good,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In Viking Memorial Park, two men, one wearing overalls and one in a
black derby hat and long coattails, were posing for pictures with two
bronze figures dressed the same way.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Between 1918 and 1935, Spring Grove resident Peter Rosendahl wrote the
comic strip <a href="http://oaks.nvg.org/noam2.html">&quot;Ola and Per&quot;</a> for the
Norwegian-language Decorah-Posten, and the strips also ran in Seattle
and Minneapolis.</p>
<p>&quot;Ola looks for the easy way out of things, and I work hard,&quot; said James
Wilhelmson of Spring Grove, who plays Per opposite Norris Storlie of
Harmony. &quot;I'm supposed to be the smart one.&quot;</p>
<p>The two characters bumbled their way through countless misadventures.
Wrote Rosendahl in 1926: &quot;The roles they play in our Western Home out
here/Are meant to ease and lighten the burden that you bear/For most of
us can see when everything goes wrong/A little fun and foolishness make
it easier to get along.&quot;</p>
<p>Apparently, those long winter nights honed the Norwegian sense of humor,
along with painstaking artistry and a love for stories.</p>
<p>Their food may be the blandest in the world. But the Norwegians
themselves? Definitely not.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Spring Grove, Minnesota</h3>

<p><em>A scenic drive:</em>  The 12-mile drive to the Iowa town of Dorchester is
one of the loveliest in the Upper Midwest. Follow County Road 16 along a
