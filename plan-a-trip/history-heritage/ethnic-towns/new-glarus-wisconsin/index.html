<h2>In Wisconsin's Little Switzerland, New Glarus hangs onto a colorful heritage.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_glarus_downtown.jpg" alt="Downtown in New Glarus." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The bakery, chocolate shop and Swiss restaurants are all on

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In a verdant little glen in southwest Wisconsin, the 13th century makes
a reprise appearance every year.</p>
<p>It comes with pageantry, bloodshed and a whole lot of noble sentiments,
courtesy of the 18th-century dramatist Friedrich Schiller. It also comes
in German that's as meaty as the Landjaeger sausages sold to spectators.</p>
<p>As I arrived during the first act of &quot;Wilhelm Tell,&quot; a rich Swiss
patriot was discussing the horrors of war with his wife.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Furchtbar schlecht ist der Krieg!</em>&quot;
he cries, to which Gertrud replies, &quot;<em>Den Brand warf ich hinein mit
eigner Hand!</em>&quot; — &quot;I'll throw the first torch myself!&quot;</p>
<p>Seven hundred years later, the Swiss struggle for independence from
Austria still resonates in the town of New Glarus, founded in 1845 by
108 desperately poor colonists from the Swiss canton of Glarus.</p>
<p>They had been weavers, but they learned to farm and make cheese amid the
rolling hills of Wisconsin, and soon they prospered.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>By 1938, German still was the first language of most residents, but they
could see their culture eroding.</p>
<p>That's when the town of 2,000 started open-air German and English
performances of the famous play, in which the legendary hero Tell is
forced to shoot an apple from his son's head.</p>
<p>Residents also began building houses and shops with half-timbered Alpine
facades and Germanic platitudes unfurling across the plaster in Gothic
script.</p>
<p>They added Swiss canton flags, and window boxes overflowing with
geraniums and, in 1965, annual performances of &quot;Heidi.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, the sign over the fire department reads &quot;Feuerwehrhaus.&quot;
Railroad Street also is &quot;Bahnhofstrasse.&quot;</p>
<p>It's as Swiss as Swiss can be in 21st-century America. Yet the
springerli and marzipan fruits sold at the New Glarus Bakery, the husky
notes from a 6-foot alpenhorn, the 1913 murals of Napoleonic scenes at
the tavern — they're not just for tourists.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_glarus_bike.jpg" alt="The bike depot in New Glarus." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The old train depot is the trailhead of the Sugar River State Trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>However, even the tourists often are Swiss.</p>
<p>When I was having dinner at the 1853 New Glarus Hotel, a classic
gasthaus with dirndl-clad waitresses, 50 Swiss tourists were there,
too.</p>
<p>They'd finished their rahmschnitzel and raclette and were happily
settling in for an evening of singing to folk tunes played by the
accordion-toting Swiss entertainer they'd brought along.</p>
<p>But one of the other attractions of New Glarus isn't Swiss at all. The
town is at one end of the 23-mile Sugar River State Trail, a
crushed-limestone bicycle path that's groomed for cross-country skiing
in winter.</p>
<p>I caught a ride to the other end with a retired milk deliveryman who
spoke nostalgically about the heyday of the cheese factories. Once,
there were more than 200 in this area, called Little Switzerland.</p>
<p>Many supplied the mail-order firm Swiss Colony, which was founded 15
miles to the south in Monroe, still the cheese-making capital of
Wisconsin.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The Sugar River turned out to be more of a creek, and a tortuously
winding one. The path was scenic, though, lined with wildflowers, bogs
and views of pastoral little dairy farms.</p>
<p>Near Albany, a 50-strong contingent of bicyclists streamed onto the path
from a family farm, wearing pink T-shirts that read &quot;Hill Family Labor
Day Fun. Meet You at Puempels Olde Tavern.&quot;</p>
<p>They were already in a festive mood, anticipating a cold glass of beer
from the New Glarus Brewing Co.</p>
<p>We passed the depot in Monticello, where the east-west Sugar River trail
intersects with the north-south Badger State Trail. There was a cool
stretch in the shadow of 50-foot limestone bluffs, and then we cut
through a golf course on our way to New Glarus.</p>
<p>From its depot, I rode up a murderous hill to the Wilhelm Tell Grounds,
where I borrowed a German-language script from a young German teacher
who'd brought his high-school students up from Iowa.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_glarus_ruins.jpg" alt="Picnic area of New Glarus Brewing." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>He was marveling at the quality of the acting and by the Swiss dialect
spoken by some of the actors.</p>
<p>&quot;Swiss has a lilt, that da-DA-da-da,&quot; said Aaron Bicknese of West
Union, Iowa. &quot;And they really roll the r's; listen to how they say
'mirrrrr.' &quot; The actor playing the vile Gessler, however, was using
High German, full of Teutonic bluster.</p>
<p>&quot;My speech sounds higher-class, which makes me a good tyrant,&quot; said
Peter Etter, New Glarus' German-born high-school principal, after the
play.</p>
<p>Back in town, I loaded up on Linzer bars and nut horns at the New Glarus
Bakery. Then I joined the party at Puempels, an 1893 tavern with dollar
bills stuck all over its 18-foot ceiling.</p>
<p>I caught the end of an elbow-pumping, hip-waggling Chicken Dance, then
listened to an Illinois polka band work its magic, or whatever it was,
with an accordion, washboard, tambourine and string bass.</p>
<p>It's never hard to find traditional music in New Glarus. After dinner, I
walked down the street, where the New Glarus Yodel Club was performing
on the lawn of the Swiss Church.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Its members were crooning lovely folk harmonies, with the lilting
yo-ho-ho as a refrain — easy to parody if you've never heard it, but
actually a very expressive kind of music, melancholy or festive to suit
the lyrics.</p>
<p>The tiny town also has a Männerchor, or men's chorus, which sponsors
Volksfest in August. Its Roger Bright Polka Band performs weekends at
the New Glarus Hotel and at Polkafest, in June.</p>
<p>Tourists, of course, love this town and its festivals. The refreshing
thing is, there's not a trace of kitsch. In New Glarus, being Swiss
means much more than cuckoo clocks, cowbells and fondue.</p>
