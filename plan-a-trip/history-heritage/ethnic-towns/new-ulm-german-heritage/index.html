<h2>In southern Minnesota, New Ulm hangs on to a colorful heritage.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_ulm_hermann_spring.jpg" alt="New Ulm's Hermann monument." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>There are few towns more conspicuously American than New Ulm, Minn.</p>
<p>Laid out by the town founders, its wide streets follow an orderly grid
toward downtown, where cars park at an angle in front of boxy brick
businesses and meat-and-potatoes cafes.</p>
<p>There are softball games and Friday-night fish fries and many friendly
people. It's the epitome of small-town America-and yet this is a
town famous for being German.</p>
<p>There are hints, for sure. On a lonely plaza downtown, the carillon
bells of a concrete-and-brick Glockenspiel chime three times a day as
animated figures revolve below, like a cuckoo clock.</p>
<p>Gift shops stock nutcrackers and wood pyramids, and there are gnomes in
the window of the used-books store.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Atop a 70-foot columned dome, the Teutonic folk hero Hermann brandishes
his sword over town.</p>
<p>But at first glance, New Ulm doesn't look or sound much like a German
town, despite the oompah music the chamber of commerce pipes onto the
street.</p>
<p>The qualities associated with Germans — thrift, practicality,
industriousness — turned out to be such a happy match for small-town
America that now it's hard to tell the difference.</p>
<h3>Settled by Turners</h3>
<p>Ironically, the first New Ulmers were not typical small-towners at all.</p>
<p>They were Turners, members of a society that promoted universal
education, German culture and physical fitness through gymnastics. Many
were socialists who had fled Germany after the nobility suppressed a
wave of democratic revolts in 1848.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_ulm_schell_spring.jpg" alt="Schell Brewery in New Ulm." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Schell Brewery, founded in 1860, is the second-oldest family-run brewery
in the nation.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From groups in Chicago and Cincinnati, they formed a land company that,
in 1854, found and bought a site for a town in Minnesota, at the
confluence of the Minnesota and Cottonwood rivers.</p>
<p>Calling themselves &quot;free-thinkers,&quot; the Turners advocated the
separation of church and state, women's rights and the abolition of
slavery. They were largely agnostic, and they liked to get together and
drink beer on Sundays.</p>
<p>This enraged such people as Harriet Bishop, a Baptist missionary better
known as St. Paul's first schoolteacher.</p>
<p>&quot;With no religious restraints, they became strong in wickedness (and)
defiant of the restraints of the Gospel,&quot; she wrote.</p>
<p>New Ulm has changed over the years. Today, it's politically
conservative and home of a college and high school operated by the
Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, which is so conservative it
doesn't allow women to vote on church matters or take on any church
roles that involve authority over men.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The people still like to drink beer, though. And New Ulm still is the
most German city in Minnesota, with 66 percent of its residents claiming
German ancestry in the 2000 census, as opposed to 38 percent of the
state at large.</p>
<p>That's why I finally had to take my German-born husband there to see
it. Since arriving here in 1997, he'd been noticing the highway
billboards: &quot;Discover Germany in Minnesota.&quot;</p>
<h3>Let the good times roll</h3>
<p>Luckily, I knew just where to take him. On previous trips, I'd
hobnobbed with masked <em>Narren</em> at
Fasching, the German equivalent of Mardi Gras.</p>
<p>I'd flapped my elbows to the &quot;Little Chicken Dance&quot; at a New Ulm
festival. And I'd scoured the town's shops for blown-glass ornaments
and Advent calendars at Christmas.</p>
<p>Our first stop was Schell Brewery, whose picturesque grounds are a kind
of town square in New Ulm.</p>
<p>It always has been a neighborly place; when the Dakota Indians lay siege
to the town in 1862, the 2-year-old brewery was left unharmed because
its owners had shared food with them.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_ulm_glockenspiel_plaza.jpg" alt="New Ulm's Glockenspiel." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Glockenspiel's figures come out to play three times a day.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>August Schell was one of the original Turners and always allowed
visitors to wander the wooded grounds around his 1885 brick home;
current proprietor Ted Marti, his great-great-grandson, does the same.</p>
<p>As we drove through the neighborhoods toward the brewery, Torsten made
his first observation about New Ulm.</p>
<p>&quot;I hate to say it, but this looks very tidy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The town isn't German for nothing. The brewery still has the black
pines that August's son, Otto, brought over from the family hamlet near
the Black Forest.</p>
<p>As we walked down the paths and past a fanciful fountain designed by
German-Bohemian artist Anton Gág, one of August Schell's proteges, we
heard a sound not unlike a fingernail scraped down a blackboard.</p>
<p>It was coming from a peacock perched on a sawhorse. As soon as it saw
us, it jumped onto the grass, shot out its cobalt feathers and began a
slow pirouette, like a runway model.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_ulm_domeiers.jpg" alt="Domeiers German Store in New Ulm." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Domeiers store is the place to go for imported German goods.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We walked on the Museum of Brewing, which has a handsome Rathskeller and
patio for visitors on the brewery tour.</p>
<p>In the gift shop, T-shirts displayed the Schell slogans: &quot;Never Ask a
Gnome to Hold Your Beer,&quot; &quot;Never Trust a Brewery Under 140 Years Old&quot;
and &quot;When You're Surrounded by 14,000 Thirsty Germans, You Better Make
a Darn Good Beer!&quot;</p>
<h3>Goods from the old country</h3>
<p>Shopping always has been a sport in New Ulm, especially for German
goods.</p>
<p>Downtown, gift shops sell every kind of stein and souvenir. We drove
down Minnesota Street to Domeiers, a small neighborhood grocery that, in
1963, began to cater to German-born brides brought home by New Ulm
servicemen. It's packed with imported foodstuffs as well as gifts, and
soon I heard a delighted cry.</p>
<p>Torsten was holding a box of chocolate-covered marshmallow cookies, a
childhood favorite his family called Moors' heads.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of these things I haven't had in years,&quot; he said with a big
sigh. &quot;It's funny, all those memories. It really is true that love
goes through the stomach.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The most German place in town, of course, is Turner Hall. Completed in
1858 and rebuilt after it was destroyed in the 1862 Dakota Conflict, it
still has an active gymnastics and cultural program.</p>
<p>You won't hear much about free-thinking any more, but it's a good
place to hoist a beer and chat with the locals.</p>
<p>In the Rathskeller, 1873 murals of Rhine castles wrap around three
walls, which also hold such curios as a wood board illustrating the
lyrics of the drinking song &quot;Ist das nicht eine Schnitzel Bank.&quot;</p>
<h3>Preserving culture</h3>
<p>Upstairs, the Turner Ladies were holding a fund-raiser, selling cookies
and cinnamon rolls as well as <em>Schmierkuchen,</em> a coffeecake made with prunes and
cottage cheese, and jars of homemade sauerkraut and potato salad.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_narren.jpg" alt="The Narren of New Ulm." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
New Ulm's Narren, folk figures with wooden masks, are invited to appear
at German festivals around the region.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Continuing our rounds, Torsten and I watched a performance of the
Glockenspiel and drove up to Hermann Heights Park to visit Hermann, the
warrior who united the Alemannic tribes and routed the Romans from the
Teutoberg Forest in 9 A.D.</p>
<p>He's 32 feet of pure pagan, but the town loved him enough to order a
$1.1 million renovation.</p>
<p>And we stopped by the Sausage Shop, where Torsten bought a dozen of his
favorite Landjaeger sausages and the butcher sliced me a sample of
<em>Sultz</em> — head cheese.</p>
<p>It wasn't always easy being German in New Ulm. In the days leading up
to Prohibition, a temperance speaker called New Ulm &quot;the vilest spot on
the face of the Earth.&quot;</p>
<p>At the start of World War I, the governor removed the mayor and city
attorney from office for questioning the war, and the town was viciously
criticized throughout Minnesota.</p>
<p>Even neighboring Sleepy Eye put up a banner reading &quot;Berlin — 10
miles east.&quot; And during World War II, out-of-towners who wanted to
&quot;kill a German&quot; practiced on Hermann.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_ulm_schells_stag.jpg" alt="A stag at Schell Brewery." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Stag statues adorn the grounds of Schell Brewery.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But 99 percent of today's population was born American. In 2005, the
city decided to discontinue Heritagefest, which once drew 40,000 people
for two weekends of pilsener, pork buns and polka music, much of it
performed by musicians flown in from Germany, Austria and Switzerland.</p>
<p>&quot;They just didn't have the younger crowd there, and they're the ones
who drink the beer,&quot; says Schell's Marti, whose early-spring Bock Fest has
become so successful it nearly overwhelms the brewery.</p>
<p>Heritagefest was succeeded by Bavarian Blast, held downtown around
German Park, amid gardens and a fountain. There's polka but also an art
fair, a coffee and wine cafe with classical piano, a street dance, swing
bands and events for kids and teens.</p>
<p>Resident Richard Runck told us that visitors need to be patient when
looking for the German New Ulm.</p>
<p>&quot;The Germans, they come over here with great aspirations of seeing a
German village, and they're somewhat disappointed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's almost like an archaeological site now. You'll find little
pieces of evidence remaining if you go around town, but as a collection,
it's not together. You've got to know what you're looking for before
you see it.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_ulm_glockenspiel_figures.jpg" alt="New Ulm's Glockenspiel figures." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>From beer to wine</h3>
<p>It's no theme park, that's for sure. And this town of supposedly
thirsty Germans doesn't even have a beer garden where people can sit on
balmy summer nights.</p>
<p>It does, however, have a truly excellent wine patio. Eight miles east of
New Ulm, Ted Marti's brother Georg runs Morgan Creek Vineyards, with a
winery built into a landscaped hillside.</p>
<p>When we stopped by on a Saturday evening, a jazz trio was playing, Marti
was pouring wine and the stone patio was filled with laughing people
eating pizza from a wood-fired oven and enjoying a view of bucolic
countryside that included a low red barn and the most magnificent oak
tree we'd ever seen.</p>
<p>&quot;It was definitely a selling point when we bought it,&quot; Marti said.</p>
<p>The venture, he said, came about entirely through serendipity. He
stumbled across the spot while he was looking for firewood and started a
winery after someone suggested he grow grapes.</p>
<p>He serves pizzas because he was looking for an outdoor bread oven, but
one of his cooking-class guests who sells them said they make great
pizza.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_ulm_brown_museum.jpg" alt="New Ulm's Brown County Museum." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

War of 1862.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On a warm spring night, the atmosphere was enchanting.</p>
<p>So we didn't see any half-timbered buildings or geraniums tumbling
picturesquely out of window boxes. But we had a good time, Torsten got a
taste of home, and we met a lot of really nice folks.</p>
<p>&quot;What you see here is real and authentic,&quot; said Richard Runck. &quot;It's
just not what people imagine it to be.&quot;</p>
