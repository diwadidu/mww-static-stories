<h2>Many of our most-loved traditions arrived with emigrants from Germany.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_ulm_glockenspiel_plaza.jpg" alt="New Ulm's Glockenspiel." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>It's hard to imagine life without the Germans.</p>
<p>When they crossed the ocean, they brought hot dogs, potato salad and
beer gardens. Thanks to them, we have kindergartens, Christmas trees and
fairy tales.</p>
<p>Their traditions now are woven into the fabric of Upper Midwest life. To
paraphrase the words of John F. Kennedy, we are all Germans.</p>
<p>Germans are fun folks-at least, they like a party. Thanks to them,
we have Oktoberfests all fall, Christkindl markets over the holidays
and, to welcome spring, Maifests.</p>
<p>That's when young women dance around May poles and everyone gets to eat
strudel and drink Maibock beer. In Iowa's <a href="http://www.festivalsinamana.com/maifest.html">Amana
Colonies</a>, Maifest is the
traditional first weekend in May.</p>
<p>Near Milwaukee in <a href="http://maifestgermantown.com/">Germantown</a>, it's
the third weekend. In <a href="http://www.mayfestchicago.com/">Chicago</a>, it's
the last weekend.</p>
<p>Germans are by far the largest group in Wisconsin, land of beer and
brats. There, 44 percent of residents reported Germany ancestry in the
2000 census. In Iowa, it's 40 percent.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Minnesota does have the nation's highest concentrations of Norwegians
and Swedes. But it, too, is predominantly German-way German.</p>
<p>There, 38 percent of Minnesotans reported German ancestry. The
next-largest groups were Norwegians, 17 percent; Irish, 12 percent; and
Swedes, 10 percent.</p>
<p>In Illinois and Michigan, only 20 percent report German ancestry, but
that's still the largest ethnic group.</p>
<p>Throw a dart at a map, and you'll hit a town full of Germans.</p>
<h3>Why they came</h3>
<p>In 1848, a wave of rebellions broke out against the autocratic princes
and barons who ruled Germany, which was not a country but a loose
collection of near-feudal states.</p>
<p>After the revolts were suppressed, many of their middle-class organizers
fled to America.</p>
<p>Their arrival coincided with the signing of Indian treaties that opened
the best farmland to settlers.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_lady_narren.jpg" alt="Two lady Narren at Oktoberfest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was good timing for both the Germans and the state, said the late
Madison historian Richard Zeitlin, author of &quot;Germans in Wisconsin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The state was lucky because the German people had the skills and
cultural values that fit with the values of the times,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;They had long-term vision. They were there to make something more than
it was. It was a fertile land, just waiting for a hard-working people to
come and put down roots and transform it.&quot;</p>
<p>But many of the new immigrants were urban, and they weren't all poor
when they arrived.</p>
<p>Calling themselves &quot;freethinkers,&quot; they had a passion for education,
equality and clean government. In Milwaukee, they formed so many social
and cultural clubs the city became known as &quot;the German Athens.&quot;</p>
<p>In nearby Watertown, a freethinker started the nation's first
kindergarten in 1856.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>That same year, a group of Turners, freethinkers who promoted physical
fitness, settled New Ulm in Minnesota; for decades, the town's library
and high school was at Turner Hall.</p>
<p>In Milwaukee, freethinking Germans sent a Socialist to the U.S. Congress
in 1910, and a Socialist was mayor from 1916 to 1960, with an eight-year
break in the 1940s.</p>
<p>Called &quot;sewer socialism&quot; because it promoted the orderly delivery of
services to all citizens, their approach to politics exists even today
in Wisconsin and Minnesota, said historian Zeitlin, though not solely
because of the Germans.</p>
<p>&quot;That progressive viewpoint was not an American viewpoint; it was
strongly European,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Clean government, government involved in improving the life of the
community-those things were considered forward thinking, and that
resonated with Germans and Norwegians. What you got was an alliance of
these two immigrant groups.&quot;</p>
<p>Mainly, the Germans wanted to have a good life. Unlike the more
puritanical Yankees, they liked to get out and about on Sundays,
gathering with family and friends over food and drink. They enjoyed
their beer-and they liked a party.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/bemidji_waldsee.jpg" alt="Concordia's Waldsee German campus." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Language Villages' Waldsee campus.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Over the years, the stereotypical German has become a beer-bellied goof
in a furry green hat, bobbing up and down and flapping his elbows to
oompah music.</p>
<p>Germans not only gave us &quot;The Little Chicken Dance,&quot; but they also
invented kitsch, from garden gnomes to cuckoo clocks and Wayne Newton
crooning &quot;Danke Schoen.&quot;</p>
<p>But we forgive them; for one thing, we couldn't have a festival without
their beer, bratwurst and polka bands. And secretly, we love it all.</p>
<h3>German towns</h3>
<p>Around here, there are many ways to get in touch with your inner German.
Certain towns are bastions of Teutonic culture. Along Lake Michigan,
from Milwaukee to Sheboygan, it's hard to find anything that wasn't
influenced by the Germans.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/sheboygan-wisconsin/">Sheboygan</a></strong>
calls itself the bratwurst capital of the nation. In nearby <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/best-elkhart-lake-wisconsin/">Elkhart
Lake</a></strong>
, immigrants from Germany built grand lakeside resorts.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_oktoberfest_band.jpg" alt="A German brass band plays." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Elk River German Band plays at festivals around the region.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/summer-milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a></strong>
, tourists go to Old World Third Street to buy smoked sausages at
Usinger's and have a meal in heavily Teutonic Mader's restaurant.
German Fest, held on the lakefront in July, is the largest German
celebration in North America.</p>
<p>In western Minnesota, heavy concentrations of Germans settled in the
fertile farmland between the Minnesota and Mississippi river valleys,
where towns bear the names New Germany, Hamburg, Cologne and New
Munich.</p>
<p>And at the junction of the Minnesota and Cottonwood rivers, a group of
German workingmen and Turners bought land and established the town of
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-ulm-german-heritage/">New Ulm</a></strong> .</p>
<p>Along with schools and churches, they took time in 1897 to put up a
32-foot copper statue of the Alemannic warrior Hermann, who routed the
Romans from the Teutoburg Forest in 9 A.D.</p>
<p>His hillside throne is part of the New Ulm tourist route, as is
Domeier's German Store, the Glockenspiel downtown and Schell's
Brewery, the second-oldest family-owned brewery in the nation and likely
the most picturesque.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In eastern Iowa, a group of devout German Inspirationists formed a
communal society in 1855, pooling their resources and adhering
faithfully to Scripture. The name they gave their settlement,
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/amana-colonies/">Amana</a></strong> , comes from the
Bible and means &quot;remain true.&quot;</p>
<p>They dropped the communal system in 1932 but retained their language and
traditions. Today, restaurants in the seven Amana Colonies still serve
meals family-style, and Millstream Brewery makes its beers according to
old German purity laws.</p>
<p>The skills Amana workers developed-they were known for weaving,
woodcrafting and wine-making-ts residents now use to draw tourists
to the many shops and artisan studios.</p>
<h3>Festivals</h3>
<p>When it comes to a party, Germans know how to take a good idea and run
with it-but you don't need to be German to join in.</p>
<p>They're everywhere, butÂ  they include:</p>

<h3>Language and culture</h3>
<p>German was the first language taught at <a href="http://www.concordialanguagevillages.com/">Concordia Language
Villages</a>, an immersion camp
started in 1961 by an elementary-education professor at the Moorhead
college who saw how quickly children of U.S. servicemen in Germany
picked up the language.</p>
<p>Today, the Waldsee campus on a lake near Bemidji hosts immersion camps
for youth all summer and weekend camps for adults and families.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/learning-vacations/adult-language-camps/">Language camp for
adults</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/concordia-family-camp/">Going abroad in
Bemidji</a>.</p>
<p>In St. Paul, the <a href="http://www.gai-mn.org/">Germanic-American Institute</a>
is an active association of native Germans as well as people of German
ancestry.</p>

<p>It offers its 1,400 members language classes, lectures, trips, cultural
groups and dinners, and it frequently opens its house on Summit Avenue
to the public for festivities, including Deutscher Tag in June.</p>
<p>In Madison, Wis., the <a href="http://mki.wisc.edu/">Max Kade Institute for German-American
Studies</a> at University of Wisconsin offers
lectures and workshops to the public.</p>
<p>In Davenport, Iowa, the <a href="http://www.gahc.org">German American Heritage
Center</a> offers classes, talks and events and
includes the permanent, interactive exhibit &quot;The German Immigrant
Experience&quot; as well as rotating exhibits.</p>
<p>In the countryside near Dodgeville, in southwestern Wisconsin, <a href="http://www.folklorevillage.com/">Folklore
Village</a> presents ethnic workshops,
concerts and festivities, including the lighting of a candlelit German
Christmas tree in December.</p>
<h3>Heritage sites</h3>
<p>At <a href="http://oldworldwisconsin.wisconsinhistory.org/">Old World Wisconsin</a>, the nation's largest outdoor museum of rural life, three German
homesteads from around Wisconsin have been moved to the sprawling site
just southwest of Milwaukee and reconstructed.</p>
<p>In the summer, interpreters take visitors back to the years 1860, 1875
and 1880, explaining how immigrants observed Old World traditions and
adopted new ones. A restaurant occupies the Clausing Barn, an octagonal
barn built by a German immigrant in 1897.</p>
<p>Near Milwaukee in Germantown, the <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/architecture/dheinsville-settlement-bast-bell-museum-203893">Dheinsville
Settlement</a>
includes original half-timbered buildings.</p>
<p>In the west-central Iowa town of Manning, <a href="http://germanhausbarn.com/">Hausbarn Heritage
Park</a> includes a handsome 1660 half-timbered
brick house/barn brought over from the northern German state of
Schleswig-Holstein and reassembled with a roof thatched with reeds grown
near the Baltic Sea.</p>
