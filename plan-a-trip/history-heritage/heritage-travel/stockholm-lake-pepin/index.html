<h2>Once the promised land, a Lake Pepin village now is a favorite day trip.</h2>

<p>Once, people went through hell to get to Stockholm, Wis.</p>
<p>It's different nowadays. It's only a joy ride away from the Twin
Cities, and the streets of this pretty hamlet on Lake Pepin are lined
with sports cars and motorcycles on weekends.</p>
<p>There are shops, galleries and inns; it's the place to go for a room
with a view or vroom with a brew.</p>
<p>In 1854, this bit of land at the foot of the Mississippi bluffs was the
destination of more than 200 emigrants from the impoverished village of
Bjurtjärn, Sweden. Promised &quot;paradise on earth,&quot; they instead endured
cholera, deprivation and betrayal.</p>
<p>Once, the locals assumed all the immigrants who left had made it to
Stockholm. Then, the Bjurtjärn Theatre Group showed up in town with
their historical play &quot;Off to America: They Sold Their Homesteads.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Speaking dialogue in English and singing in Swedish, they told the
engrossing story of how Stockholm really was founded, based on a
19th-century article in a Swedish newspaper and their own research.</p>
<p>In rural Sweden, farmhand Petter Pettersson had read news of the Gold
Rush. In 1849, he left for America with his brothers Erik and Anders,
who felt oppressed not just by poverty but also by rigid social classes
enforced by a tyrannical pastor, district judge and constable.</p>
<p>Petter and Anders went to California, but Erik worked as a lumberjack on
the Mississippi, where he found a town site on Lake Pepin.</p>
<p>He wrote home to the oldest brother, Jakob, and not long after Jakob had
left for America, Erik returned to Sweden to recruit colonists with
tales of free land and &quot;soil rich like butter.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1854, he left Bjurtjärn with more than 200 people, from the richest
landowner to the wife of the town drunk, who had her husband declared
&quot;incapacitated&quot; so she could leave without him.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stockholm_shoppers.jpg" alt="Shoppers enter a store in little Stockholm, Wis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>But Erik was a scoundrel. He pocketed their money and put them into the
cheapest ship's quarters, where many became ill; on the train west, he
packed them into cattle cars.</p>
<p>A third of the villagers died, including his own mother, whom he
pretended not to know so he could avoid paying for her funeral.</p>
<p>Others decamped in Moline, Ill., after sending a sheriff to retrieve
some of their money, and the man who became known as the &quot;King of
Stockholm&quot; arrived with only 30 colonists.</p>
<h3>A Swedish-Wisconsin connection</h3>
<p>Many of Jakob's descendants were in the audience, including Sally
Meixner of Stockholm.</p>
<p>&quot;I was surprised they remembered us,&quot; she said. &quot;There must be all
kinds of stories that are passed on.&quot;</p>
<p>Jakob Pettersson and his small party also encountered adversity on the
way over.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The captain of their ship died, and his inexperienced son took over,
ramming the boat into an iceberg before veering south to the tropics; in
Moline, Ill., the Petterssons' daughter died.</p>
<p>In Stockholm, Jakob became Jacob Peterson and, with his wife, Sara, a
daughter of the feared district judge, lived in a log cabin for 15
years.</p>
<p>In 1869, he built a two-story stone cottage modeled after a painting of
Sara's childhood home. Today, the painting hangs in the town museum.</p>
<p>Once, 300 people lived in Stockholm. They farmed and ran stores but also
brewed lemon beer, bred kosher carp and dredged for clams used in
buttons, eking out a living any way they could.</p>
<p>But the town site was more pretty than practical, and there was no way
for the town to grow.</p>
<p>It had virtually withered away by the time artistic types from the Twin
Cities found it and in 1980 opened the first gallery, followed by
antiques and gifts shops and a cafe.</p>

<h3>New life as a shopping destination</h3>
<p>Now, nearly all the businesses have turned over, and a new generation of
shopkeepers is operating in Stockholm.</p>
<p>Shops occupy the old opera house/general store, featuring the work of
local artists, such as Gaylord Schanilec's prints, Mary Logue's hooked
rugs, Perry Ingli's paintings and Lucy Elliott's shrines.</p>
<p>&quot;It's unbelievable, the talent in this little tiny place,&quot; says
longtime shop owner Alan Nugent. &quot;The premier talents in certain fields
are located right here in Stockholm.&quot;</p>
<p>But what customers want most, he says, are pieces that portray bluffs,
river scenes, barns-anything that looks like Stockholm.</p>
<p>&quot;They want a piece of this place,&quot; he says. &quot;There's something
magical down here, and people respond to it. You hear about people who
go down for a weekend visit and come back with a house.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The people who are attracted by Stockholm's beauty tend to sow more
beauty.</p>
<p>Many of the hollyhocks and lilies  in gardens up and down the river come
from Stockholm Gardens, whose proprietors sell a wide selection of
plants and maintain a glorious perennial garden.</p>
<p>In the tiny downtown, the contents of shops have changed, but little
else. The whitewash still is peeling on the limestone facade of the 1864
Merchants' Hotel building, which has housed a variety of inns.</p>
<p>Trains still thunder by next to the old house that houses an artisan
collective. Birds nest under the sidewalk overhang of Northern Oak Amish
furniture, in an old farm-implements store that's still heated by a
wood-burning stove.</p>
<p>Around the corner, Nancy Fitzsimons and daughter Shana Finnegan operate
The Palate in a bungalow where they hold cooking classes and sell
kitchenware, wine and gourmet food.</p>
<p>Finnegan bustles around her countertop, preparing tasty morsels to offer
customers. She grew up in Stockholm, she said, and inherited a love of
entertaining from her Swedish grandmother.</p>

Jacob Peterson's 1869 cottage served for many years as a
bed-and-breakfast.

<p>Every July, the village of 97 is flooded with people looking for
beautiful things during the annual Stockholm Art Fair in Village Park.
It's the biggest day of the year in the town.</p>
<p>Visitors listen to music, snack on ice cream or pie and shop their
hearts out. For a break, they sit on the benches along Spring Street and
watch the world go by.</p>
<p>For the first settlers, Stockholm was home but hardly the paradise on
earth they'd been promised. To day-trippers, though, it's close
enough.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Stockholm, Wisconsin</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> It's 1½ hours from the Twin Cities. If you drive via
Prescott, stop to check out the Great River Road Visitor and Learning
Center on Wisconsin 35 south of town, overlooking the confluence of the
Mississippi and St. Croix rivers.</p>
<p><em>When to go:</em> On Thursdays and Fridays in summer, nearly all the shops
and restaurants are open, but there's less motorcycle traffic on the
River Road.</p>
<p>A few shops close for a day early in the week, but most are open daily
through October, then weekends through Christmas; they close for winter
and reopen for weekends in March.</p>
<p>Non-motorcyclists may want to avoid the April and November benefit
