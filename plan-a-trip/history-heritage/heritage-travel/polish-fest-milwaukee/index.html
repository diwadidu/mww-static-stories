<h2>At Milwaukee's lakefront festivals, visitors get a big helping of another culture.</h2>

<p>On a beautiful summer day in Milwaukee, history's underdogs were having
a ball.</p>
<p>They were listening to pianists play Chopin. They were dancing an
exuberant style of polka. They were tucking into pierogi and paczki.</p>
<p>Call it payback time for Poles.</p>
<p>The 20th century was hard on the Poles. Many immigrated to Wisconsin,
giving it the nation's highest percentage of residents with Polish
ancestry. They were thousands of miles from home, but they still had a
yen for potato pancakes.</p>
<p>So in 1981, Milwaukee's Poles — some of whom had first-hand
experience with panzers and Politburos — put on the first Polish Fest.</p>
<p>It was a hit. Over the years, things improved in the old country; Poland
cast off the Communists and joined the European Union. But that didn't
change anything in Milwaukee, along the shores of Lake Michigan.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Polish Fest now is the largest Polish celebration in the nation. It's
the first of the big heritage festivals in Milwaukee's 90-acre Maier
Festival Park. Festa Italiana and German Fest, which come in July, also
are huge affairs, drawing pilgrims from around the nation.</p>
<p>Not Polish? No problem.</p>
<p>My only connection to Polish culture is my fondness for their pierogi,
filled dumplings that are fried in butter with onions and served with
horseradish-laced sour cream.</p>
<p>Now, this isn't the kind of thing you want to eat every day. But you
have to admire a culture that makes comfort food like that.</p>
<p>And those of us who belong to groups who also are the butt of jokes —
say, those of us who are Scandihoovian blondes from Iowa — can relate
to the long-suffering Poles.</p>
<p>So one June, my husband and I became Poles for a day. Two days,
actually. We become so entranced by the music — zydeco-laced polka,
with a trace of mariachi — that we had to go back.</p>
<h3>Gotta polka</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/polka_police.jpg" alt="Polka police at Milwaukee's Polish Fest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>The dancing started at the front gate, where Jan Stasiak of the Polka
Police apprehended us, making us do a few turns on the spot.</p>
<p>&quot;It's my duty,&quot; said Stasiak, who lives in Ontario, Wis., and follows
her favorite bands around the region. &quot;I do what I can for polka.&quot;</p>
<p>Sporting our new &quot;Learn to polka — it's the law&quot; stickers, we
wandered through the festival grounds. We watched &quot;The Tale of Pon
Tzardofski,&quot; in which a Polish nobleman sells his soul to the devil in
exchange for riches and, instead of sinking into shame, tricks him into
taking his nagging wife.</p>
<p>We listened to a story about the Wawel Dragon and the shoemaker, who
became king by feeding the dragon a ram stuffed with sulfur, which
burned his throat and made him drink so much water he burst.</p>
<p>We took a polka lesson and watched a nun making wycinanki, paper
cutouts. And we listened to identical-triplet violinists. The
long-legged, flaxen-haired Okapiec sisters are triple-blessed: They've
been playing since age 6, they compose their own music and they look
like supermodels.</p>
<p>But we spent most of our time at the Krakus Ham Non-Stop Polka Stage.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>My husband, who had his fill of oompah-style polka growing up in
Germany, couldn't believe how cool the music was — polka waylaid in
New Orleans and hijacked to Tijuana.</p>
<p>At the Cultural Village, I collared Polish Fest committee member Rich
Tyszka and got him to explain.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of the earliest Polish and German communities were in Texas; they
heard Mexican <em>tecate</em>, and you know,
music tends to blend together,&quot; he said. &quot;Polka is really not Polish;
it's more German and Czech. But here in America, we borrowed here and
there and came up with our own style.&quot;</p>
<p>The dancing is athletic, like swing with bounce, and young dancers do it
with some serious butt-swiveling. Even the musicians were jumping; the
young trumpeter for the Polka Family Band was bobbing his head as if he
were at a rave.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the new Polish style, with a lot of turning and spinning,&quot;
said Len Tate of Duluth, Ga. &quot;I'm glad to see the younger people doing
it; I'd hate to see polka dwindle away.&quot;</p>
<p>Tate said he and his wife, Pat, had skipped another big festival, Polka
Spree by the Sea in New Jersey, to come to Milwaukee for Polish Fest.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_polish_storytellers.jpg" alt="Storytellers at Polish Fest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;We're polka groupies,&quot; he said. &quot;We wear red and white, and we know
all the bands.&quot;</p>
<p>Dancers Edwin Bialobrzeski and his wife, Millie, danced a more sedate
style of polka, but like the younger dancers, they barely sat down.</p>
<p>&quot;I started going to Polish Fest in 1982 and haven't missed one, and
I'll keep going as long as I last,&quot; said Edwin Bialobrzeski, who was
Wisconsin Polka Champion in 1983.</p>
<p>Bialobrzeski was born in the United States in 1929, he said, but his
father took the family back to Poland, and that's where they were when
Hitler invaded in 1939. The young U.S. citizen spent the war dodging
Nazis: &quot;I could write a book,&quot; he said.</p>
<h3>More pierogi, please</h3>
<p>As we were sitting at a picnic table near the stage, 14-year-old
Katelynn Prebish brushed by, complaining that she &quot;wasn't done
dancing.&quot;</p>
<p>Dancing runs in the family, said her mother, Karen Prebish, who had
summoned Katelynn to dinner.</p>
<p>&quot;My parents were both Polish, and on Sunday afternoons, all we did was
dance,&quot; she said. &quot;We'd move the furniture and tune in a program on
TV, and we all danced. It was fun.&quot;</p>
<p>You'd better dance, if you're going to eat Polish food. My husband got
the Polish plate from Polonez restaurant — Polish sausage, cabbage
roll, sauerkraut, pierogi with sour cream and a potato pancake with
applesauce — and tucked into it with relish.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again, heritage through the stomach never fails,&quot; he said.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I got pierogi, mushroom soup and strawberry paczki, a jelly-filled fried
roll. And on the recommendation of Barbara Cherney, I tried czarnina, a
sweet, dark soup made with raisins and duck's blood.</p>
<p>&quot;It's my favorite,&quot; she said. &quot;My dad used to make it.&quot;</p>
<p>Both grandparents came from Poland, she said, and her grandmother never
learned English.</p>
<p>&quot;When I was a little girl, I spoke Polish like I stepped off the boat,
until I was about 7,&quot; she said. &quot;But when you don't use it, you
forget it.&quot;</p>
<p>Cherney and her husband, John, also come to Maier Festival Park for
German Fest and Festa Italiana.</p>
<p>&quot;You should come for Italy Fest,&quot; she said. &quot;You can't even get in;
it's just mobbed. There are all these little old ladies in red and
green caps.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really, from now on, there's a party every weekend,&quot; said John
Cherney.</p>
<p>Unlike most towns in the Midwest, Milwaukee was settled first by newly
immigrated Germans, not Yankees. City historian John Gurda says that
made it OK to be different, and it's the reason why diversity is so
celebrated today.</p>
<p>If there's not a lakefront festival devoted to your origins, there's
probably one elsewhere in Milwaukee or around the region. When the
parties start, you're welcome to piggyback on any heritage you choose.</p>
