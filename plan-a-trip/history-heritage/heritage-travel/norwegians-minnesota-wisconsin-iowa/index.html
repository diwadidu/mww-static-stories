<h2>Long after the first immigrants arrived, descendants' love of the culture stays strong.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_grove_float.jpg" alt="A Viking ship float in Spring Grove." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A Viking ship is part of the Syttende Mai parade in Spring Grove, Minn.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Across the Upper Midwest, an unusually large number of people know that
<em>bunad</em> is not a crude anatomical term
and that <em>krumkake</em> is something sweet
from a bakery.</p>
<p>More than perhaps any other European immigrants, Norwegian-Americans
have carried on old-country traditions, even those that folks back in
Norway largely have dropped (see: lutefisk-eating).</p>
<p>They're on full display in May, when Norwegians celebrate the
anniversary of the signing of a democratic constitution on May 17, or
Syttende Mai.</p>
<p>From the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge to Stoughton and Westby in
Wisconsin, Spring Grove in Minnesota and the Red River Valley,
Norwegian-Americans will be fiddling, folk-dancing and troll-hunting.</p>
<p>Today, even Norwegians from Norway marvel at the extent to which
Norwegian-Americans have preserved the culture they left.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Many women own bunads, the dresses whose colors and embroidery identify
the region from which their ancestors came.</p>
<p>They make krumkake, a delicate cone-shaped cookie, and bake scalloped
sandbakkels, both made with lots of butter. They practice rosemaling,
painting floral designs on wood, and carve wood in intricate acanthus
leaf patterns.</p>
<p>Some play the eight-stringed Hardanger fiddle, whose haunting notes
sound like homesickness.</p>
<p>Though most immigrants were desperately poor, they hated to leave Norway
— so when they got here, they created lots of little Norways.</p>
<h3>Why they left</h3>
<p>In the 19th century, Norway was a bad place to be a peasant.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/o/mount_horeb_troll.jpg" alt="Roadside Distractions." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Its population was increasing, mostly squeezed onto the slivers of land
that could be cultivated — only 3 percent of the country.</p>
<p>Farm mechanization pushed out landless laborers, and a rigid social
hierarchy gave them no chance to improve their lot.</p>
<p>So, they left. Starting in the late 1830s, Norwegians came to
southeastern Wisconsin, forming enclaves that drew new immigrants.</p>
<p>The farmers stayed for a while before skipping to newer Norwegian
settlements in the coulee country of southwest Wisconsin, the bluff
country of southeast Minnesota and Iowa and then the fertile Red River
Valley of Minnesota and North Dakota.</p>
<p>Norwegians who fished headed for the rocky shorelines of Door County and
Minnesota's North Shore.</p>
<p>By 1915, Norway had lost 750,000 people to the United States,
contributing, after Ireland, the highest percentage of its population to
the new country.</p>

<h3>Hanging onto tradition</h3>
<p>But they didn't forget their homeland.</p>
<p>Each Christmas, Norwegian-Americans march into the nearest Norsk deli to
buy lutefisk, the lye-soaked dried cod that once was a staple for
peasants in Norway.</p>
<p>They grate potatoes for lefse, the flat peasant bread, and roll thin
butter cookies on krumkake irons.</p>
<p>They send their children to Norwegian camp, read them books about
mischievous trolls and dress them up in woolen Dale sweaters.</p>
<p>They put up troll and Viking statues in public spaces from Mount Horeb,
Wis., to Spring Grove, Minn., where bottles of the local Spring Grove
Soda bear the slogan &quot;Mange Tusen Takk,&quot; Norwegian for &quot;Thanks a
million.&quot;</p>
<p>Norwegians, it seems, are the most sentimental of immigrants, and they
often chose land that reminded them of home.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/bemidji_stavkirke.jpg" alt="A Norwegian stavkirke." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Norwegian campus of Concordia Language Villages in Bemidji includes
a small stavkirke, a medieval wooden church.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Humorist Garrison Keillor writes, &quot;Our ancestors chose this place,
tired from their long journey, sad for having left the motherland
behind, and this place reminded them of there, so they settled here,
forgetting that they had left there because the land wasn't so good.</p>
<p>&quot;So the new life turned out to be a lot like the old, except the
winters are worse.&quot;</p>
<h3>Festivals</h3>
<p>Syttende Mai (pronounced SEH-tend-ah MY)
is celebrated on the weekend closest to May 17 in Stoughton, Westby and
Woodville in Wisconsin; Spring Grove and Milan in Minnesota; and Park
Ridge in Illinois.</p>
<p>In <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/decorah-iowa-norwegian-heritage/">Decorah,
Iowa</a>, it's always celebrated May 17 with a traditional children's parade.</p>

to brag.</p>
