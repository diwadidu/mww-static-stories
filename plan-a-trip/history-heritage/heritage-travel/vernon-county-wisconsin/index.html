<h2>In the nooks of Wisconsin's coulee country, people of all kinds found a niche.</h2>

<p>In 1862, a poor Norwegian couple and their four small children,
including their infant son Thorvald, joined a wave of immigrants to
Wisconsin, eventually settling in the coulees of Vernon County.</p>
<p>Vernon County was an interesting place in the 1860s. Only a generation
before, Black Hawk and his band had fled through it, hounded by
militia.</p>
<p>They ran headlong into a slaughter that remains one of the most shameful
chapters in U.S. history. Today, 11 plaques mark the route, which ended
near the town of Victory.</p>
<p>Norwegians poured into the steep, flat-floored valleys that reminded
them of home. Italians fished along the Mississippi from a town they
called Genoa.</p>
<p>Free blacks already had arrived and were joined by newly freed slaves.
One of them had a son who became an expert builder of round barns, of
which Vernon County has the nation's highest concentration.</p>
<p>In 1966, Old Order Amish began arriving from Ohio, settling onto the
high ridges and tilling the land with horse-drawn plows. Like the
hard-working settlers before them, they thrived.</p>
<p>The land, while beautiful, is difficult. Glaciers slid around it rather
than over it, leaving a jumble of little valleys boxed in by pointy
hills.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Norwegians and former slaves</h3>
<p>The valleys weren't as rocky as the ones in Norway, however, and usually
a creek wound through their flat floors. This made the Norwegians
optimistic.</p>
<p>In 1865, my great-great-grandfather Rolf Olson Gauper of Chaseburg wrote
home to his father, Ole Trondsson Gauper.</p>
<p>&quot;When I consider my children, I think that their futures will be very
good, yes, much better than if I had stayed in Norway,&quot; he wrote.
&quot;Here, the common laborer and the poor are not so shamefully treated as
they are in Norway . . . Poverty is considered to be honest, and that
poor man will they eagerly help and support.&quot;</p>
<p>Black farmers found the same thing to be true on the east end of Vernon
County, among the Bohemians, Irish and Norwegians in Cheyenne Valley.
They were the largest community of rural blacks in Wisconsin, and old
photos show their complete integration into society.</p>
<p>One of their descendants, Gen Reko, attributed it to the practicalities
of life in an isolated valley.</p>
<p>&quot;One person didn't have more than the other, and if they did, they
shared,&quot; said Reko, who stayed in Cheyenne Valley. &quot;They all went to
school and church together, and as a whole, everybody got along fine.&quot;</p>
<p>Reko descended from Mycajah Revels, who was of Cherokee, African and
English ancestry and arrived in Vernon County in 1854.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/v/e/vernon_county_church.jpg" alt="A rural church in Vernon County." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>She was raised by her grandmother, Flora Shivers, and Flora's husband
Alga, a college-educated son of a former slave who built round barns,
spoke Czech and French and was one of the area's most popular residents.</p>
<p>One year, Reko helped organize a reunion that drew 250 descendants to
Hillsboro. &quot;People had lots of stories to tell about Algie,&quot; she said.</p>
<h3>Surprises everywhere</h3>
<p>Alga Shivers' round barns are among seven on a Cheyenne Valley heritage
tour mapped out for tourists.</p>
<p>Other driving tours include all 12 of the county's remaining round barns
and the route taken by Black Hawk and his band in 1832. And there are
tours for people who want to visit Amish farms and for bicyclists
looking for scenic routes.</p>
<p>Exploring is the thing to do in Vernon County. On a topographic map,
coulees are represented by tight little squiggles; equally squiggly
county roads follow creeks and rise to ridges that have spectacular
views.</p>
<p>From the towns of Romance to Avalanche, from Norwegian Hollow to Irish
Ridge, there's something surprising around every turn — a round barn,
a throng of wild turkeys, an Amish farmer bouncing on his plow.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Even before I knew that my great-grandfather Thorvald grew up in Vernon
County, I loved it.</p>
<p>One spring, I <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/spring-scenery/kickapoo-valley-wisconsin/">hunted morels and went for a bird
walk</a> in the Kickapoo
Valley Reserve. In summer, I <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kickapoo-river-canoeing-wisconsin/">canoed the crooked Kickapoo
River</a>, paddling in all four directions of the compass on just the six miles
south of Ontario.</p>
<p>Near Westby, I visited the open-air Norskedalen heritage museum and
froze my toes watching an <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/westby-ski-jumping/">international ski-jumping
competition</a>
on a 40-story jump lovingly maintained by local Norwegians.</p>
<p>One fall, I followed the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/black-hawk-war-wisconsin/">route of Black Hawk's
retreat</a>. Another fall, I took a
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/wisconsin-shopping-trip/">guided tour of Amish
farms</a>
along the county's northern border, around Cashton.</p>
<h3>Tracing ancestors</h3>
<p>I headed to Vernon County again one May, as flowering trees were
infusing the green hills with pink. Driving up Hamburg Ridge, I passed
the first of many bicyclists; local racers have discovered that these
punishing hills are a good place to train.</p>
<p>In Chaseburg, I stopped at Fortress Bank to ask for directions to Bad
Axe Lutheran Church, and manager Janet Stafslien sent me down to Purdy,
on the Bad Axe River.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really pretty down there,&quot; she said. &quot;People like to fish, and
now people from the cities are building houses down there.&quot;</p>
<p>People from La Crosse? &quot;No, Chicago,&quot; Stafslien said. &quot;That's what we
get around here.&quot;</p>
<p>The city folk are driving up land prices and taxes, a hardship for the
Amish, who are determined to buy farms near each other.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/n/ontario_wildcat_trail.jpg" alt="A hiking trail in Wildcat Mountain State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I hadn't known they'd settled this far west. Up the hill from Chaseburg,
I stopped to buy a blueberry pie at the Miller farm, whose matriarch
said they'd moved there in 1996.</p>
<p>Most of the Gaupers had died or left Vernon County by the 1930s. My
great-grandfather Thorvald was first to go, changing his name to Thomas
and decamping for Eau Claire before he was 18, apparently with his older
brother Lars, who became Lewis.</p>
<p>Their brothers Ole and Emil, however, are buried at Bad Axe Lutheran
Church, near the coulee where Ole's sorghum mill was washed away by a
flood.</p>
<p>From Purdy, I followed Norwegian Hollow into Viroqua, which occupies the
only flat stretch of Vernon County. It's the county's only outpost of
coffeehouse-and-gallery culture, as well as the home of both its
stoplights.</p>
<p>On the east side of town, past the big, red-brick buildings of the
Viroqua Leaf Tobacco Co. — the Norwegians were skilled cultivators —
I found the red-tiled Cina barn.</p>
<p>Round barns were easy to build, efficient and wind-resistant, but they
fell out of favor when square hay bales and pipeline milking systems
were introduced.</p>
<p>From there, I headed for a farm guesthouse to meet my children and
nieces, who had driven over to join me. They'd already seen lots of
Amish buggies clip-clopping over county roads and were fascinated by
their no-frills lifestyle.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel so sorry for those Amish boys,&quot; my son Peter said. &quot;No TV, no
computer, nothing.&quot;</p>
<h3>Visiting the Amish</h3>
<p>The next day we drove down to Ontario and two miles west to Der Bake
Oven, on an Amish farmyard where two small children in blue and black
clothes were swinging on a rope. They waved at us, but they were too shy
to return our hellos.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/e/westby_parade_nisse.jpg" alt="Norwegian elves in a parade." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then, with the freshly made doughnuts, raspberry rolls and bags of
cashew crunch that we bought, we drove up to Wildcat Mountain State
Park.</p>
<p>The Old Settlers Trail was only 2½ miles, but it took us past nearly
every feature of a coulee landscape.</p>
<p>From an overlook with a sweeping view of Ontario, we climbed onto a
cavity-riddled outcropping of gold sandstone and down the valley on a
path lined with trilliums and spring beauties.</p>
<p>A creek gurgled along on the valley floor, past clumps of marsh
marigolds. We walked through a corridor of red pines and ascended again,
stopping to take in another view just short of the end.</p>
<p>From the park, we took a glorious roller-coaster ride on County Road P
to the blue Evanstad barn near Dell, then north on D to sample squeaky
cheese curd at Old Country Cheese and back to Wisconsin 33 between
Cashton and Ontario, which is lined with Amish farms.</p>
<p>We stopped at one for more cashew crunch, but instead found a friendly
Amish man named David, trying to calm a colt he'd just bought.</p>
<p>The colt's parents, he told us, were racehorses. The Amish like to use
retired racehorses to pull their buggies because they're used to loud
noises, such as those made by passing cars.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>David invited us to look at the back of the barn, where a newborn colt
wobbled next to its blind mother, then took us to the basement and
brought out three wiggling Chihuahua-Jack Russell terrier puppies for us
to hold. He sells them as pets, he said.</p>
<p>The puppies made Peter's day.</p>
<p>&quot;All the Amish men we've run into have been jolly,&quot; he noted.</p>
<p>Heading home, we stopped at another farm, where an Amish girl in a green
shirt sold us plants. We found Pine Grove bakery on another farm and
bought maple syrup, jam, cookies and a mixed-berry pie with heart-shaped
cutouts; the hard-working baker noted ruefully she had only two
daughters to help her.</p>
<p>&quot;What a cool day,&quot; said my niece Alissa, when we got back. &quot;I feel as
if I'm in a different country — different landscape, different
people.&quot;</p>
<p>The next day, they rode bikes on the Elroy-Sparta State Trail and I
drove to two round barns near Mount Tabor, in the heart of the black
settlement, and to Cheyenne Settlers Heritage Park in Hillsboro.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Syttende Mai in Westby</h3>
<p>Then we all drove on to the Norwegian stronghold of Westby for the
annual Syttende Mai parade, celebrating Norwegian constitution day.</p>
<p>The Westby area was known as &quot;America's little Gudbrandsdal,&quot; after the
valley from which many immigrants came, including Rolf and Riah Gauper,
and it's still thoroughly Norwegian.</p>
<p>Visiting Norwegians, says gift-store owner Jana Dregne, often say the
locals are more Norwegian than they are.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't have industry,&quot; she jokes. &quot;We have heritage.&quot;</p>
