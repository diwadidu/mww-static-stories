<h2>From the old country, they brought a love of celebration and summer.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_andersonville_tourism.jpg" alt="A tour group in Andersonville." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Choose Chicago</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Chicago, the Andersonville neighborhood was settled by Swedes.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When the summer solstice arrives, nobody celebrates more than the
Swedes.</p>
<p>They put wreaths of flowers on their heads, dance around a vine-draped
pole and sing the praises of long, sunny days.</p>
<p>They're like everyone else in the northland, except they eat more
pickled herring.</p>
<p>Midsommar is the most beloved Swedish holiday, and it's celebrated
everywhere Swedes settled, especially the Chicago area, Minneapolis and
the St. Croix River Valley of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Besides music and dancing around the <em>majstang</em> , or Maypole, there will
be Dala horse-carving, smörgåsbord, straw goats, thin pepparkakor ginger
cookies and, perhaps, some ABBA songs. And a lot of adorable, towheaded
little girls in embroidered dresses, of course.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Why they came</h3>
<p>Much like immigrants from Norway, Swedes were pushed out of the old
country by class snobbery, religious rigidity and a shortage of farm
land and jobs.</p>
<p>Newly arrived Swedes were considered the &quot;good&quot; immigrants,
especially young Swedish women, who easily found jobs as housemaids in
middle- and upper-class households.</p>
<p>Men worked as farmers and lumberjacks. Many men from the impoverished
southern province of Småland, from which many immigrants came, were
skilled iron workers.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best-known destination for Swedes is Minnesota's Chisago
County, where Swedish settlers found &quot;a rich and stoneless Småland.&quot;</p>
<p>Their letters home started a boom that eventually gave Chisago County
the largest concentration of Swedes outside Sweden. In 1947, they drew
Swedish writer Vilhelm Moberg, who came to the area to research a
quartet of historical novels.</p>
<p>The novels became hugely popular in Sweden, and busloads of Swedes still
come to Chisago County to see pioneer-era landmarks mentioned in the
book.</p>
<p>They range from Scandia to Taylors Falls and Lindström, where signs mark
public buildings in both Swedish and English and the water tower is an
enameled coffeepot that proclaims &quot;Valkommen till Lindström.&quot;</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Festivals</h3>
<p>Some festivals include Norwegian and Danish traditions, although the
three countries have historic enmities. Norway was dominated by Denmark
until 1814 and by Sweden until 1905.</p>
<p>During World War II, neutral Sweden exported iron ore to Germany and
gave Nazi forces access to Norwegian ports. For celebration purposes,
however, history stopped at the time of Swedish immigration to the
United States, which peaked between 1870 and 1900.</p>

<h3>Heritage sites</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://swedishamericanmuseum.org/">Swedish American Museum</a> in
Chicago</strong> . Many Swedes settled in the Andersonville neighborhood north
of Wrigley Field, and there are still thriving remnants, especially
purveyors of Old World delicacies: the Swedish Bakery,  Wikstrom's
Specialty Foods and Svea Restaurant, all along Clark Street.</p>
<p>The museum is the hub of the neighborhood and holds exhibits, classes,
workshops and events. It also includes a genealogy center and a museum
shop.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.americanswedishinst.org">American Swedish Institute</a> in
Minneapolis</strong> . This castle-like stone mansion in south Minneapolis was
built between 1903 and 1908 as a home for Swan Turnblad, publisher of
the Svenska Amerikanska Posten.</p>
<p>In 1929, the Turnblad family donated the mansion, the newspaper and its
office building to the American Institute for Swedish Literature, Art
and Science.</p>
<p>Now called the American Swedish Institute, it offers tours and holds
exhibitions workshops, lectures and festivals year-round. It also
include the FIKA cafe and a lovely museum shop.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Other Minneapolis destinations:
<a href="http://www.ingebretsens.com/">Ingebretsen's</a> gift shop and deli on
Lake Street and, of course, IKEA, across from the Mall of America in
Bloomington. There are also IKEAs in the Chicago suburbs of Bolingbrook
and Schaumburg.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gammelgardenmuseum.org/">Gammelgarden Museum</a> <strong>in Scandia,
Minn</strong> . On 11 acres near the St. Croix River, just over the Chisago
County border, this Swedish heritage museum gives tours from May through
the third weekend in October.</p>
<p>Its name means &quot;small old farm&quot; in Swedish, and it includes five
pioneer Swedish buildings, including an 1856 log church and 1868
parsonage.</p>
<p>It offers Swedish classes and holds many special events, including
Midsommar Dag in June and Lucia Dag on the second Sunday in December.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.visitbishophill.com/historicbishophill.html">Bishop Hill</a>
in northwest Illinois</strong> . This hamlet, fifty miles southeast of the Quad
Cities, is a state historic site and national landmark village. Settled
in 1846 by Swedes seeking religious freedom, it was a communal society
before disbanding in 1861.</p>
<p>Today, much like Iowa's Amana Colonies, it's geared toward tourists,
with shops and galleries selling gifts, artisan goods and imports.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/midsommar_swedish_institute.jpg" alt="Midsommar at the American Swedish Instititute." /><p class="copyright">&copy; ASI</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The <a href="http://www.historichenrycounty.com/">Henry County Museum</a> is open
daily from May through October, and several restored colony buildings
also hold exhibits and host classes and workshops.</p>
<h3>Swedish towns</h3>
<p><strong>Lindström in Minnesota's Chisago County</strong> . This is the hub for four
Swedish towns along the U.S. 8 corridor, also known as the Vilhelm
Moberg Commemorative Trail.</p>
<p>The Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg came here in 1948 to research his
wildly popular &quot;Emigrants&quot; novels. At the edge of Lindstroöm, statues
depict his fictional characters: stoic Karl Oskar, looking forward, and
homesick Kristina, looking back.</p>
<p>The self-guided Swedish Circle tour includes the statues, the house
where Moberg stayed, historic churches and other heritage sites around
Chisago County. Guides can be picked up at the Chisago Lakes Chamber of
Commerce on Lindström's main street, 12631 Lake Blvd., 651-257-1177.</p>

Minnesota</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Mora in east-central Minnesota</strong> . Fifty miles north of Lindstrom,
Swedes settled on land near the south shores of Mille Lacs Lake. Mora is
the home of a 25-foot Dala horse, the symbol of the Dalarna province of
Sweden, and a small Swedish bell tower.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/i/lindstrom_watertower.jpg" alt="The watertower in Londstrom, MN" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The water tower in Lindstrom bids visitors "Welcome to Lindstrom" in
Swedish.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Named for Mora, Sweden, its sister city, Mora is best-known for its
annual Vasaloppet ski race. It's an American version of the
90-kilometer Swedish Vasaloppet, held since 1922 between the towns of
Mora and Salen.</p>
<p><strong>Geneva, west of Chicago.</strong> This affluent suburb on the Fox River was
settled partly by Swedes and celebrates two different Swedish Days, one
large and tourist-oriented and one smaller and more traditional.</p>
<p>The second Swedish Day, celebrated since 1911, is in Good Templar Park,
where there's a full-scale replica of a ninth-century <a href="http://www.vikingship.us/tours.htm">Viking
ship</a>. Built in Norway in 1892, it
sailed to Chicago to be an attraction at the 1893 World's Columbian
Exposition.</p>
<p>It's open for guided tours during festivals and on the third Saturday
afternoons of the month between April and October.</p>
<p><strong>Stockholm, along the Mississippi River in western Wisconsin</strong> . This
tiny village on Lake Pepin, population 66, is a favorite day trip for
Twin Citians for its bluff-side scenery, cafes and shops, including an
outpost of Ingrebretsen's.</p>
<p>It was founded in 1854 by 200 emigrants from the impoverished village of
Bjurtjärn in Varmland province. The small town museum holds a few
historical exhibits.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.doorcounty.com/newsletter/november-2018/swedish-heritage-in-door-county/">Door
Peninsula</a>
in Wisconsin</strong> . Before it became a tourist magnet, this peninsula in
Lake Michigan was the home of many fishermen and other homesteaders from
Scandinavia.</p>
<p>The Swedish contingent is most notably represented at Al Johnson's
Swedish Restaurant in Sister Bay.</p>
<h3>Language and culture</h3>
