<p>The Cornish have been good to Mineral Point.</p>
<p>In the 1830s, skilled tin miners from Cornwall, England, came to
southwest Wisconsin, replacing the rough frontiersmen whose &quot;badger&quot;
digs gave the state a nickname but the town an unsavory atmosphere.</p>
<p>&quot;They'd start fights just for entertainment,&quot; said Lisa Kreul, a
tour guide at the historic site Pendarvis. &quot;Not until the Cornish came
in 1837 did the town start to settle down.&quot;</p>
<p>They brought their families and built English-style cottages with the
local limestone. Mineral Point was a boom town, the hub of Wisconsin's
lead rush, and the Cornish worked hard, prospered and then moved on.</p>
<p>Their stone cottages were falling down by 1935, when a young local man
and a friend began restoring them, raising money by serving Cornish
teas.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Their first cottage was called Pendarvis, after an estate in Cornwall,
and it became part of a hillside complex now run by the Wisconsin
Historical Society.</p>
<p>The Southwest Wisconsin Cornish Society holds a Cornish Festival there
and around town in late September, and one year, I went to it with some
girlfriends.</p>
<p>We started out in Pendarvis' cozy, firelit Kiddleywink Pub, named
because kiddle is liquor smuggled by pirates onto the rocky Cornwall
coast, and a wink is what you had to give the bartender to get it.</p>
<p>There were tavern games to try — toad in the hole, a bean-bag game,
and shove ha'penny, played on a wooden board with washers standing in
for coins.</p>
<p>For shove ha'penny, my opponent was glass artist Ann Alderson Cabezas,
one of many artists who have found their way to Mineral Point, pop.
2,600.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a prodigal daughter; my people were miners here and left in 1905,
and here we are again, back where we belong,&quot; said Cabezas. &quot;I came
down from Madison to buy shoes at the Bargain Nook, and I came home with
a building.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mineral_point_dog.jpg" alt="The pointer in Mineral Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>In the gift shop, we bought a loaf of saffron cake, a favorite treat in
Cornwall. The Cornish acquired a taste for saffron when Phoenician
traders brought it to the British Isles, Cabezas said, and they'd trade
their tin to get it.</p>
<p>Then we went to a tent outside to listen to Harry &quot;Safari&quot; Glasson,
a folk singer from Cornwall.</p>
<p>His first song was about the miners — &quot;They had to climb 500 to 600
feet down in the dark by the light of a candle, on wet, slimy, greasy
ladders, can you imagine that?&quot; — but then he launched into bawdier
songs, and eventually we discerned a theme.</p>
<p>&quot;All these girls — the first one's pregnant, the next one's a
prostitute and this one's alcoholic,&quot; said my friend Karen. &quot;I
should ask if he's got any nice-girl songs.&quot;</p>
<p>She did, and we got &quot;Sweet Molly Malone,&quot; about a young woman who
dies of fever. Apparently, it's hard to be happy if you're a woman in
old Cornwall. Or a man, for that matter — Glasson finished the evening
with &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The next day, we filled our plates with Cornish food at Taste of Mineral
Point, put on by the town's restaurants along High Street. We tried the
lemony tea biscuits and the figgyhobbin, with caramel and whipped cream,
and the classic pasty, in which meat, potatoes and onions are enclosed
in a flaky crust.</p>
<p>But our favorites were the Red Rooster's Magwan meatballs, which tasted
Swedish to us, and Brewery Creek's blackberry rhubarb crisp, which was
more Wisconsin than Cornwall.</p>
<p>&quot;How does such a little town have such good food?&quot; wondered my
friend Cathy.</p>
<p>In the Celtic Connection shop — Cornwall was one of the seven Celtic
nations — we looked at imported kippers and brown sauce and salad
cream that saleswoman Kathy Madigan said are very popular with
customers.</p>
<p>&quot;People who have traveled in the British Isles want another taste of
what they had there,&quot; she said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mineral_point_pendarvis_tour.jpg" alt="A guide leads a group on a tour of Pendarvis in Mineral Poin" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>At Pendarvis, we listened to storyteller Craig Dunigan spin a tale about
piskies that sounded a lot like the Brothers Grimm's &quot;The Elves and
the Shoemaker,&quot; except it featured a farmer, his nosy wife and a bowl
of porridge.</p>
<p>&quot;The only moral I've been able to get out of it is that mortals
shouldn't interfere in the ways of the little people,&quot; Dunigan said.</p>
<p>The Cornish believed not only in piskies, which are good-natured elves,
but also in spriggins — &quot;horrible ugly little fellows that supposedly
guarded treasure&quot; — and tommyknockers, who live underground and
play tricks on miners.</p>
<p>&quot;Celtic people were fascinated by fairy folk,&quot; Dunigan said.</p>
<p>They also were superstitious, considering white rabbits bad luck, said
Pendarvis guide Lisa Kreul, and they left pasties for the tommyknockers
so they wouldn't steal their tools.</p>
<p>In a muslin cap and apron, Kreul gave us a tour of the small cottages,
showing us such miner's equipment as a sticking tommy, a candlestick
that served as headlamp. The first hard hat, she said, was made of two
layers of felt dipped in beeswax.</p>
<p>In 1935, she said, Edgar Hellum (&quot;the muscles&quot;) and Bob Neal (&quot;the
brain&quot;) took the first heap of crumbling stone and turned it into a
simple but unusual restaurant that restaurant reviewer Duncan Hines called &quot;a real
adventure in dining.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Neal also had a little antiques store there, and Kreul said it's likely
he changed the name of the street outside to fit it.</p>
<p>The whole town once was nicknamed Shake Rag Under the Hill, supposedly
because the miner working at the top of the hillside mine would know it
was dinnertime when the women in the cottages below waved their dish
towels.</p>
<p>Neal figured Shake Rag Street would be a better name than Hoard Street.</p>
<p>&quot;Bob changed it to Shake Rag Street because he wanted people to be
curious and drive by and see his antiques,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Tourists have loved the name ever since. The Cornish know a good story
when they hear one, and Mineral Point still is benefiting today.</p>
