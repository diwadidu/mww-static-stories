<h2>In Wisconsin's cheese country, townspeople hang on to tradition.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_glarus_signs.jpg" alt="German street signs in New Glarus." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In New Glarus, some street signs are in English and German.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the Upper Midwest, the Swiss are insignificant-in numbers. Not
many left the Old World. But the ones who did have had more success
transplanting their traditions than nearly any other immigrant group.</p>
<p>In the southwest Wisconsin town of New Glarus, Germanic platitudes
unfurl in Gothic script on the plaster of half-timbered chalets, over
window boxes overflowing with geraniums. A little baker hangs over the
doorway of the Bäckerei, where glass cases display almond-flavored
brätzeli and anise springerle cookies.</p>
<p>The sign over the town fire department reads &quot;Feuerwehrhaus,&quot; and
Railroad Street is Bahnhofstrasse.</p>
<p>In the 1840s, the Swiss canton of Glarus, southeast of Zurich, had been
hit hard by the Industrial Revolution and recession, and it couldn't
support all of its weavers and cloth printers. So it formed the Glarus
Emigration Society and sent two trustees to buy land in the New World.</p>
<p>The first 131 immigrants were desperately poor when they arrived in
1845, and at first they suffered. They weren't farmers, but they liked
the idea of owning land, and eventually they learned to grow wheat and
raise dairy cattle.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>For generations they flourished, and few of their children spoke English
before they entered kindergarten. During World War I, anti-German
sentiment made it harder to use their native dialect, but it wasn't
until the 1930s that they noticed their culture fading.</p>
<p>There's nothing more Swiss than &quot;Wilhelm Tell,&quot; the famous Schiller
drama in which a 13th-century patriot defies an Austrian tyrant during
the struggle for independence, and in 1938, the town of 2,000 started an
annual festival that featured open-air performances of the play in
German and English.</p>
<p>&quot;They realized that if they didn't act then, a lot of the old ways and
heirlooms would disappear, and they wouldn't be able to get them
anymore,&quot; said Duane Freitag of Greendale, Wis., who grew up in New
Glarus and has researched its history. &quot;After World War II, they really
got rolling.&quot;</p>
<h3>Preservation, presentation</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/o/monroe_swiss_singers.jpg" alt="Swiss Singers of Monroe." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Green County</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Wisconsin town.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>One of the projects was the Swiss Historical Village, which started with
one pioneer building in 1942 and grew into a collection of original
buildings and replicas. Guides lead visitors around the exhibit hall and
13 small buildings, including a cheese factory.</p>
<p>During Oktoberfest, master cheesemakers come to make old-style cheese in
its enormous copper vat, brought by oxen from Milwaukee in the late
1860s.</p>
<p>Then in 1962, after the local evaporated-milk plant closed, townspeople
had to change tack again.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody went into a panic, but they didn't move,&quot; Freitag says.
&quot;A lot of people were able to get jobs in Madison, and they started
paying a little more attention to tourism.&quot;</p>
<p>Alpine facades went up on the buildings downtown, along with Swiss
canton flags. In 1965, townspeople added annual performances of a play
based on the classic children's book &quot;Heidi.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_glarus_tell_dancers.jpg" alt="Dancers in the Wilhelm Tell pageant." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Over Labor Day, the Swiss of New Glarus stage a Wilhelm Tell pageant.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The tourists came, and the town prospered again. Today, it's a favorite
weekend getaway for tourists from Madison, Milwaukee and Chicago.</p>
<p>But it's not just an act put on for tourists. In New Glarus, people
regularly eat Kalberwurst, a mild veal sausage, and Landjaeger, a
jerkylike sausage that's the specialty at Ruef's Meat Market, &quot;home
of the only true Landjaegers in the country.&quot;</p>
<p>They sing in the Männerchor, play the alphorn and practice
Scherenschnitten and Fahnenschwingen, the traditional skills of
scissor-cutting and flag-throwing.</p>
<p>As New Glarus becomes a bedroom community for Madison, a smaller
proportion of its people is of Swiss descent-perhaps one-third,
estimates Swiss Historical Village board director Gail Beal, down from
as much as three-quarters 40 years ago. Luckily, she says, the new
residents have become honorary Swiss, pitching in during town events.</p>
<p>&quot;If not for the people coming in to help, we could be losing
something,&quot; she says.</p>

<h3>Old World charm</h3>
<p>Just to the south, Monroe, Wis., looks like classic Middle America, with
its magnificent 1891 Romanesque courthouse rising over a shop-lined
square. But it is Swiss, too, populated by immigrants from Canton Bern.</p>
<p>It's the capital of cheese country, with co-ops and factories fanned
out through the countryside, including North America's last Limburger
plant and the mail-order firm Swiss Colony, founded there in 1926.</p>
<p>It has its own yodeling club, and traditional Swiss arts, such as
Kerbschnitzen-still are taught at Monroe Arts Center.</p>
<p>At Baumgartner's tavern on the square, old-timers sit in the back room
playing Jass, a betting game with cards. In the front room, locals and
tourists alike buy bricks of well-aged cheese.</p>
<p>Two blocks away, they sit in the old Ratskeller in the basement of
Turner Hall, eating cheese and onion pie and sipping Huber beer, made
down the street.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_glarus_house.jpg" alt="New Glarus house inscription in German." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In New Glarus, many houses are inscribed with proverbs and construction
dates in German.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At the Historic Cheesemaking Center in the restored train depot,
there's a shrine to cheesemaking, with shelves of old Swiss harps and
the lids on which 200-pound wheels of Swiss cured.</p>
<p>In the old days, artisan cheese was made, sold and consumed within a few
miles of the cows that gave the milk-and in Monroe, it still is.</p>
<p>Emigrants from Switzerland also settled in southeast Minnesota, in the
village of Berne, and on the Wisconsin side of the Mississippi, in Alma
and Fountain City. But they were surrounded by emigrants from Norway and
other countries, and after a few generations, they melded in.</p>
<p>But in Green County, nearly everyone was Swiss, and it was easier to
keep the heritage going. Today, even the non-Swiss are happy to claim
it.</p>
<h3>Go to a festival</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/events/history-heritage/heidi-festival-38796">Heidi

<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Eat and drink</h3>
<p>This is what you want to do in this part of Wisconsin, where Old World
flavors still are favored over &quot;lite&quot; or low-fat anything. For more,
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/cheese-country-wisconsin/">Cheese country</a>.</p>
<p>In New Glarus, Wis., nearly all the restaurants serve such Swiss dishes
as roesti, hash browns made with onion and aged cheese; raclette, melted
cheese served with new potatoes; and pastetles, slices of veal, pork and
chicken in a pastry shell with mushrooms in a wine-cream sauce.</p>
<p>The Glarner Stube is intimate and atmospheric, and the New Glarus Hotel
has glassed-in balconies that make a great place for Sunday brunch.</p>
<p>Puempls, which has 1913 Napoleonic murals on its walls and dollar bills
stuck to its ceiling, is a good place to sample New Glarus craft beer,
made down the road at New Glarus Brewing Co.</p>
<p>New Glarus Bakery makes very good European and Swiss pastries, Ruef's
Meat Market turns out Old World sausages, and the Maple Leaf sells Swiss
chocolates.</p>
<p>In Monroe, Wis., Baumgartner's is famous for its cheese sandwiches,
especially the Limburger sandwich, served on rye with raw onion. At
Turner Hall, the Ratskeller serves classic Swiss fare.</p>

<p>Both serve beer made a block away at Minhas Craft Brewery, formerly
Joseph Huber Brewing Co., the second-oldest continuously operating
brewery in the nation.</p>
<h3>Visit a heritage site</h3>
<p>In New Glarus, Wis., guides take visitors on tours of the <a href="https://www.swisshistoricalvillage.org/">Swiss
Historical Village</a>, telling
stories about the community as they show a tiny pioneer cabin, a
beekeeping house, a school, a blacksmith shop, a print shop and a cheese
factory, among other buildings.</p>
<p>Two waist-high relief maps compare the steep peaks around Glarus with
the gentle hills around New Glarus. It's open daily from May through
October.</p>
<p>Also in New Glarus, the Chalet of the Golden Fleece is a replica of a
Swiss Bernese mountain chalet, built in 1937 and filled with Swiss
woodcarving, antiques and artwork. Tours are by appointment; call
608-527-2797.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.theswisscenter.org/">Swiss Center of North America</a> is
based in New Glarus and serves as a clearinghouse for Swiss and
Swiss-American heritage organizations, businesses, embassies and
consulates.</p>
<p>It has a genealogical research library and will be the permanent home of
the traveling exhibit &quot;The Sister Republics.&quot; Its Web site lists Swiss
festivals around the nation.</p>
<p>In Monroe, Wis., Turner Hall displays interesting historic memorabilia
and photos. It's two blocks south of the square at 1217 17th. Ave.,
608-325-3461.</p>
<p>The Historic Cheesemaking Center, also the visitors center, is open
daily from March to November and Thursdays-Saturdays from December to
February.</p>
