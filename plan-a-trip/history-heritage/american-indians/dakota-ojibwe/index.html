<h2>Here's what you need to know about the Upper Midwest's indigenous people.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/l/flambeau_powwow_women.jpg" alt="Women dance at the Lac du Flambeau powwow." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In every culture, powwows bring together the generations.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Wisconsin and Minnesota have two main tribes. The Ojibwe migrated from
the east along the Great Lakes, pushed by newly arrived Europeans and
other tribes.</p>
<p>With the help of guns acquired in the fur trade, they pushed the Dakota
south and west in the 18th century and replaced them in the north
woods.</p>
<p>The Dakota are thought to be descendants of the Woodland Indians who
built effigy mounds in the Upper Midwest. Today, they live in small
communities along the Minnesota and Mississippi river valleys and in
South Dakota.</p>
<p>Nationally, the Ojibwe and Dakota are the third- and fourth-largest
Indian nations.</p>
<p>Sometimes, tribal names cause confusion. The Ojibwe's name was
shortened into Chippewa by French traders, and Chippewa still is the
legal name of many bands, especially in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The name Anishinabe, or &quot;the original people,&quot; has spiritual meaning
and is what one Ojibwe calls another.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The term Ojibwe is used most often when referring to tribal culture and
tradition.</p>
<p>The term Dakota-also Lakota, on the prairies farther west-is the
tribe's own word for &quot;allies.&quot; But historically, they have been known
as the Sioux, a word thought to have come from the French-Canadian
<em>nadouessioux,</em> derived from an Ottawa
word for &quot;little snakes.&quot;</p>
<p>Although the name Sioux was meant to be derogatory, it has become
associated with courage and bravery over the years, and many Dakota,
especially elders, still bear it proudly.</p>
<p>Many non-Indians think they should use the term &quot;native American&quot; when
referring to the indigenous people of the United States, but many tribal
members prefer &quot;Indian&quot; if an umbrella term must be used.</p>
<p>In Canada, the umbrella term is &quot;aboriginal,&quot; and communities are
called &quot;first nations.&quot;</p>
<p>But since people in both countries consider themselves members of
separate nations rather than a common race, it is best to use tribal
affiliations, such as Dakota or Ojibwe, whenever possible.</p>
<h3>How the Indians lost their land</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mille_lacs_four_seasons.jpg" alt="Four Seasons Room at Mille Lacs." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>When French fur traders arrived in the Upper Midwest in the 17th
century, the land belonged to the Ojibwe, the Dakota and many other
tribes — except they did not believe land could be owned by
individuals or transferred by a piece of paper.</p>
<p>This fundamental difference in perception colored <a href="http://treatiesmatter.org/exhibit/welcome/">agreements between
Indians and Europeans</a> for
the next two centuries.</p>
<p>In the beginning, when land was plentiful, the newcomers took the high
road: The 1787 Northwest Ordinance stated, &quot;The utmost good faith shall
always be observed toward Indians; their land and property shall never
be taken from them without their consent; and in their property, rights
and liberty, they shall never be invaded or disturbed . . . &quot;</p>
<p>But when the Europeans needed land, they took it. In 1830, President
Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act shoved Indians west of the
Mississippi River and out of Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana.</p>
<p>In 1854, the Indian Appropriations Act gave Congress authority to
establish Indian reservations. In 1862, the Homestead Act unleashed a
stampede of settlers, who swarmed to Indian lands and increased pressure
for treaties.</p>
<p>By 1887, even the land Indians held on reservations seemed like too
much, and the Indian Allotment Act eliminated the rights of Indians to
hold tribal land in common.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Their reservations were taken away and exchanged for allotments of 160
acres per head of household, 80 acres for a single person.</p>
<p>Many Indians, unable to make a living, eventually sold their land to
white people. The reservation land that was left over — 90 million
acres — also was sold.</p>
<p>Between 1829 and 1833, the Winnebago (Ho-Chunk) and Potawatomi ceded
their land in southern Wisconsin. At the same time, the Menominee were
ceding eastern Wisconsin.</p>
<p>In 1837, the Santee Dakota gave up their land in western Wisconsin. The
same year, the Dakota and Ojibwe lost most of their land east of the
Mississippi. In 1851, the Dakota, under duress, signed away most of
southern Minnesota.</p>
<p>Each chief also had to sign a &quot;trader's paper,&quot; whose inflated
demands and kickbacks nearly equaled the amounts the Dakota were to
receive under the treaty.</p>
<p>This plundering was no secret at the time. As Episcopal bishop Henry
Whipple, a friend of the Dakota, later noted, &quot;The treaty is usually
conceived and executed in fraud. The ostensible parties to the treaty
are the government of the United States and the Indians; the real
parties are the Indian agents, the traders and politicians.&quot;</p>
<p>By 1854, the Ojibwe had been forced to cede most of northern Minnesota
and Wisconsin, including their sacred homeland on Madeline Island in Lake Superior.</p>

At powwows, especially traditional ones, visitors are welcome and often
encouraged to join dancers in the sacred circle.

<p>In Minnesota, the Dakota were confined to a 10-mile-wide strip south of
the Minnesota River by 1858. After the War of 1862, they lost even that
and were banished from the state.</p>
<p>Some Indians refused to go. Forcibly removed in 1840, Ho-Chunk leader
Yellow Thunder came back in 1849 and bought 40 acres in the Wisconsin
Dells, the Ho-Chunk homeland.</p>
<p>It served as a haven for the Ho-Chunk until 1875, when amendments to the
Homestead Act allowed them to file claims and resettle in the area.</p>
<p>The Dakota started drifting back to Minnesota in the 1880s, and
eventually the U.S. government purchased small reservations for them at
Prairie Island, near Red Wing; at Shakopee, just west of the Twin
Cities; and at the Upper and Lower Sioux Agencies along the Minnesota
River.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Ojibwe have much larger reservations: White Earth, in the
northwest, the largest; Red Lake, north of Bemidji; Leech Lake, around
Walker; Bois Forte, south of International Falls; Grand Portage, at the
far tip of the North Shore; Fond du Lac, west of Duluth; and Mille Lacs.</p>
<p>In northern Wisconsin, the Red Cliff, Bad River, Lac Courte Oreilles,
Lac du Flambeau and Mole Lake bands of Ojibwe have reservations, and the
St. Croix have scattered parcels.</p>
<p>In southern Wisconsin, the Stockbridge-Munsee Mohicans, Potawatomi,
Oneida and Menominee have reservations, and the Ho-Chunk have scattered
settlements.</p>
<p>The Menominee, who had built a self-sustaining timber operation on their
reservation, were targeted for termination under new federal policy in
1953 and lost their reservation in 1961.</p>
<p>In 1973, after extensive litigation, their tribal status and land were
restored.</p>
<p>Most of the reservations were turned into checkerboards when owners of
allotted land were forced to sell. Today, whenever possible, tribes buy
the land back from white owners.</p>
