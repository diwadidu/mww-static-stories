<h2>Yes, you're invited. Here's what to expect and why you should go.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/u/p/upper_sioux_women.jpg" alt="Dancers at Upper Sioux." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The "grandmas" have a special place in the family and at powwows.

<p>Until the first Bemijigamaag Powwow, many community leaders in the
northern Minnesota town of Bemidji had never been to a powwow.</p>
<p>&quot;They said, 'Oh, that's a Native American thing, that's <em>their</em>
thing,&quot; said organizer Darrell Kingbird. &quot;They said, 'I never knew
I could come to one.' &quot;</p>
<p>But the powwow's tradition of welcoming outsiders is an old one. It's
a family reunion, and the one concept central to the Ojibwe and Dakota
world view is this: We are all related.</p>
<p>So the three largest Ojibwe bands in northern Minnesota invited the
locals as well as Gov. Mark Dayton, and they came. The next year, the
bands invited the entire Minnesota Legislature to their April powwow.</p>
<p>&quot;We opened a lot of doors and healed a lot of stereotypes,&quot; Kingbird
said.</p>
<h3>Meeting the neighbors</h3>
<p>For indigenous people, a powwow-or wacipi, as the Dakota often call
them-is a social gathering, a time to greet old friends, replenish a
sense of cultural identity and show off achievements.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>For non-Indians, it's a window into a culture rich with nature-based
spirituality and symbolic meaning.</p>
<p>When Europeans arrived in the New World, it was not an untouched
wilderness. The Dakota and Ojibwe lived there and cared for the land as
stewards, not owners. For them, it already was the land of the free.</p>
<p>Their culture has much to offer. Luckily, they're happy to share.</p>
<h3>Learning to listen</h3>
<p>But it's not always easy for non-Indians to absorb the lessons.</p>
<p>A powwow can be a little like a Magic Eye puzzle: There's a swirl of
colors and a lot to look at, but it's hard for the eye to grasp the
whole picture. That is, if the eye belongs to a person whose knowledge
of Indians comes mainly from history books.</p>

At many powwows, especially smaller and traditional ones, tourists are
invited into the circle.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;It's such a different culture,&quot; says public-television producer
Barbara Wiener, who spent a year researching her documentary
&quot;Wacipi-PowWow.&quot; &quot;It's so shocking-you feel like you've
stepped into a different country.&quot;</p>
<p>At all powwows, the dancing celebrates each man and woman's artistry,
spirituality and connection to ancestors, community and family.</p>
<p>&quot;You're not just dancing for yourself, you're dancing for the stars,
the moon, the plants, the animal people and for the ones who can't
walk,&quot; says Darrell Kingbird.</p>
<p>Some powwows are competitions, with cash prizes awarded to the best
dancers and sometimes drummers. Others are traditional, more like a
family reunion.</p>
<h3>A powwow in Mankato</h3>
<p>The Mdewakanton Mah-kato Wacipi in Mankato, held every September, is a
traditional powwow, one of the most meaningful in the Midwest.</p>
<p>It honors the 38 Dakota warriors hanged nearby in 1862, still the
largest mass execution in the United States. Even today, emotions remain
raw.</p>
<p>As the afternoon sun beat down on Land of Memories Park, the drumming
began.</p>
<p>Into a circle ringed by bleachers came dancers carrying sacred eagle
staffs. Other dancers carried flags, one honoring the military veterans
who are venerated in Indian culture.</p>
<p>One of the first things visitors will notice is the many ways in which
veterans are honored. Despite their history with the U.S. government,
Indians take great pride in serving their country, and their young
people have a long record of valiant service.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The second thing they'll notice is how revered elders are, and how
treasured are the children, who are full participants in the day.</p>
<p>After the honor dancers come the men's traditional dancers, wearing
turkey-feather bustles and perhaps a bone breastplate, using a
controlled, heel-to-toe step.</p>
<p>Then came the fancy dancers, in a whirl of color and spinning leaps; the
grass dancers, with streamers swaying; and the young women in jingle
dresses.</p>
<p>It was the second year I'd attended. Even so, as I watched the
proceedings and listened hard to the voices crackling over the PA, I
could hear Sherlock Holmes' admonishment to the dim-witted Watson
echoing in my ears: &quot;You see, but you do not observe.&quot;</p>
<p>In time, says Barbara Wiener, the many facets of Indian culture reveal
themselves to those who relax their reliance on Western thinking.</p>
<p>&quot;The more powwows you go to, the more you know and the more respectful
you are in terms of listening, and if you listen, you will get it,&quot;
she says. &quot;Now, I can't imagine a summer without going to several.&quot;</p>

<h3>Powwow etiquette</h3>
<p>Like most festivals, powwows include food and craft booths and,
sometimes, children's games and learning tents.</p>
<p>The centerpiece is the Grand Entry; most are 1 p.m. Saturdays and
Sundays and 7 p.m. Saturdays. Guests should stand during the Grand Entry
and honor songs. Listen to the announcer, who will give instructions.</p>
<p>Don't enter the dance circle unless invited. When you <em>are</em> invited,
don't feel you have to dance a certain way or wear anything special;
your hosts will not judge you.</p>
<p>Refer to regalia or outfits, not &quot;costumes.&quot;</p>
<p>Don't take photos of the dancing when the announcer forbids it, and
don't  take photos of individuals without asking permission.</p>
<p>Do ask questions. Traditionally, friends and guests brought tobacco to
honor favorite dancers and ask advice from elders, and some may still
appreciate this.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Where to find a powwow</h3>
<p>Check with each nation to find out details. Often, the most specific
information will be on Facebook pages.</p>
<p>Below is a guide to some of the larger powwows. Since many of the
participants travel from a long distance, holiday weekends are a
favorite time.</p>
