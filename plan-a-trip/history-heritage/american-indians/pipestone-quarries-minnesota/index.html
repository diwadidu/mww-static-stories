<h2>For centuries, the quarries have been a sacred spot in this southwest Minnesota town.</h2>

<p>It's easy to see why the Plains Indians saw the Great Spirit at work in
a far corner of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Amid an ocean of tall grass, a fractured pile of hard red rock suddenly
erupts from the sod. It's Sioux quartzite, once sand at the edge of a
red ocean, cooked and pressed into marble-like stone over a billion
years.</p>
<p>Beneath the quartzite is a thin seam of a softer stone, a red, hardened
clay that's barely harder than a fingernail.</p>
<p>This is pipestone, mined for centuries by people of many tribes, who
carved into effigies and pipes called calumets, whose smoke carried
messages to the Great Spirit.</p>
<p>Artist George Catlin, the first European to see the quarry, recorded a
Dakota account of its origin: the Great Spirit, in the form of a large
bird, called all the tribes together and, forming a pipe from the stone,
smoked it and told all his children its stone was their flesh, and the
grounds from which it came sacred.</p>
<p>Some tribes believed the quarry was where the Great Spirit created man,
and others that he sent a flood to cleanse the Earth, and that the
pipestone is the blood that remains.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Some believed it was uncovered by the hooves of a white bison; others by
the great spirit of thunder.</p>
<p>Catlin's accounts of the rare stone engaged the imaginations of others,
too, far beyond Minnesota's borders. In 1855, Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow penned the hit poem &quot;Song of Hiawatha,&quot; mixing Iroquois
and Ojibwe legends with Victorian romanticism and setting it to the
meter of a Finnish epic poem.</p>
<p>It began, &quot;On the mountains of the prairie/On the great red pipe-stone
quarry/Gitche Manito, the mighty/He the master of life, descending/On
the red crags of the quarry/Stood erect, and called the nations/Called
the tribes of men together.&quot;</p>
<p>The 23-part poem put Pipestone on the map, drawing a stream of tourists
that never has stopped.</p>
<p>Today, the quarries are protected as part of Pipestone National Monument
and are worked only by enrolled members of tribes, in the traditional
way-by hand, after a prayer.</p>
<p>Still, there are those who treat pipestone as if it were no more sacred
than gravel.</p>
<p>As visitors turn into the monument drive, past the souvenir shop Fort
Pipestone, they see a sign-a few bucks a pound for pipestone that's
hacked out of a private lot with a backhoe.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pipestone_fort_tourists.jpg" alt="Tourists pose at Fort Pipestone souvenir shop." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>All around Pipestone, Indian culture exists cheek-by-jowl with European
culture. Across from the monument entrance, three granite boulders sit,
fragments of a 50-foot boulder carried down from Canada by a glacier.</p>
<p>These Three Maidens are considered the dwelling place of spirits who
guard the quarries, and Indians who visit often tuck offerings of
tobacco or sage into their crevices.</p>
<p>Just a few yards away, brightly colored bleachers and concession stands
surround a small pond, part of an old quartzite quarry.</p>
<p>The &quot;Song of Hiawatha&quot; pageant, first staged in 1949 by townsfolk in
fringed buckskin and braided wigs, once brought 10,000 spectators to
Pipestone over three summer weekends. In 2008, it was <a href="./do-it-now/summer/pipestone-pageant.html/">performed for the
last time</a>.</p>
<p>Before the townsfolk started putting it on, it was performed by the
eighth-grade graduating class of the Pipestone Indian Training School,
one of the boarding schools to which children were sent to
&quot;unlearn&quot; Indian language and customs.</p>
<p>The school closed in 1953, and now is Southwestern Technical College.</p>
<p>Just down Hiawatha Avenue, a giant peace-pipe sits outside the 1890
cream-brick Rock Island Depot. This is the home of the Keepers of the
Sacred Tradition of Pipemakers, who promote American Indian traditions
and public awareness of them.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Some feel pipestone should be used only for sacred purposes, by Indians.
But others, like the Keepers, feel pipestone objects are invested with
sacred meaning only when they have been blessed for ceremonial uses, and
that exposure to the traditions helps white people understand and
respect Indian culture.</p>
<p>Among those the group honors is Joe Taylor, a college-educated Santee
Dakota who spent his summers carving pipes in front of the railroad
depot and selling them up and down the aisles of trains that passed
through.</p>
<p>All paths lead eventually to Pipestone National Monument, established in
1937. There's an eight-minute slide show in the interpretive center,
and tribal artisans often demonstrate carving techniques.</p>
<p>From there, the mile-long Circle Trail leads past small operating pits
and stands of sumac, whose pithy wood is hollowed out and used as pipe
stems. Then stacks of quartzite begin to push through the earth.</p>
<p>One lone column is called Leaping Rock, from which young men proved
their valor by jumping six feet to another ledge.</p>
<p>On one mound are initials from the first official visitors, members of
the 1838 Nicollet Expedition, which produced the first accurate map of
the Upper Mississippi region.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pipestone_gargoyle2.jpg" alt="A gargoyle in Pipestone." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>&quot;This admirable hill awaits the poet and the painter, who should visit
it when the last rays of the setting sun are falling upon it,&quot;
cartographer Joseph Nicollet said of the quarry area.</p>
<p>Nearby, Inscription Rock still bears the names of pioneers who visited a
half-century later.</p>
<p>The trail continues through an arched stairway and above Winnewissa
Falls, Winnewissa being the Dakota word for &quot;jealous maiden.&quot;</p>
<p>From the other side, there's a view of a rugged profile jutting from
the quartzite-the Oracle, whom tribal shamans believed could talk.</p>
<p>This red and pink rock, as hard and grainy as the pipestone is soft and
smooth, has given the town of Pipestone a handsome downtown, with 20
quartzite buildings on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>The 1888 Historic Calumet Inn, the town meeting place since frontier
boom days, is made of it.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>So is the 1896 Leon Moore Building, whose namesake not only owned a
quarry but could sculpt its stone-the faÃ§ade includes a dozen
sandstone gargoyles, including an ogre blowing a raspberry and a jester
wrinkling his nose.</p>
<p>An 1897 stone building next door houses the Pipestone Performing Arts
Center, and around the corner is one of the most ornate buildings, its
1896 quartzite facade topped by stepped gables.</p>
<p>Once City Hall, it's now the home of the Pipestone County Museum, whose
galleries include the accouterments of white settlers and local tribes,
including items used in the movie &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; and by Civil
War soldiers from the area.</p>
<p>Upon quartzite, the pioneer culture was built, and upon pipestone, the
Indian culture.</p>
