<h2>Despite centuries of disruption, their cultures survive.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/l/flambeau_lodge.jpg" alt="Learning about Ojibwe lifestyles." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
An elder tells tourists about Ojibwe culture at Waswagoning in
Wisconsin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the 17th century, when Europeans began to flee religious and economic
oppression, the New World was not an untouched wilderness.</p>
<p>In the wooded forests beyond Lake Superior, the Dakota and Ojibwe tapped
maple trees for sugar, harvested wild rice and hunted the abundant
game.</p>
<p>Many of them cultivated crops and lived in villages, like the Europeans.
They were careful stewards of the land, reseeding rice beds and
maintaining healthy soil through controlled burns, just as state
agencies do today.</p>
<p>For the Dakota and Ojibwe, this already was the land of the free.</p>
<p>(For differences between the tribes, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/dakota-ojibwe/">Ojibwe or Chippewa, Dakota or
Sioux?</a> )</p>
<p>In daily life, they were deeply spiritual, perceiving the divine
wherever they looked-in a thunderbolt from the sky, the swoop of an
eagle, the twisted branches of an old cedar tree.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They raised children in extended family clans, imparting moral and
ethical values with subtly nuanced stories and teaching by example.
Leaders were appointed by group consensus, not to exert long-term
control but to deal with specific challenges as they arose.</p>
<p>It wasn't the European way, but the French generally respected it when
they arrived. Offering firearms, metal implements and woven blankets in
return for furs, the French made life easier, but also started a
dangerous dependence on trade goods.</p>
<p>By the time the furs ran out, the French were gone, replaced by
hard-nosed Yankees who wanted something more than furs. The Dakota and
Ojibwe had little to trade but land, and eventually, the Yankees got
nearly all of it.</p>
<p>Without land, the Dakota and Ojibwe had no means of sustaining
themselves or their culture. The tribes were set adrift in a sea of
foreigners.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/ely_hegman_pictographs.jpg" alt="Hegman Lake pictographs in Ely." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Ancient pictographs left on North Hegman Lake near Ely, Minn., are
similar to those left on Agawa Bay on the east shore of Lake Superior in
Ontario.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Assimilation vs. tradition</h3>
<p>Unlike the newly arrived Germans, Norwegians and Swedes, who set up
ethnic enclaves where they could carry on their traditions, the Indians
were expected to fade away into the general population.</p>
<p>Government agents urged them to cut their hair, wear suits and live in
single-family houses. Missionaries urged them to swap their Creator for
a different one, worshiping not in the natural world but inside a
building.</p>
<p>Starting in the 1870s, Dakota and Ojibwe children were forced to attend
boarding schools, where they were punished for speaking their own
language.</p>
<p>By the time the schools finally closed, some as late as the 1960s, the
language and stories-encoded with knowledge handed down from
generation to generation-nearly were lost.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, the U.S. government stepped up the assimilation process,
targeting relatively successful bands, such as the Menominee in
Wisconsin, for termination. On the reservation, government officials
gave young people bus money to relocate to faraway cities.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Ironically, white tourists helped preserve many of the old traditions.
The Indian Allotment Act of 1887 fragmented reservations, and much of
the land taken from the Indians was sold to white people for lake cabins
and resorts.</p>
<p>When the vacationers arrived in the summer, Indian families set up
roadside stands to sell them sweetgrass baskets, beaded moccasins and
other traditional handicrafts. To entertain them, tribal members put on
their regalia and performed in weekly powwows and dance ceremonials.</p>
<p>It was part of a hand-to-mouth existence for many until the advent of
Indian gaming in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Still, their right to continue a traditional lifestyle continues to be
challenged. In 1999, however, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed their
right to hunt, fish and gather according to the Treaty of 1837, under
which the Dakota and Ojibwe lost most of their land east of the
Mississippi.</p>
<p>&quot;People are still stunned that the treaty held up,&quot; says Charlotte
Hockings of the Lac du Flambeau community in northern Wisconsin, site of
violent protests against spear-fishing in the 1980s.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/great_hall_kaynahchiwahnung.jpg" alt="Interior of the great hall in Kay-nah-chi-wah-nung." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Kay-Nah-Chi-Wah-Nung Historical Centre on the Rainy River, a guide
tells visitors about the sacred circle.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Wisconsin, the Dakota and Ojibwe are joined by the Potawatomi and
Menominee; the Ho-Chunk, who once were called Winnebago; and two tribes
from the east, the Stockbridge Mohicans and the Oneida, once part of the
League of Iroquois.</p>
<p>Today, only 1 percent of the population of Minnesota and Wisconsin call
themselves Indians, and many non-Indians know little about them.</p>
<p>Some people, says Hockings, still think Indians are savages. Others, who
think fraud ended with the treaties long ago, think Indians should get
on with their lives.</p>
<p>Well, they're trying.</p>
<h3>Carrying on the culture</h3>
<p>For many years, Hockings and her late husband, Nick, shared their
culture at Waswagoning, an open-air site in northern Wisconsin that
guided visitors through a typical year in the life of an Ojibwe band.</p>
<p>There was a maple-sugaring site, with a birchbark kettle hanging over a
fire. There was a summer wigwam and a field for lacrosse, where boys
learned battle skills, and doubleball, which taught girls the dexterity
needed for harvesting wild rice.</p>
<p>In the forest, there was an arrow-maker's lodge, filled with the
utensils used before white traders introduced metal.</p>
<p>For many of the visitors, who knew only what they saw in Hollywood
movies, it was a revelation.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, the Four Seasons room at the Mille Lacs Indian Museum also
shows sugaring, fishing and ricing camps, and guides tell about Ojibwe
innovations, from early wildlife conservation to the first disposable
diapers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Videos show powwow dancers, and a computer translates English words into
the soft, cushioned syllables of Ojibwe. In special programs, Ojibwe
elders tell stories and teach classes in beading, weaving and other
traditional crafts.</p>
<p>Nearby, Mille Lacs-Kathio State Park holds traces of a palisaded
village, one of 19 prehistoric sites built by the ancestors of the
Mdewakanton Dakota, the &quot;people who live by the water of the Great
Spirit.&quot;</p>
<p>Once, the Dakota lived on the shores of Mille Lacs; according to Ojibwe
oral tradition, they were forced out between 1745 and 1750.</p>
<p>Not far away, at the Snake River Fur Post in Pine City, Minn., and Forts
Folle Avoine near Danbury, Wis., interpreters tell of the Ojibwe who
worked in the fur trade.</p>
<p>Ojibwe life also is represented at Grand Portage National Monument and
in Thunder Bay, Ontario, at Fort William Historical Park. Both
re-created fur posts hold traditional powwows in summer.</p>
<p>In Canada, the first nations guard their heritage at such sites as
Kay-Nah-Chi-Wah-Nung Historical Centre, an Ojibwe village on the Rainy
River where visitors can hear traditional stories, take classes and stay
in tepees.</p>
<p>In southwestern Minnesota, members of prairie tribes still quarry sacred
stone at Pipestone National Monument.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pipestone_drum_circle.jpg" alt="Drum circle at a Pipestone powwow." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The drum circle provides the heartbeat of a powwow or wacipi.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Nearby, at Jeffers Petroglyphs, their ancestors left an ancient story on
a 1,000-foot-long outcropping of hard red quartzite that once was a
place for prayer. In the interpretive center, members of prairie tribes
often come to tell stories, dance and present programs about their
culture.</p>
<p>And every weekend there's a powwow somewhere, giving non-Indians a
unique portal into the Indian world.</p>
<p>But since there is no one &quot;Indian&quot; world, it's hard to grasp
everything.</p>
<p>In the end, there is perhaps only one thing we really need to know. In
Lakota, <em>Mitakuye oyasin</em>. In Ojibwe, <em>Gakina awiya gidinawendimin</em>.</p>
<p>In English, that means we are all related.</p>
<h3>Go to a powwow or wacipi</h3>
<p>This is when band members gather to greet old friends, replenish their
sense of cultural identity and show off achievements. Traditional
powwows are more like family reunions; at competition powwows, cash
prizes are awarded.</p>
<p>At both kinds, the dancing and drumming celebrate each man and woman's
artistry, spirituality and connection to ancestors and community.</p>
<p>The centerpiece is the Grand Entry; most are 1 p.m. Saturdays and
Sundays and 7 p.m. Saturdays, but call in advance to find out for sure.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mille_lacs_wild_rice.jpg" alt="Ricing at the Mille Lacs Indian Museum." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Life-size figures show how families processed wild rice at the Mille
Lacs Indian Museum.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Guests may want to bring tobacco to honor favorite dancers, drummers, or
elders with whom they wish to talk.</p>
<p>Never enter the circle unless invited, and don't take photos when the
announcer forbids them. Refer to outfits or regalia, not &quot;costumes.&quot;
Guests should stand during the Grand Entry and honor songs.</p>
<p>One of the first things visitors will notice is the many ways in which
veterans are honored. Despite their history with the U.S. government,
<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/remarkable-and-complex-legacy-native-american-military-service-180976264/">Indians take great pride in serving their
country</a>, and their young people have a long record of valiant service.</p>

<p>In Lac du Flambeau in northern Wisconsin, weekly powwows have been
presented at the Indian Bowl since 1951.</p>

<h3>Visit heritage villages</h3>
<p>Just west of International Falls and over the border, on the Rainy River
near Emo, <a href="http://www.manitoumounds.com/visitors-centre/">Kay-Nah-Chi-Wah-Nung Historical
Centre</a> is a Canadian
National Historical Site.</p>
<p>Visitors can stay in a tepee, take handiwork classes, hear elders tell
stories and take a boat trip to see pictographs. The visitors center
includes an aquarium, exhibits and a restaurant that serves Ojibwe
food.</p>
<p>For  more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/kay-nah-chi-wah-nung/">Place of the Long Rapids</a>.</p>
<h3>Study the culture</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://www.lacduflambeauchamber.com">Lac du Flambeau</a> in northern
Wisconsin, the George W. Brown Jr. Museum and Cultural Center includes a
four-seasons diorama, a rare 18th-century dugout canoe and a 7-foot,
195-pound sturgeon speared in nearby Pokegama Lake.</p>
<p>It offers Ojibwe culture programs and craft classes year-round.</p>
<p>On the west shore of Mille Lacs in central Minnesota, <a href="http://www.mnhs.org/millelacs">Mille Lacs Indian
Museum</a> includes engaging exhibits on
Ojibwe culture and history, and there's a Trading Post next door.</p>
<p>Weekend handicrafts workshops and special events, such as storytelling
in Ojibwe, are held year-round. A powwow is held on Memorial Day.</p>
<p>In the shores of Lake Vermilion in northeast Minnesota, near Tower, the
<a href="https://www.boisforteheritagecenter.com/">Bois Forte Heritage Center</a>
includes exhibits on the history of the Ojibwe band.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/j/e/jeffers_tourists_walking.jpg" alt="Tourists on quartzite at Jeffers Petroglyphs." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Jeffers Petroglyphs in southwest Minnesota, the story of an ancient
people is carved in stone.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Near Green Bay, the <a href="https://exploreoneida.com/attractions/oneida-nation-museum/">Oneida Nation
Museum</a>,
one of the nation's oldest Indian museums, includes a traditional
Iroquois longhouse and exhibits, including one on Oneida warriors, who
had seven commissioned officers in the Revolutionary War and have served
in every U.S. military conflict since.</p>
<p>A gift shop sells contemporary Oneida and Iroquois arts.</p>
<p>In southwest Minnesota, the <a href="http://www.mnhs.org/jefferspetroglyphs">Jeffers
Petroglyphs</a> bear the story of
an ancient people. Guides lead visitors along trails to see carvings of
serpents, buffalo and stick figures, and the interpretive center holds
programs on both ancient and modern Indian traditions.</p>
<p>It's open Fridays-Sundays in May and September, daily except Tuesday
from Memorial Day to Labor Day.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/jeffers-petroglyphs/">Written in stone</a>.</p>
<p>Farther west, rangers at <a href="http://www.nps.gov/pipe">Pipestone National
Monument</a> join visitors on the Circle Trail to
talk about the cultural traditions surrounding the pipestone quarries,
still used by members of Plains tribes.</p>
<p>In the Upper Midwest Indian Cultural Center, pipemakers and other
artisans give demonstrations. It's open daily.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/pipestone/">Pipestone homage</a>.</p>
<h3>Revisit the fur trade</h3>
<p>On the shores of the Yellow River, near the St. Croix Ojibwe band
headquarters in Hertel, Wis., <a href="http://www.theforts.org">Forts Folle Avoine Historical
Park</a> re-creates a fur post and Woodland Indian
Village on the site of an 1802-1804 post.</p>
<p>Visitors can talk with interpreters on guided tours, Wednesday-Sunday
from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Special events include the Great Folle
Avoine Fur Trade Rendezvous in July.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pine_city_cat_mouse.jpg" alt="Cat and mouse game in Pine City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Kids play the game cat-and-mouse at the Snake River Fur Post in Pine
City.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the Snake River near Pine City, Minn., the re-created 1804 <a href="http://www.mnhs.org/furpost">Snake
River Fur Post</a> includes an Ojibwe
encampment, and interpreters portray the Ojibwe and metis who worked in
the fur trade. Special events include Fall Gathering in September.</p>
<p>At the northeast tip of Minnesota, <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grpo">Grand Portage National
Monument</a> re-creates a fur depot at the site of
the Kitchi Onigaming, the long portage around the Pigeon River first
marked by Indian travelers.</p>
<p>It was the nerve center of the Great Lakes fur trade until 1803, when it
was packed up and moved across the border to Thunder Bay. Costumed
interpreters lead walking tours that include an Ojibwe encampment.</p>
<p>It's open daily from Memorial Day weekend to mid-October, and the
year's biggest event is the Rendezvous and Powwow in August.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/visiting-grand-portage/">Life on the Grand
Portage</a>.</p>
<p>In Thunder Bay, <a href="http://www.fwhp.ca">Fort William Historical Park</a> takes
up where Grand Portage left off. It's a virtual Disneyland of the fur
trade, with 42 buildings, including an Ojibwe encampment, and costumed
interpreters who act the parts of real 1814 characters very
convincingly.</p>

<h3>Take a tour</h3>
<p>Two self-guided tours allow people to learn more about two of the
saddest episodes in U.S. history.</p>
<p>On the rolling byways of southwest Wisconsin, a series of roadside
markers on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/black-hawk-war-wisconsin/">Black Hawk Trail</a>
recount the last leg of Sauk leader Black Hawk's flight from federal
troops in 1832, which ended in the slaughter of his band, including many
women, children and old men, on the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>In the Minnesota River Valley, many sites mark the events of the 1862
U.S.-Dakota War of 1862.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/dakota-war-1862-minnesota/">Mourning the summer of
1862</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/minnesota-river/">River
with a past</a>.</p>
<p>On the way, don't miss the <a href="http://www.nchsmn.org/sites/treaty-site-history-center/">Treaty Site History
Center</a> in St.
Peter, on the site where the Dakota gave up 24 million acres in 1851.</p>
<p>It contains fascinating exhibits on the characters of the era and shows
copies of the &quot;trader's papers&quot; that claimed virtually all the money
the Dakota received under 1851 and 1858 treaties. It's open
Tuesday-Sunday from April through October.</p>
