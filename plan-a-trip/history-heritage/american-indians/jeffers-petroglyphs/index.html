<h2>In southwest Minnesota, the Jeffers Petroglyphs tell a dramatic but mysterious story.</h2>

<p>In the middle of farm fields, on a slab of the same Sioux quartzite that
pops out of the sod farther west at Pipestone and Blue Mound, the story
of an ancient people is written with nearly 2,000 characters.</p>
<p>They're dramatic characters — serpents of the underworld, and
thunderbirds who shoot lightening bolts from their eyes.</p>
<p>There are buffalos and stick figures and atlatls, a spear-throwing
device, but no bow and arrows, which began to replace the atlatl 1,000
years ago.</p>
<p>There are handprints, said to be the place where &quot;rock men,&quot; or
spirits, closed the rock when they emerged. These spirits, according to
Algonquian tribes, had the power to enter rock and exchange tobacco for
medicine.</p>
<p>The tales these characters tell — parables or creation stories,
perhaps — were deeply significant to the people who began making the
carvings about 5,000 years ago, and the site still is considered
powerful by their modern descendants.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Yet they're stories no one knows how to read.</p>
<p>That makes the Jeffers Petroglyphs an intriguing mystery. Even seeing
the carvings is difficult; in broad sunlight, they tend to fade into the
stone.</p>
<p>In the 1940s and '50s, this 1,000-foot-long outcropping was a hangout
for local teens, who'd drive up to it with their buddies and a case of
beer.</p>
<p>The state made it into a historic site in 1966, and in 1998, the
Minnesota Historical Society opened an interpretive center.</p>
<p>A visitor's first stop is the theater, where an eight-minute multimedia
film does no interpreting — only suggesting, via wordless images of
long-ago Indians gathering around the campfire, watching the northern
lights and stalking buffalo.</p>
<p>Outside, a path through native and replanted prairie leads to the
petroglyphs, where guides help visitors pick out the carvings,
reproduced on plaques at trail side.</p>
<p>Some are easy to recognize, such as turtles and fish, but there are also
rows of dots and circles and other irregular forms impossible to
interpret.</p>

<p>&quot;This is the holy land of Native American culture, really,&quot; said Kevin
Kallin, an archaeology student who was the guide when I visited. &quot;It's
hard to try to interpret someone else's religion. We're pretty much in
the dark about it.&quot;</p>
<p>But since the visitors center opened, said site manager Tom Sanders, the
descendants of those who etched the stone — the Arapaho, Cheyenne,
Dakota, Lakota, Shoshone, Iowa — gradually have come forward.</p>
<p>&quot;What they're telling me is, this is a prayer place,&quot; he said. &quot;The
carvings represent spirits, and they're helpful spirits. They don't go
to the Creator to pray; he's the last resort. They go to these spirits,
like Catholics with their saints.&quot;</p>
<p>But he cautions that there is no firm parallel, and that no symbol has
one meaning for everyone.</p>
<p>&quot;An Iowa (Indian)
can come and say, 'This means this,' and a Dakota may
say, 'This means that,' &quot; Sanders said. &quot;Both are true; both are
meanings given to them in a vision by the Creator.&quot;</p>
<p>As at the nearby quarries of <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/pipestone/">Pipestone</a> and the cliffs
of <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/blue-mounds-minnesota/">Blue Mounds</a>,
it's easy to see why this prairie anomaly — red, the color of life —
always has been considered a spiritual place.</p>
<p>&quot;It's this pink thing that floats in a sea of green,&quot; he says. &quot;There's
a sense that it's the center of the world, much like Stonehenge.&quot;</p>
<p>According to the tradition, the Creator left the carvings. Whoever did
them was highly motivated:  Sioux quartzite, once sand at the edge of
a red ocean that was cooked and compressed over a billion years, is among the hardest rock in the world, seemingly too hard for the
stone-tipped darts and sharpened antlers that carvers would have used.</p>
<p>When I was there, Texas A&amp;M grad student Debra Dandridge had just broken
three donated diamond-tipped drill bits in an attempt to extract samples
for her study on how lichen affects rock art: &quot;So they used something
very, very hard,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Despite the unexpected loss, Dandridge, who also had visited petroglyph
sites in Nevada, Utah and New Mexico, was delighted by the site.</p>
<p>&quot;It's fabulous,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a big storybook. The stories are
here — we just don't know how to understand them.&quot;</p>
<p>There's only one thing we know for sure: These were stories the
ancients badly wanted to tell.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Jeffers Petroglyphs in southwest Minnesota</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  It's a three-hour drive west of the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>From U.S. 14, seven miles west of Springfield, take U.S. 71 south to
County Road 10. Go three miles east, then south on County Road 2 for one
mile.</p>
<p><em>Hours:</em>  The visitors center is open Thursday through Sunday from June
through Labor Day, then Saturdays only through late October.</p>
<p>Visitors can walk out to the petroglyphs even when the visitors center
is closed. Dawn and dusk are the best times of day to see them, and
winter, when the low arc of the sun creates shadows, is the best season.</p>
<p>On sunny days, however, staff naturalists help visitors see the
petroglyphs by using a board, to cast shadow, and a mirror, to spotlight
the carvings.</p>
<p><em>Admission:</em>  $10, $8 children 5-17.</p>
<p><em>Special events:</em>  Watch for &quot;Starry Night, Prairie Night,&quot; a tour from
6 p.m. to midnight to watch the constellations and discover wildlife
(bring a flashlight).</p>
<p><em>Information:</em>  <a href="http://sites.mnhs.org/historic-sites/jeffers-petroglyphs">Jeffers
Petroglyphs</a>,
507-628-5591.</p>
<p><em>Related sites nearby:</em>  The interpretive center of <a href="http://www.nps.gov/pipe">Pipestone National
Monument</a>, an hour west, contains slabs
bearing petroglyphs carved into quartzite there, and they're much
easier to see.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/blue_mounds/index.html">Blue Mounds State
Park</a>,
just north of Luverne, features dramatic cliffs of jagged quartzite.</p>
