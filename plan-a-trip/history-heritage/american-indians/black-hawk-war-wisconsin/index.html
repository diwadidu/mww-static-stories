<p>In 1804, the clock began to tick for the Sauk and Fox tribes of southern
Wisconsin and western Illinois.</p>
<p>That year, their chiefs signed a treaty ceding their lands in exchange
for $1,000 per year in goods and the use of the land until the
government sold it to settlers.</p>
<p>Tribal councils had not authorized the sale, and the chiefs soon
regretted it, but they kept the bargain.</p>
<p>But over the years, most of the signers died. Terms and boundaries
became unclear to current chiefs. Debts to traders swallowed the small
annuities paid to the tribe, even as settlers and rival Sioux began to
squeeze Sauk hunting grounds.</p>
<p>Then, in 1829, the U.S. land office sold the land around the main Sauk
village of Saukenuk, where the Illinois town of Rock Island now stands.</p>
<p>One aging Sauk chief refused to leave the lands of his ancestors. Black
Hawk was a brilliant warrior but a gullible and unsophisticated leader.</p>
<p>Still, he was a magnet for the disaffected — whom, three years later,
he would lead into a &quot;war&quot; whose romance enhanced the political
fortunes of future presidents and governors but eventually was
recognized for the tawdry debacle it was.</p>

<h3>Remembering Black Hawk</h3>
<p>In the 1880s, a young country doctor in southwest Wisconsin began
studying the Black Hawk War, talking to witnesses, identifying skirmish
sites and cataloging artifacts strewn around the bucolic landscape in
which he lived.</p>
<p>For here, 28 years of tension and misunderstanding reached a nadir.</p>
<p>In 1832, on the strength of promises of help from other tribes and the
British, Black Hawk had led more than 1,000 followers back to their
homelands.</p>
<p>By the time he found out the promises were false, a military force of
soldiers and volunteers, including a young private named Abraham
Lincoln, had mobilized.</p>
<p>Belligerent politicians and newspaper editors called for scalps. Black
Hawk fled north and tried to surrender, but overexcited volunteers
attacked his scouts.</p>
<p>Another surrender attempt was thwarted by lack of an interpreter.
Undisciplined volunteers (Lincoln left earlier, and later ridiculed
other enlistees' claims to fame) killed, among others, an old blind
Sauk and a grieving warrior sitting on the grave of his wife.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/l/blackhawkindianchief.jpg" alt="Black Hawk painted by George Catlin." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>By the time Black Hawk's band entered Wisconsin, it was starving; by
the time it reached the high ridges and coulees of Vernon County, its
path was marked by corpses and discarded possessions.</p>
<p>This is where Dr. C.V. Porter picked up the trail. Unlike many of his
era, he was sympathetic to the Indians, and in 1930 he made a series of
roadside markers, recording the story of each site by pushing newspaper
headline type into fine concrete.</p>
<p>&quot;He didn't want the people to forget what did happen,&quot; says Vernon
County historian Judy Gates. &quot;It's a very important event in county
history, and in U.S. history.&quot;</p>
<p>But over the years, Porter's markers slid into ditches and became
surrounded by corn fields.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Vernon County Historical Society restored them and erected
shelters and explanatory plaques. For the dedication, descendants of
Black Hawk traveled from Oklahoma, where the tribe ended up.</p>
<p>Today, it's possible, with the help of a society brochure, to follow
Black Hawk's flight to the Mississippi.</p>

<h3>Pilgrimage to Wisconsin</h3>
<p>A friend and I started out one sunny September afternoon near the tiny
burg of Rising Sun, where the band camped in a ravine July 31, 1832,
followed by the militia the next night.</p>
<p>Today, contoured fields of soybeans and tobacco line the valleys, and
ridges are dotted with white steeples and farmhouses.</p>
<p>Scandinavian pioneers homesteaded here; near Coon Valley, the 400-acre
open-air museum Norskedalen keeps their traditions alive.</p>
<p>Pockets of Germans settled to the north, and Italians along the river,
in the towns of Genoa and De Soto.</p>
<p>Freed slaves came to farm in the east part of the county before the
Civil War; the son of one former Tennessee slave designed many of the
round barns for which the county is renowned. The Amish now live in the
scenic Kickapoo Valley, around Ontario, Cashton and LaFarge.</p>
<p>This hilly terrain helped Black Hawk throw off the militia, in an effort
to buy time to build rafts and escape across the Mississippi.</p>
<p>He sent 20
decoys, most of whom, according to Marker 5, were shot when they tried
to surrender. It presaged the slaughter to come.</p>

<h3>Massacre on the Mississippi</h3>
<p>On Aug. 1, the remainder of Black Hawk's band arrived at the
Mississippi. Suddenly, the armed steamboat Warrior appeared.</p>
<p>Under a white flag of truce, the Sauks approached it to surrender and
were greeted by a hail of lead. Black Hawk and a few followers headed
north, but the rest of the band elected to try to cross the river.</p>
<p>The next day was the real bloodbath: Routed from wooded islands by the
Warrior's cannons, most of the band, including women and children, were
shot or drowned.</p>
<p>Sioux sent by the whites caught up with those who had escaped and
brought back 68 scalps; Menominee and Winnebagos hunted others.</p>
<p>The &quot;battle&quot; site now is part of Black Hawk Recreation Area, which
includes campsites, a pavilion and playground on the river flats north
of De Soto.</p>
<p>A plaque there quotes Black Hawk, who later was caught by Winnebagos and
turned over to Col. Zachary Taylor and a guard named Jefferson Davis.</p>
<p>&quot;Rock River was a beautiful country,&quot; he said. &quot;I loved my towns,
my cornfields, and the home of my people. I fought for it.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Black Hawk's Trail in southwest Wisconsin</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  The Wisconsin sites are half an hour south and
southeast of La Crosse.</p>
<p><em>Maps:</em>  The <a href="http://www.vernoncountyhistory.org/">Vernon County Historical
Society</a> in Viroqua has self-guided
driving tour maps of the Black Hawk markers.</p>
<p><em>Information:</em>  For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/vernon-county-wisconsin/">Valleys of Vernon
County</a>.</p>
<p><em>Illinois sites:</em>  Near Galena, Black Hawk's band besieged the town of
Elizabeth. The town palisade has been re-recreated as the Apple River
Fort State Historic Site.</p>
