<h2>In Madelia, the Jesse James Gang met its match — again.</h2>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In September 1876, a vicious gang of outlaws came up against some
ordinary Minnesotans.</p>
<p>The outlaws came out on the short end. Twice.</p>
<p>The Civil War ended more than a decade before the James-Younger Gang
rode into Minnesota. But it was far from over in Missouri, devastated by
guerrilla warfare and still simmering with resentment.</p>
<p>Jesse and Frank James had been Confederate bushwhackers there, and they
came to Northfield to rob First National Bank.</p>
<p>It wasn't just any bank; it held the wealth of Union Gen. Benjamin
Butler, renowned for filching Confederate silver and one of the most
hated men in the South, and his son-in-law Adelbert Ames, a Union
commander during the war who had just been impeached as governor of
Mississippi.</p>
<p>&quot;Minnesota was a good place to vacation and do a little banking at the
end of a gun,&quot; says Madelia history buff Les Johnson.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But the raid quickly went wrong. A former Union sharpshooter and an
expert hunter were standing near the bank, and they grabbed rifles.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, outlaws Clell Miller and William Stiles were dead. Bob
Younger, Cole Younger and Charlie Pitts were wounded, and they fled with
Jim Younger and the James brothers.</p>
<h3>Hunting the outlaws</h3>
<p>A massive manhunt was launched, and Frank and Jesse James left the
others and eventually reached safety in Missouri. But the wounded
Youngers and Pitts had to move more slowly.</p>
<p>After two weeks, they still were in western Minnesota when, stopping at
a farm to buy food, they were recognized by the farmer's teen-age son.</p>
<p>The boy rode to Madelia and alerted townsfolk, who organized a posse and
cornered the men in a slough of the Watonwan River. A shootout ensued.</p>
<p>Northfield has been celebrating the thwarted bank raid since 1948, when
it started Defeat of Jesse James Days.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madelia_meadow_pursuit.jpg" alt="Madelia posse pursues outlaws." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's become one of the biggest and best festivals in Minnesota, with
volunteers staging several re-enactments daily outside the original bank
building and a long list of events that include a rodeo, carnival,
parade, bike tour and arts fair.</p>
<p>The farming town of Madelia, pop. 2,340, is much smaller and off the
beaten path. But in 1997, it also began to celebrate its role in the
legendary raid.</p>
<p>I've seen Northfield's re-enactments many times and always get a big
kick out of them for the same reason the events of 1876 captivated the
nation: It was drama of the highest order.</p>
<p>Madelia also stages re-enactments during its Younger Brothers Capture
festival, and one year, my friend Karen and I went to see them.</p>
<p>When we arrived in the town, women in plumed hats and men with guns
swinging from holsters were strolling past its tidy brick storefronts.</p>
<p>At noon, eight men in long linen dusters-in 1876, the bad guys wore
white-began riding slowly down Main Street. In Madelia, the locals
stage a typical robbery, like those the James brothers had been
committing for a decade, from Iowa to West Virginia.</p>
<p>But it's similar to the Northfield raid, where one of the outlaws stood
guard, shoving away a nosy local who then cried &quot;Get your guns, boys,
they're robbing the bank.&quot;</p>
<p>And as in Northfield, the Madelia outlaws escape on horseback, amid
smoking guns and the thunder of hooves.</p>

<h3>Out at the slough</h3>
<p>Madelia takes up its own story in a second re-enactment, in which
townspeople have surrounded the four outlaws in a slough and a posse of
seven men goes in to get them. Of course, the posse is called &quot;the
Magnificent Seven.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My husband coined that, and it's stuck nationwide now,&quot; said Rosie
Macbeth of Mankato, whose late husband, Rex, was the longtime narrator.
&quot;This was his baby.&quot;</p>
<p>Rosie Macbeth, dressed as an 1870s lady, was taking tickets for the
school bus that took us to the capture site, seven miles into the
countryside. There was a festive atmosphere, and a spunky 7-year-old
belted out the national anthem.</p>
<p>Lonesome Ron Affolter, King of the Valley Yodelers, took up his guitar
for a spirited set of cowboy songs, and then narrator Les Johnson took
up the microphone.</p>
<p>The outlaws, he said, had taken the train into southern Minnesota,
likely at the suggestion of William Stiles, also known as William
Chadwell, who had grown up near Faribault.</p>
<p>They bought horses and checked out banks, he said, and on Sept. 4, they
stayed at the Flanders Hotel in Madelia, where Jesse James got change
for a $50 bill. But there were too many people on the street, watching
construction.</p>
<p>So the gang decided to visit Northfield, home of the hated Ames, who
owned the mill that became Malt-O-Meal.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madelia_capture_set.jpg" alt="Capture of the Younger Brothers in Madelia." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;They decided to take their money out of the bank,&quot; Johnson said.
&quot;The boys were well-dressed, they looked proper, and they could pick up
a conversation with anybody. Still, it went wrong.&quot;</p>
<p>As he spoke, re-enactors took their places in the meadow behind him, and
shooting erupted. Pitts stood up and shot Sheriff James Glispin, then
was shot dead himself.</p>
<p>Rex Macbeth memorialized his death in his poem &quot;Ode to Charlie
Pitts&quot;: &quot;And it took five hits to kill Charlie Pitts, down in Hanska
Slough.&quot;</p>
<h3>Back to town</h3>
<p>The third part of the re-enactment was back in Madelia. The badly
wounded Youngers arrived in a hay wagon, barely upright on wood stumps.
Pitts was laid out on a cart, his shirt stained red.</p>
<p>On arrival at the wooden facade of the Flanders Hotel, one of the
Youngers wanted tobacco, and Oscar Sorbel, the boy who turned them in,
went to get him a half-cent plug.</p>
<p>&quot;The Youngers are amazed by how well-treated they are,&quot; Johnson
said. &quot;They're sure they're going to get hung at the scene. But
they're fed, clothed, guarded well and put up in the hotel.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end, one of the Youngers rose and gave an epilogue. All three
were sentenced to life imprisonment at the state prison in Stillwater,
where Bob Younger died of tuberculosis.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Cole and Jim were paroled in 1901; Jim committed suicide in 1903, but
Cole started a Wild West touring show with Frank James and lived until
1916.</p>
<p>Two Minnesota towns had accomplished in two weeks what the Pinkerton
National Detective Agency had been unable to do in two years, while
losing two agents to the murderous gang.</p>
<p>&quot;I always tell people, we spotted them, we shot 'em up and we captured
'em in an eight-hour time period,&quot; Les Johnson says. &quot;They robbed
Missouri for over 10 years. Then they came to Minnesota. They came up in
August, and Sept. 7 was the day they messed up.&quot;</p>
