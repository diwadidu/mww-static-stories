<h2>Every September, the Civil War comes to an old stagecoach inn in Wisconsin.</h2>

<p>The forest was quiet and the afternoon still. Unnaturally still.</p>
<p>Fifteen Union Army infantry units were camped around wagons in a meadow,
near artillery and cavalry. Along a split-rail fence, a drum-and-fife
corps pounded drums and blew trumpets.</p>
<p>Gunners began to load their muskets. The cavalry got on pawing horses.
Then a Union skirmish line marched down the meadow, followed by a tight
column of infantrymen.</p>
<p>On the other side of the meadow, a Confederate skirmish line exchanged
musket fire with the federals. Suddenly, more gray-uniformed soldiers
burst from the woods and attacked the heart of the Union column. The
thunder of cannons filled the air. The blue uniforms fell back.</p>
<p>Then the second-guessing began.</p>
<p>&quot;Could have won in the first 10 minutes if they'd got those first 12
men,&quot; grumbled a man on the sidelines. &quot;So much for a counter
attack,&quot; groused another.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>What year is this, anyway?</p>
<p>It's the 21st century at the Wade House in Greenbush, Wis., but 1864 to
the 1,200 Civil War hobbyists who have gathered to re-enact the attack
on Tupelo, an important rail junction in northern Mississippi.</p>
<p>The initial federal setback was temporary; the battle turned into a
stinging defeat for the Confederates, who lost 1,326 men to the Union's
674.</p>
<p>When it ended, the rebels had been kept from the federal supply lines,
and Gen. William T. Sherman was at the door to Atlanta.</p>
<p>Greenbush is no Tupelo. For the thousands of spectators gathered near
this east-central Wisconsin town to witness a part of the bloodiest war
in history, there is no blood. There is no death. There is not as much
noise as there would have been in 1864, because the muskets are firing
blanks.</p>
<p>But boy, is there atmosphere. Plenty of atmosphere.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/greenbush_confederate_horse.jpg" alt="A Confederate soldier in Greenbush." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A Confederate officer rides through the melee.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A few yards from the crowd, an artillery unit is urgently loading,
ramming, priming, and firing their lethal-looking cannon. There's a
flash, a billow of acrid white smoke and a raw boom that reverberates to
the pit of the stomach.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom! It's only aluminum foil they're stuffing down the barrel,
but the gunpowder is real, and it delivers a charge of 18,000 pounds per
square inch, enough to blow the arm off a careless loader.</p>
<p>Suddenly the Union gunners retreat, and a scruffy band of rebels takes
over the cannon. Stocky figures in blue and gray lie amid the grass. A
Civil War-era nun hovers nearby, fingering a rosary.</p>
<p>Now a column of blue uniforms emerges from the smoky fray, and the rebel
gunners retreat. A Confederate captain on a dashing black horse,
carrying a white streamer on a saber, rides to meet a Union officer;
they call a brief truce to pick up the dead and wounded.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then, the fighting continues. On the far side of the valley, a federal
cavalry unit with revolvers is rushing a Confederate unit that has
sabers drawn.</p>
<p>It's all terribly confusing, just as Civil War battles were to those
who fought in them. Here, as in the real Battle of Tupelo, Confederate
effectiveness was weakened by brigades who launched uncoordinated
assaults.</p>
<p>After the battle and military review, the soldiers retire to the vast
tent city at the bottom of the hill. The living history has just begun.
Beef stew and pippin pies are for sale, along with Dr. McGillicuddy's
cherry-bark spring beer.</p>
<p>An amputation is scheduled in the medical tent, and a blacksmith is
cranking the bellows at the Bighorn Forge. A row of sutlers sell
everything a gentleman or lady needs: carpetbags, Confederate currency,
whalebone hoops for the ladies.</p>
<p>It's expensive to be a re-enactor. A period musket with bayonet can
cost $500; an authentically reproduced uniform with hat, boots,
canteen, haversack and other accouterments can cost another $500.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/greenbush_wade_house.jpg" alt="The Wade House in Greenbush." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 1850s Wade House was a recruiting station during the Civil War.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The cost of a woman's outfit also can add up, if it's complete with
hoop, petticoats, brooch, braiding, gloves, cape, snood and plumed hat.</p>
<p>Outside the white canvas tents, Kevin Griffin of Galena, Ill., is
cleaning his rifle; he plays Thaddeus Sweeney, a fictional private in
the 10th Tennessee Volunteers.</p>
<p>&quot;No matter what they say, this is guys playing with guns and girls
playing dress-up,&quot; he says roguishly. Griffin's particular
interest â€” the Civil War, he says, is &quot;a bottomless pit of things of
interest&quot; â€” is the 11 Irish regiments in the rebel army.</p>
<p>&quot;Until the Civil War, the term Fighting Irish was an ethnic slur,&quot;
he says. &quot;They were known as good fighters; otherwise, you couldn't
trust them.&quot;</p>
<p>In a sutler's tent, Bruce Barraclough of Milwaukee is looking at
re-enactors journals and newsletters. He's a Confederate, too, an
artillery commander with Miller's Battery.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He likes guns and atmosphere, and rates the Greenbush grounds highly for
their sprawling woods and isolation from modern intrusions.</p>
<p>&quot;That gives you the ability to get lost in the era, to get your
adrenaline pumping,&quot; he says. &quot;It was rather intense out there
today.&quot;</p>
<p>So intense, says a Union major, that too many men fell down on the job
by not falling enough. Maj. Jack Grothe of St. Louis, Mo., is doing what
a staff officer does best: upbraiding his men.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody wants to be the first one out of the box, to fall over and miss
the whole thing,&quot; said Grothe, a longtime re-enactor. &quot;When we do it
for Hollywood, the cannon goes off and 10 men go down. It looks a lot
better.&quot;</p>
<p>Women too, had many roles in the Civil War; they were nurses, spies â€”
and widows.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/greenbush_girl_child.jpg" alt="Young Civil War reenactors." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Walking along a gravel path, Laurie Becker of Sussex, Wis., looks as if
she has stepped from the pages of Civil War Lady magazine; she's decked
out in a burgundy print dress with velvet cape and hat with teal and
burgundy feathers.</p>
<p>Becker plays her own great-grandmother, Catherine Elizabeth Fitzgerald
of Manitowoc, whose husband was killed at Fredericksburg, Va.</p>
<p>&quot;There are all these family stories, and I just share those,&quot; she
said. &quot;I found out about it through diaries and letters. It's amazing
how much there is out there if you dig.&quot;</p>
<p>The best re-enactors come to the best events. The Greenbush battle
re-enactment and encampment, begun in 1991, quickly garnered great
word-of-mouth, and each year it grew bigger until it was discontinued in 2023.</p>
<p>The Wade House, an 1850s stagecoach inn that was the halfway point on
the oak-plank road between Sheboygan and Fond du Lac, is one of the
smaller sites operated by the Wisconsin Historical Society.</p>
<p>But it is blessed with 280 acres of woods and fields, along with
rock-walled sunken roads that, says director Jeff Schultz, were built by
Yankee pioneers and &quot;looked like something out of Gettysburg or
Fredericksburg.&quot;</p>
<p>No Civil War battles were fought in Wisconsin. But many soldiers from
Wisconsin fought, and the Wade House once was a recruiting station; its
proprietor, Sylvanus Wade, was an avid patriot.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/greenbush_lincoln_buggy.jpg" alt="Lincoln at a Civil War event." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Re-enactor Fritz Klein is an uncanny Lincoln.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Many of the re-enactors wore the square
hats that identified them as members of three Wisconsin regiments, who,
with an Indiana unit, became known as &quot;The Iron Brigade,&quot; or, to the
rebels, &quot;the terrible Black Hats.&quot;</p>
<p>Participating in these events, says Laurie Becker, gives her a chance to &quot;shut out the
world for a weekend.&quot;</p>
<p>The re-enactors are the key to a good event, said Schultz. For as they observe
the routines of life during the Civil War, everyone else gets to observe
them.</p>
<p>&quot;For the public, it's a sideways glance at history,&quot; Schultz said.
&quot;You can smell the bacon, and see who's cooking it. It transports you
back; you feel like a time traveler.&quot;</p>
