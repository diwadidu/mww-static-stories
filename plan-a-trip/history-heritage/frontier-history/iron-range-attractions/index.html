<h2>In northern Minnesota, a rich deposit of ore brought the world running.</h2>

<p>They would have preferred gold. But the iron made them rich, too.</p>
<p>In 1865, reports of gold brought a rush of prospectors to the shores of
Lake Vermilion. What they found, instead, was red earth.</p>
<p>Those who didn't go home disappointed stayed to develop one of the
world's richest deposits of iron ore into an industry that would give
rise to dozens of towns, help the nation win two world wars and create a
distinctive piece of Minnesota's cultural fabric.</p>
<p>The first mine was on the shores of Lake Vermilion, on the end of a body
of ore that stretched from Tower to Ely. The Vermilion Range ore sat in
layers, requiring extraction from deep underground shafts.</p>
<p>Just to the south, an even larger vein lay along a wooded ridge of
hills, an exposed stretch of the Laurentian Divide that the Ojibwe
thought of as the sleeping giant, or Mesabi.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It ran nearly 120 miles, from Coleraine to Hoyt Lakes, and the soft ore
was so shallow it could be dug from open pits.</p>
<p>It produced up to a third of the world's iron ore before the high-grade
ore began to run out in the 1950s, after which lower-grade ore began to
be produced in the form of taconite pellets.</p>
<p>The thousands of unskilled jobs drew a wave of immigrants that included
Finns, Slovenes, Italians, Swedes, Croatians, Poles, Germans, Serbs and
many other nationalities, who became incorporated into the lumpy melting
pot on the Range.</p>
<p>Vestiges are apparent today, in bakeries that sell the Slovenes' walnut
potica, at halls where the Slavs' polkas are danced and at government
centers all over the Range.</p>
<p>Famous for its populist politics, the Range was profoundly influenced
by the Finns, who included longtime U.S. Communist Party secretary Gus
Hall, born Arvo Halberg in Cherry, a rural area between Hibbing and
Virginia.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/v/i/virginia_downtown.jpg" alt="Downtown Virginia on the Iron Range." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Once, nearly 400 ore pits operated on the Mesabi Range. The days when
the whole Range hummed with industry and excitement are over, but mining
still is its economic backbone.</p>
<p>Today, tourists can watch operating mines from the edge of giant pits,
and see abandoned ones from close-up. Museums recall mining's heyday,
and Ironworld in Chisholm pays fond tribute to its culture and history.</p>
<p>In Hibbing, visitors see the skeleton of a town that got in the way of
the shovels, as well as a palatial high-school paid for mining companies
and a famous bus company that began life as a mining shuttle.</p>
<p>But there is recreation, too-bicycling along the paved Mesabi Trail,
which links the attractions and towns between Grand Rapids and McKinley,
and golfing on two of the state's most scenic courses, at Giants Ridge
in Biwabik.</p>
<p>In winter, Giants Ridge is able to retain snow for alpine skiing and
cross-country ski racing longer than anywhere else in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Today, this stretch is known as the Iron Trail. One of the most
interesting stops is at its western edge, virtually in the back yard of
Calumet.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>This was the Hill Annex Mine, from which 63 million tons of ore were
taken between 1913 and 1978 on land leased from the state, which now
runs it as a state park.</p>
<p>Its centerpiece is an emerald-green lake, surrounded by birch and jack
pine and frequented by ospreys and loons. Once, it was an open pit,
where the grinding of giant shovels filled the air and explosives shook
the earth three times a day.</p>
<p>Guides drive a little trolley bus around the rim of the lake and point
out an old steam drill, blasting shacks and a 1951 electric shovel.
Gleaning usable ore left mountains of waste rock, created by running
train cars full of waste onto a high scaffold and dumping.</p>
<p>It was dirty work, and it was also dangerous, especially for the
blasters and the truck drivers who spent their days at the edge of
500-foot precipices.</p>
<p>The gaping red craters and detritus of open-pit mining are everywhere
along the Mesabi Range. Just up Minnesota 169, the towers and conveyor
belts of National Steel Pellet Co. loom over little Keewatin, giving it
the air of a rust-tinted Emerald City.</p>
<p>In Hibbing, the town was too close, so the mine moved it in 1919.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/i/hibbing_greyhounds.jpg" alt="Old buses at the Greyhound Bus Museum in Hibbing." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Greyhound Bus Museum traces the evolution of the bus line from its
start in Hibbing.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Today, all that's left of the old town are a few lampposts and street
signs in a grassy meadow at one edge of the vast Hull Rust Mahoning
Mine, the world's largest open-pit ore mine. Crawling through the red
dirt two miles away, giant dump trucks look like Matchbox cars.</p>
<p>Retired employees man the observation center at pit's edge, talking
about the Range's heyday, when mine companies made sure every church in
town was freshly painted and that schools had nothing but the best.</p>
<p>Hibbing High school, built in 1920 for nearly $4 million, is palatial
even today, with its marble, murals and chandeliers. Tours are given in
summer and during the annual Bob Dylan Days, which honor the school's
most famous alumnus.</p>
<p>A miner's shuttle made Greyhound Lines famous; a few blocks from the
high school, the Greyhound Bus Museum traces the line's evolution from
its 1914 start in Hibbing.</p>
<p>Until 2015, the Mineview in the Sky observation center in Virginia gave
visitors a look at the 3-mile-long Rouchleau mines, which started
shipping ore in 1893 and soon became one of the many Minnesota mines
swept into the financial empires of John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie
and J. Pierpont Morgan.</p>
<p>The star attraction was the giant King of the Lode, a dump truck that
was 300,000 pounds and 44 feet long. It was retired in 1998, worn out
and too expensive to overhaul: Each tire cost $29,000, and a chain
$60,000.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When the mine expanded, claiming the land under Mineview in the Sky, the
truck was cut up for scrap.</p>
<p>Another kind of mining was practiced on the Vermilion Range, where the
rich ore is in hard vertical layers of hematite. The Soudan Mine was the
first in the state when it began operating in 1884.</p>
<p>It became an underground mine in the 1890s, with a shaft that eventually
reached 2,400 feet, or seven football fields, into the earth.</p>
<p>Today, it's the Soudan Underground Mine State Park, and visitors can
take a three-minute ride in an elevator cage to the bottom, where they
get into electric trains and ride to a stope, part of a crossword-puzzle
maze of excavations created when miners drilled and blasted into
fingerlike veins.</p>
<p>It's cold and dark, and miners suffered hearing loss from the noise,
but this was considered &quot;a Cadillac&quot; of mines: Only 13 men died in
79 years.</p>
<p>There's still many tons of ore left, but excavation costs became
prohibitive. The mine closed in 1963, only four years before the closing
of the Pioneer Mine in Ely marked the end of mining on the Vermilion
Range.</p>
<p>It was a hard life. But it was one that made the people of the Range
proud.</p>
