<h2>A northwest Wisconsin resort town keeps a frontier art alive.</h2>

<p>One hundred years ago, the white-pine forests around Hayward were the
domain of a special breed of man.</p>
<p>They were swampers, sawyers and skidders. They were deckers, chainers,
undercutters and riverhogs. They were dwarfed by the colossal trees they
had to wrestle out of the forest, and their lives hung on their own
brawn, nerve and dumb luck.</p>
<p>Six days a week they worked, dawn to dusk, all winter long. In spring,
they'd roar into Hayward for whiskey and women; their brawling
earned the town a reputation reflected in a train conductor's call:
&quot;All aboard for Hayward, Hurley and Hell!&quot;</p>
<p>These strapping jacks passed into history along with the virgin forest.
Or did they?</p>
<p>I'm sitting along a dammed inlet of the Namekagon River, and next to me
is a man with the loglike arms and neck of a medieval executioner,
explaining the art of springboard chopping in a rolling Australian
brogue.</p>
<p>On a platform across the water, a burly man from New Zealand is
attacking a 14-inch-round block of white pine; :21.74 seconds later,
he's chopped through it and set a new world record.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's Hayward's annual Lumberjack World Championships, to which jacks
— and jills — from all over the world have come to compete. Not all
of them are Bunyanesque; in log-rolling and speed-climbing events,
weight is a liability, and the competitors are lithe and sinewy.</p>
<p>Hayward grows those by the dozen; this town in the middle of Chequamegon
National Forest is a log-rolling hotbed.</p>
<p>Starting as young as 3, town children spend long summer days at the
Lumberjack Bowl, splashing, playing and practicing an art that, during
log drives a century ago, left hundreds of grown men crushed or drowned.</p>
<p>The sport no longer is lethal, but it still takes cunning and stamina.
Home-grown birlers are in both title matches today; in the women's,
Judy Scheer-Hoeschler, winner of seven titles, is challenging her former
student at Hayward's Logrolling School, Tina Salzman, in a match New
Zealand announcer John Hughes bills as &quot;experience against youth.&quot;</p>
<p>They climb onto a 14-inch log and play cat and mouse, studying each
other's feet as they flash along the twirling log. Salzman falls first,
but then Hoeschler begins to falter. The two climb onto a 12-inch log
the announcer calls &quot;a little stick of dynamite&quot;; one more fall, and
Salzman is champion.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/a/hayward_lumberjacks_poles.jpg" alt="Speed climbers compete in Hayward's lumberjack championships" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>The men's contest is another battle of wits: &quot;They'll try to get in
each other's head, shake 'er up,&quot; Hughes says. Michigan's Dan
McDonough has come back to regain his title from Hayward's Brian Duffy,
who ended McDonough's seven-year winning streak.</p>
<p>But now McDonough is leaner and fitter, and soon they are furiously
spinning the log in a froth of whitewater, trying to find a crack in the
other's guard, to make a sudden feint from which there can be no
recovery.</p>
<p>One falls, then the other. Finally, McDonough topples Duffy one last
time and throws up his arms in victory.</p>
<p>The next event is the men's boom run, in which the jacks run on a
bobbing line of logs chained end to end; Tina Salzman's younger brother
J.R. wins, whipping across the water as if wolves are nipping at his
heels.</p>
<p>Wiry veteran Fred Scheer wins the river pig event over nine younger
rivals, poling a log along the boom line.</p>
<p>It's a picturesque sport — the finals are being covered by ABC, MTV
and the BBC — and sometimes a perilous one. In the preliminaries, one
of the climbers failed to break his fall in the 90-foot competition and
broke a vertebra.</p>
<p>The underhand chop, in which the jack stands on the log he's chopping,
also is dangerous; when Tina Salzman, while accepting the Ladyjack
prize, is asked whether she'll take it up, she laughs and says, &quot;No,
I'm too attached to my feet.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Her answer is eerily prophetic: A few weeks later, Carson Bosworth, with
whom she won Hayward's Jack 'n' Jill sawing competition, chopped off his big toe
in a Canadian underhand event.</p>
<p>The first world championships for log-rolling were held more than a
century ago in Omaha, Neb., and evolved into the Lumberjack World
Championships, which moved to Hayward in 1960.</p>
<p>For a town of 2,000, Hayward is the hub for an astounding number of
events: Besides the Lumberjack Championships, it's also home to the
Birkebeiner, North America's most famous Nordic ski race, and the
Chequamegon Fat Tire Festival, one of the biggest and best-known
mountain-bike races.</p>
<p>The late <a href="https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS16474">Tony
Wise</a> was the
midwife for all three events and also helped launch Scheer's Lumberjack
Shows, which Fred and Robert Scheer started as young men in 1980 and now
go all over the world from bases in Hayward and Woodruff.</p>
<p>And the town is known for even more. The 143-foot-long muskie at the
National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame is a northwoods landmark;
sometimes, weddings are been held in its open jaw, 48 feet above the
ground.</p>
<p>In the Moccasin Bar downtown, a 67½-pound muskie stretches along one
wall, along with a quirky collection of other taxidermy; the fish was a
world record when it was caught in 1949 in nearby Lac Court Oreilles.</p>
<p>Big fish, big athletes, big entrepreneurs: Hayward always has been home
to folks who have a lot of drive. No doubt, it's the legacy of the
lumberjacks.</p>
