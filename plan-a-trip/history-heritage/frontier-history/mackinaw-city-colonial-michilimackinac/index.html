<h2>On the south shore of the Mackinac Straits, the year is 1775.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinaw_soldiers.jpg" alt="British soldiers at Colonial Michilimackinac." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>At the top of the Michigan mitten, a little village has seen a lot of
action over the centuries.</p>
<p>Iroquois war parties, French explorers and British soldiers passed by on
the Mackinac Straits, which link Lake Huron to Lake Michigan. American
traders, lighthouse-builders, ore boats and tourist ferries followed.</p>
<p>Then the continent's longest suspension bridge went up, a link to the
Upper Peninsula and an attraction in itself.</p>
<p>Mackinaw City lives quietly in its shadow, supplying ferries and fudge
shops for tourists headed to the more popular Mackinac Island.</p>
<p>But it's also a destination. On its shores, there's a 1775 fort filled
with redcoats, two lighthouses, sandy beaches and a view that never gets
old: the spectacular spans of the Mighty Mac.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The biggest day of the year is Labor Day, when up to 80,000 people show
up in Mackinaw City to ride school buses to St. Ignace for the start of
the free annual walk across the Mackinac Bridge.</p>
<p>The drive across the five-mile bridge is a scenic cruise on calm days,
but it can be  a thrill ride on windy days (in 1989, a gust famously
blew a Yugo off the bridge).</p>
<p>Mackinaw is the British spelling of Mackinac, which has a silent &quot;c.&quot;
Both are shortened French versions of the Ojibwe word for round,
humpbacked Mackinac Island: Michilimackinac, or &quot;Great Turtle.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1715, the French built a fort on the south shore of the straits, in
present-day Mackinaw City. The British took it in 1761, but abandoned it
20 years later to build a more defensible fort on Mackinac Island.</p>
<p>The mainland fort was excavated and, in 1960, re-created as Colonial
Michilimackinac. Within its wooden palisades, interpreters portray the
year 1775, when the King's Eighth Regiment was posted there.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinaw_fort.jpg" alt="A soldier at Colonial Michilimackinac." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Colonial Michilimackinac, the year is 1775, and the British are in
charge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was a fur depot as well as a military post, and at any one time,
Ottawa, Ojibwe, French-Canadians, métis, Scots and German Jews could be
seen conducting business.</p>
<p>Now tourists walk the streets, wrapped by brisk breezes off the lake.
Often, they're asked to dance by one of the jolly voyageurs. If
there's a shipment of trade goods, they put on stocking caps and sashes
and help distribute them.</p>
<p>In summer, there are games of baggatiway, a kind of lacrosse. In 1763,
the Ottawa and Ojibwe, fed up with the stingy British, used the game as
a ruse, assembling outside the fort and then attacking.</p>
<p>On the parade grounds, a British sergeant gives musket-firing
demonstrations on the hour. It always draws appreciative audiences.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Imagine thousands of these going off every 20 seconds in an open
meadow; it makes a lot of smoke,&quot; he says. &quot;That's one of the reasons
the British wore red coats, so they could see each other.&quot;</p>
<p>On wet or humid days, muskets were unreliable, and he showed how troops
would &quot;set bayonet,&quot; turning their muskets into a 7-foot spear coated
in sulfur dioxide from gunpowder residue.</p>
<p>&quot;The bayonet was more feared,&quot; he says. &quot;If you were even poked in the
hand, you could die of blood poisoning.&quot;</p>
<p>In St. Anne's chapel, we witnessed a French ceremony in which visiting
priest Father Gibeault married one of the fort's Indian interpreters and
his bride from a prominent family in Detroit.</p>
<p>In 1781, during the American Revolution, the British burned the fort to
the ground and built another on Mackinac Island. After 1783, it
technically belonged to the Americans, but they were unable to take
control until a treaty in 1796.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinaw_mcgulpin.jpg" alt="McGulpin Point lighthouse in Mackinaw City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Opened in 1869, the McGulpin Point lighthouse became obsolete in 1892.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The British took it back in the first land battle of the War of 1812;
the Americans tried to recapture it but failed, regaining control only
by the passage of another treaty in 1815.</p>
<p>Colonial Michilimackinac is just one of four historic sites in Mackinaw
City.  On the other side of the bridge, the Old Point Mackinac
Lighthouse sits alongside Alexander Henry Park.</p>
<p>The lighthouse was made obsolete by the lights of the Mackinac Bridge
when it was opened in 1957. And it, in turn, had made the McGulpin Point
lighthouse obsolete when it was built in 1890.</p>
<p>McGulpin Point opened in 1869 west of town, but drew complaints because
it failed to illuminate the entire straits. It's now owned by the
county and is free to tour. Its Chi-Sin Trail leads to the water and a
54-ton rock used for centuries as a water gauge.</p>
<p>Farther west, Wilderness State Park has one of Lake Michigan's most
beautiful beaches and 26 miles of shoreline.</p>

<p>East of downtown, the Historic Mill Creek Discovery Park includes a
zipline, canopy bridge and climbing wall on the site of an 18th-century
sawmill.</p>
<p>Downtown is geared to tourists, with wide streets lined with fudge
shops, trading posts and stores selling popcorn, kites and T-shirts.</p>
<p>From early morning to late at night, ferries shuttle tourists to
Mackinac Island from three docks.</p>
<p>With all of the activity, it's hard to believe this town has a
population of only 800. For a town so small, it's got a lot to share.</p>
