<h2>Bunyan, more</h2>
<p>Paul Bunyan's legend looms large over the Northwoods. But was he a real person?</p>
<p>CHELSEY LEWIS | Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</p>
<p>Feb. 8, 2022</p>
<p>If you�ve ever driven Highway 51 through Minocqua, it�s hard to miss the giant sign with a flannel-clad lumberjack and a blue ox next to his namesake restaurant.</p>
<p>Paul Bunyan looms large over the woods of the Upper Midwest. Supposedly a giant man with superhuman strength, his legend was only embellished by his giant blue ox, Babe. But the man, the myth, the legend � which was he?</p>
<p>That�s what one reader asked What the Wisconsin? � where Journal Sentinel reporters take on questions about our state, our communities and the people in them.</p>
<p>�Was Paul Bunyan a real person or based on a real person? Why is Minnesota particularly obsessed with this legend?� the reader wanted to know.</p>
<p>The short answer is no. While some of his feats might have been based on true stories, he probably was not based on a real person, despite some sources that claim he was. And despite Minnesota being particularly infatuated with the lumberjack, his origins are in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Michael Edmonds, who retired as a director at the Wisconsin Historical Society in 2018, was curious about Paul Bunyan, too, and in 2005 began digging into the folk hero�s history.</p>
<p>What he discovered is an archetypical American story: What started as an oral tradition about a folk hero for working-class loggers grew into a man of mythical proportions that businesses sought to capitalize on.</p>
<p>The historian traveled from Massachusetts to Minneapolis trying to track down Bunyan�s origins and in 2009 published �Out of the Northwoods: The Many Lives of Paul Bunyan.� The book dispelled some previously published origin stories � including ones that traced the first stories to Maine in the mid-19th century, and the fact that they were based on a real person.</p>
<p>Who was Paul Bunyan?</p>
<p>First, a refresher on Bunyan.</p>
<p>According to legend, he was a lumberjack who worked in the forests of North America during the lumber industry�s heyday in the mid- to late 1800s.</p>
<p>Stories of his exploits were part of camp culture, with old-timers seeing how far they could string along gullible greenhorns, often making up stories on the spot as others egged them on.</p>
<p>According to the stories gathered by Wisconsin folklorist Charles Brown, which were published in pamphlets from 1922 to 1945, Bunyan stood 7 feet tall and had a 7-foot stride. He was credited with everything from creating Lake Superior � which he created as a reservoir to ice his logging roads � to the Mississippi River, created when his ox slipped and overturned a water tank.</p>
<p>His ox, Babe, weighed 5 tons and had the strength of nine horses. He originally was white but turned blue after it snowed blue for seven days and he lay down in the drifts.</p>
<p>Bunyan would strip a log by having Babe pull from one end while he pulled from the other. He and the ox once pulled an entire house and cellar up a hill.</p>
<p>One of the most famous stories is that of the Round River. According to Brown's version, Bunyan and his team once cleared 100 million feet of timber from a single 40 acres that was shaped like a pyramid, with trees growing on every side. Some men ended up with one leg shorter than the other from working on one slope all winter. In the spring, the crew floated the logs along the river for two weeks before realizing they had passed their camp a few times � the river had no outlet and circled the pyramid.</p>
<p>Was Paul Bunyan real?</p>
<p>According to a few sources, including an article on the History channel website, Bunyan was an amalgamation of two Canadian lumberjacks � Fabian Fournier, who worked in Michigan after the Civil War, and Bon Jean, a soldier in the Papineau Rebellion of 1837.</p>
<p>But Edmonds refutes these theories. He traces the Fournier theory to a 1951 letter from James MacGillivray, who wrote some of the earliest published Bunyan stories. MacGillivray claimed to have heard those Bunyan stories from a timber cruiser who worked in the same area as Fournier, and speculated they must have been based on the Saginaw, Michigan, lumberjack who was known for his strength and brawling. It was a weak link made weaker by the fact that MacGillivray wrote elsewhere that he first heard the Bunyan stories in 1887, when that timber cruiser was just a teenager and after the first stories were told in Tomahawk.</p>
<p>The Bon Jean theory was based on a 1925 book by James Stevens, who heard the story from an old Canadian logger. But when two Canadian folklorists tried to confirm the story, they couldn�t find any name resembling Bunyan in any of the archives about the rebellion. Plus, there�s no reference to Bunyan in any French-Canadian folklore.</p>
<p>Bon Jean was a French-Canadian folklore character, however, and Edmonds cites another folklorist who thinks Canadian lumberjacks brought the name with them to logging camps in the Midwest, where it evolved into the name Bunyan.</p>
<p>One-time logging town Eau Claire, Wis., is among the towns that lays claim to Paul Bunyan and Babe the blue ox, and can be seen in statues outside the Paul Bunyan Logging Camp.</p>

<p>TNS</p>
<p>Two of the first historians to gather Bunyan stories in the early 20th century also speculated he might have been based on a real person, but without much evidence to support it.</p>
<p>K. Bernice Stewart, a student at the University of Wisconsin whose father had been a timber cruiser in northern Wisconsin and Michigan, and her English professor, Homer A. Watt, gathered Bunyan stories beginning in 1914. A 1916 article published in the &quot;Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters&quot; shared their findings. They wrote:</p>
<p>�Whether Paul Bunyan lived or is as mythical as Sairey Gamp�s Mrs. Harris we have not yet succeeded in definitely finding out. All lumberjacks, of course, believe, or pretend to believe, that he really lived and was the great pioneer in the lumber country; some of the older men even claim to have known him or members of his crew. � He was probably some swamper or shacker or lumberjack more skillful and more clever than average, about whose exploits grew a series of stories; after his death, his fame probably spread from camp to camp, more tales were added to those told about him, and thus, gradually, he became in time an exaggerated type of the lumberjack, and the hero of more exploits than he could have possibly carried out in his life-time.�</p>
<p>One of the Bunyan stories the pair shares, in fact, can be traced to an actual lumberjack. According to the tale, an illiterate Bunyan ordered supplies by drawing pictures. Once he ordered grindstones but got cheese instead � a story that Edmonds traces to a real Wisconsin lumberjack in the Chippewa Valley.</p>
<p>Stewart and Watt did not investigate where the stories originated, but Edmonds found the first trustworthy mention of Bunyan stories at the Manson logging camp north of Tomahawk in the winter of 1885-'86.</p>
<p>In 1938, a retired logger told Wautoma newspaper publisher H.J. Kent how a timber cruiser named Bill Mulhollen visited the camp that winter and enraptured the men with tales of Paul Bunyan.</p>
<p>The story was supported by another account told to Kent, this one from a store clerk who worked along the road to Tomahawk and heard Bunyan stories there the following winter.</p>
<p>There�s an interesting Wisconsin twist to this origin story. Eugene Shephard, perhaps best known for creating the legendary hodag hoax, also claimed to have invented Paul Bunyan. Edmonds writes it�s possible that Mulhollen heard the Bunyan stories from Shephard, but since the latter was a �shameless liar who � plagiarized other people�s work � every statement he made in public has to be assumed false until proved otherwise.&quot;</p>
<p>But Edmonds doesn�t doubt that Shephard was nearby when those tales were first told in that logging camp, or when they were first printed, and others recalled him telling Bunyan tales.</p>
<p>And there�s an interesting connection between Shephard and that first � and only � story told by Mulhollen, which centered on Bunyan harnessing a moose to pull a sled. Shephard actually did it. In 1896, he brought in a couple moose from Canada and trained them to pull his two-wheeled carriage, then made postcards of the feat, according to Edmonds.</p>
<p>GET ANSWERS</p>
<p>What the Wisconsin?</p>
<p>Why did the raw meat cannibal sandwich become so popular in Wisconsin? And why has it stayed that way?</p>
<p>Why does Wisconsin drink so much brandy? Our love affair with the spirit � and fruity Old-Fashioneds � isn't as old as you might think.</p>
<p>Why Wisconsin's dialect, pronunciations are unique � and even vary within the state's borders</p>
<p>Where did the term 'bubbler' come from, and are we the only ones who say it?</p>
<p>Minnesota ties</p>
<p>Minnesota�s devotion to Bunyan � which includes claims to his birthplace being in Bemidji, multiple statues and even a scenic byway � could be related to when Bunyan stories made their way into print and popular culture.</p>

<p>In 1904, the Duluth News Tribune published four Bunyan tales � the first to appear in print. Ten years later, the Red River Lumber Co. in Minneapolis published 17 as part of an advertising campaign.</p>
<p>Advertising manager William Laughead wrote those Red River stories based on his own recollection from hearing them in Minnesota and California logging camps, embellished with his own inventions, including naming Bunyan�s ox Babe. Over the ensuing decades the company printed more tales that were picked up by other writers and publishers, helping make Bunyan famous across the country.</p>
<p>Bemidji's ties to Bunyan date to 1937, when the community was looking to stimulate tourism and unveiled an 18-foot statue of Bunyan and Babe at the town's winter carnival as a tribute to the area's logging history.</p>
<p>So while Minnesota cannot claim to be Bunyan�s birthplace, they can at least claim Babe�s name.</p>
<p>Wisconsin has its share of tributes to Bunyan, too, from the Cook Shanty restaurants in Minocqua and Wisconsin Dells to the 1890s replica Paul Bunyan Logging Camp at the Wisconsin Logging Museum in Eau Claire, once known as the Sawdust City for its multitude of mills at the confluence of the Chippewa and Eau Claire rivers.</p>
