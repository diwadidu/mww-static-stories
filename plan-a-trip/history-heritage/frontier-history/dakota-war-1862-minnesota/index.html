<p>In 1858, as Europe creaked under the weight of its impoverished masses,
Minnesota was a place of opportunity.</p>
<p>It had plenty of land, and newcomers who worked hard could gain social
standing as well as property, an impossibility in the old country. So
the poor surged in, thankful for a future.</p>
<p>&quot;When I consider my children, I think their futures will be very good,
yes, much better than if I had stayed in Norway,&quot; my
great-great-grandfather Rolf wrote home after his arrival in 1862.</p>
<p>America was a boon to my ancestors, who were wretchedly poor in their
native lands. There was just one snag: Someone else already lived here.</p>
<p>They were the Dakota and Ojibwe, for whom this also was the land of the
free and had been for many generations. They, too, made their living off
the land.</p>
<p>The Dakota lived around the fertile Minnesota River Valley, which
settlers coveted for farmland. Some squatted on the land, but most
settled legally, and in general, they coexisted peacefully with their
Dakota neighbors.</p>
<p>Until 1862, when the neighbors showed up at their doors with guns and
knives.</p>

<h3>Build-up to war</h3>
<p>The Sioux Uprising, as it was called, sent shock waves throughout the
frontier. For newcomers, it was a thunderbolt from the blue, but others
were not so surprised.</p>
<p>It was no secret that traders claimed nearly all of the Dakota's annual
treaty payments, much of it fraudulently. Preferential treatment of
farmer Indians and mixed-bloods over the families of traditional hunters
had divided the tightly knit community.</p>
<p>A revolving cast of political appointees managed the Dakota with callous
indifference — in the summer of 1862, when their annual payment was
delayed, a new agent refused to release provisions to the hungry Dakota
until the cash arrived.</p>
<p>Rapidly losing respect for whites, tired of being treated like children
and disgusted by the disintegration of their culture, a few young Dakota
hunters pulled the whole nation into war.</p>
<p>In a short-lived but grisly spurt of violence, they killed as many as
500 civilians, many of them women and children, yet spared whites who
had been friendly.</p>
<p>In the end, a Minnesota military commission made little distinction
between Dakota instigators and those who were forced to participate,
condemning 303 men to death.</p>
<p>President Lincoln reduced the number to 39, and on Dec. 26, 38 men —
the largest mass execution in our nation's history —were hanged in
Mankato.</p>
<p>That winter, 1,658 Dakota, many of them women and children, were
imprisoned at Fort Snelling, where at least 130 died. The survivors were
shipped to barren lands in South Dakota, where more died, and then were
sent, three years later, to a reservation in Nebraska.</p>
<p>The once-proud nation was broken.</p>

<h3>No easy answers</h3>
<p>There's nothing easy about the Sioux Uprising, which also has been
called the Dakota Conflict and the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862 as whites and
Indians alike struggle to deal with its legacy.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a really complex, messy story,&quot; says Ben Leonard, director of
the Nicollet County Historical Society, which operates Fort Ridgely.
&quot;It's not just 'The Indians and whites came together for a treaty,
America screwed the Indians, they had a war and America won.' &quot;</p>
<p>Eventually, the Dakota trickled back into Minnesota, and the U.S.
government provided small reservations, including two in the Minnesota
River Valley. Only 1.2 percent of the state's population today is
Indian, and to many, they're invisible.</p>
<p>&quot;When I ask kindergartners or first-graders if American Indians are
living today, they'll say, 'Oh no, they're gone, they all got killed
by cowboys,' &quot; Leonard says.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a really important charge when interpreting these sites,
because people are not learning it in school. There's a huge ignorance,
not just about Dakota history but about the Dakota presence, too.&quot;</p>
<p>The history I learned in school was meant to be inspirational, so it was
all about the intrepid European explorers and the hardy pioneers, many
of whom actually were well-educated entrepreneurs from the East.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>No one taught me what Leonard calls &quot;the icky history.&quot; But every
branch of my family — Norwegians, Swedes, Germans and Scots —
settled on what once was Dakota or Ho-Chunk land. I owe it to the
indigenous people to learn.</p>
<h3>Following Joseph Brown</h3>
<p>I start in Henderson, where there is a rare monument to a Dakota man —
John Otherday, a Christian farmer who helped 62 whites to safety in
1862. With his $2,500 reward, he bought a farm near Henderson.</p>
<p>But it failed, and he died on a South Dakota reservation.</p>
<p>It was hard for the Dakota to get ahead. They had to navigate a foreign,
often hostile culture, and the federal payments and incentives meant for
them ended up financing frontier development and enriching traders.</p>
<p>One of those traders was Joseph Renshaw Brown, an inventive opportunist
whose fingerprints are found throughout early Minnesota history.</p>
<p>Brown founded Henderson, and its <a href="http://jrb.hendersonmn.com/index.html">Joseph R. Brown Minnesota River
Center</a> includes a Dakota War
exhibit that asks whether tragedy could have been averted if, for
example, a proposed Northwestern Indian Territory had not been rejected
by the U.S. Senate in 1842.</p>
<p>The voices of those who have studied the era carry a hard edge.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/o/fort_ridgely.jpg" alt="Fort Ridgely historic site." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Fort Ridgely, the restored commissary building holds exhibits.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;It takes impossible naivete to believe that promises would have been
kept and the integrity of such a territory preserved,&quot; writes
historian Rhoda Gilman, as quoted in the exhibit.</p>
<p>&quot;It might have bought enough time for the Dakota . . . to adjust to the
inevitable loss of their homeland and find a means to resist short of
violent self-destruction.&quot;</p>
<p>I feel a sinking in my stomach, a queasiness that will stay with me as I
trace the history of this war. There are no good guys and no triumphs in
this story.</p>
<h3>On the road to Fort Ridgely</h3>
<p>After the 1851 Treaty of Traverse des Sioux opened the western part of
the state to settlement, Joseph Brown built a road from Henderson to
Fort Ridgely and became purveyor to the frontier.</p>
<p>Fort Ridgely, which was attacked on the third day of the war, was more
post than fort, without a stockade or even a well. But it had fearsome
artillery, and the soldiers and refugees inside were able to defend it
until troops from Fort Snelling arrived.</p>
<p>In one of the tragic ironies that run throughout the conflict, the
Dakota's gold had just arrived, two months late.</p>
<p>Today, the old commissary is a visitors center, which tells the story
with exhibits and a movie. Outside, tourists wander among the ruins of
the fort, and I met Christine Hazlett, whose home in Pennsylvania is
near Civil War battlefields.</p>
<p>She said she could understand the pain that lingers 150 years after the
war.</p>
<p>&quot;We have that between North and South back at home,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes I think, 'Gee, get on with it, forget about it,' &quot; said
her daughter, Julie. &quot;But I guess it's brought down from generation to
generation.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minnesota_river_memorial.jpg" alt="A memorial to Minnesota River Valley settlers." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A memorial along the river is "dedicated to the pioneers who settled
this valley."
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Attack at Lower Sioux Agency</h3>
<p>The Lower Sioux Agency is not far upstream. The Dakota attacked first
here, where traders had cut off credit; the body of Andrew Myrick, who
had remarked, &quot;If they are hungry, let them eat grass,&quot; was found
with the mouth stuffed with grass.</p>
<p>Today, captivating Minnesota Historical Society exhibits follow the
Dakota's story from the fur trade to the War of 1862 and beyond, to
their forced acculturation at the hands of bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Marcia and Scott Hippen of Chanhassen, Minn., had brought their six
children, and it was easy for them to draw parallels their children
could understand.</p>
<p>&quot;How would we feel if the Somalis, for example, came here and made us
wear cloths on our heads and eat their food?&quot; Marcia Hippen asked.
&quot;We'd be lost.&quot;</p>
<h3>Ruins in a lush valley</h3>
<p>The isolated gravel road that winds west from the Lower Sioux hugs the
broad, lush river plain. Overhead, rays of sun stream out of a bank of
clouds and bathe the valley in light.</p>
<p>It looks God-given — but to whom?</p>
<p>The Dakota believed the Earth was for all living things to share. The
Europeans believed it could be owned.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/u/p/upper_sioux_women.jpg" alt="Dancers at Upper Sioux." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At the Upper Sioux Community wacipi, dancers wait their turn.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At the entrance to a tidy farmhouse, I stop to read a memorial to seven
German settlers killed by the Dakota: &quot;Erected by State of Minnesota,
1915, in memory of martyrs for civilization.&quot;</p>
<p>Not far away, I see a wooden statue &quot;dedicated to the pioneers who
settled this valley.&quot;</p>
<p>And soon I reach the ruins of Joseph Brown's 19-room rose-granite home,
known as the Farther and Gay Castle, built soon after he'd left his
lucrative post as Indian agent.</p>
<p>After the war started, Dakota warriors, whose food and annuity payments
Brown had diverted to those who agreed to farm, were quick to burn it.</p>
<h3>Where the 'good' Indians lived</h3>
<p>Across the river, Terri Dinesen has managed Upper Sioux Agency State
Park for more than two decades.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very much on the Dakota side of things,&quot; she says. &quot;What if
you and I had our families put on a farm, and they didn't have
sufficient food and the game was gone, and you got so frustrated that
the U.S. government didn't hold up one single treaty promise made to
the Dakota people? We wouldn't stand for it, not when we see our
people's way of life dying.&quot;</p>
<p>Many of the Dakota who lived around Upper Sioux Agency were farmers,
derisively called &quot;cut-hairs&quot; by those who did not want to abandon
their traditional lifestyle.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minnesota_river_brown_castle.jpg" alt="Ruins of Joseph Brown's home." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>They were among the many Dakota who helped settlers escape during the
1862 war, but they too were banished.</p>
<p>I spend much of the weekend at their traditional wacipi, or powwow.
watching the dancers and listening to drums. Before I go home, I stop to
say goodbye to Dinesen.</p>
<p>As we chat, I leaf through a book by Curtis Dahlin, &quot;Dakota Uprising
Victims, Gravestones &amp; Stories.&quot; The accounts of violence against
settlers are graphic.</p>
<p>&quot;After I read it, I was mad,&quot; Dinesen admits. &quot;You get really
torn when you start looking into this story.&quot;</p>
<p>No, it's not a pretty story. Unfortunately, it's all ours.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://jrb.hendersonmn.com/index.html">Joseph R. Brown Minnesota River
Center</a> in Henderson</strong>.
Brown — fur trader, political
operative, Indian agent, newspaper editor, inventor — played an
important role in the conflict. He was fluent in Dakota and was married
to three part-Dakota women, but it's hard to tell if he was <a href="http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/destinations/state_parks/jrbrown_brochure.pdf">friend or
foe</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nchsmn.org/sites.html">Treaty Site History Center</a> in St.
