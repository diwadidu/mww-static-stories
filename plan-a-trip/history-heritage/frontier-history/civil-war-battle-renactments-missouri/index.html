<h2>After 150 years, the Civil War still haunts the western part of the state, long terrorized by jayhawkers and bushwackers.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/missouri_civil_war_battle.jpg" alt="Re-enactors stage a battle in Missouri." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Union troops flee during a reenactment in Butler, Mo.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In April 1861, the first shots of the Civil War were fired at Fort
Sumter in South Carolina.</p>
<p>The most famous battles that followed-Bull Run, Antietam,
Gettysburg, Shiloh — were in the East.</p>
<p>But after Virginia and Tennessee, the most fought-over state was
Missouri, which suffered 45 percent of all casualties.</p>
<p>Today, there's still bad blood. At battle reenactments less than four
hours from Des Moines, audiences mutter about Yankee dogs and greet
Union reenactors with stone faces.</p>
<p>To a Northerner, it's eye-opening. But perhaps more than any other
state, Missouri was scarred by the Civil War — or War Between the
States, as many call it.</p>
<p>During the sesquicentennial, along with the rest of the nation, Missouri
is reliving the trauma.</p>
<p>The war in Missouri started just eight days after Fort Sumter, when
Confederate forces seized the arsenal in Liberty, near Kansas City.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Skirmishes along its western border began six years before, as Kansas
abolitionists led by John Brown clashed with slave-owning tobacco and
hemp growers who had come from the South.</p>
<p>The first land battle of the war was fought in July 1861 in Carthage, a
Confederate victory followed by two more in the state.</p>
<p>The Union regained control of Missouri at the Battle of Pea Ridge in
March 1862, but bloody strife continued between Confederate guerrillas
and Union garrison troops.</p>
<p>To take a side was to invite revenge, but those who tried to stay
neutral were preyed upon by both sides.</p>
<p>Eventually, people simply fled. Jasper County, where the Battle of
Carthage was fought 16 days before the First Battle of Bull Run in
Manassas, Va., had 6,383 residents in 1860. By war's end, only 30
remained.</p>
<p>&quot;This area was so devastated,&quot; says Ed Robertson, a volunteer at the
Museum of Pioneer History in Bates County, one of 3½ counties evacuated
in 1863 under the notorious Order 11. &quot;People were too appalled for
years to talk about it. It was a taboo subject for a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>In some parts of western Missouri, resentment is passed down like an
heirloom. The mother of Harry Truman, born in nearby Lamar, wouldn't
sleep in the Lincoln Room after her son became president. Even today, at
battle re-enactments, Rebels leave the field to warm applause.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/u/butler_lincoln.jpg" alt="An Abraham Lincoln interpreter." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Missouri, Lincoln interpreters are not always greeted with
enthusiasm.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;There are some very strong Southern sympathies in this county,&quot;
Robertson said. &quot;There are still areas where they talk about the Yankee
dogs.&quot;</p>
<p>In western Missouri, the personal became political. It was hard to look
at abstract issues of justice and equality when your brother had been
killed by Jayhawkers from Kansas, or your house and crops confiscated by
German-speaking troops from St. Louis.</p>
<p>Residents of the area had come from the South, so their sympathies lay
there, but they became more extreme after brutal incursions by Kansas
military units.</p>
<p>&quot;(Their) conduct . . . has done more for the enemy in this state than
could have been accomplished by 20,000 of his own army,&quot; wrote Maj.
Gen. Henry Halleck to the U.S. Army commander-in-chief in December 1861.</p>
<h3>Homegrown guerrillas</h3>
<p>That's about when the infamous William Quantrill began his career.
Three months later, Halleck issued an order requiring guerrillas to be
executed upon capture. It didn't stop Quantrill, whose band of
bushwhackers, including Frank James and Cole Younger, terrorized
Missouri for the rest of the war.</p>
<p>Many of the band, unable or unwilling to resume normal lives after the
war — the 17-year-old Jesse James was shot in the leg while trying to
surrender in Lexington — carried vengeance beyond it.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Hatred for Union Gen. Benjamin Butler, nicknamed &quot;Spoons&quot; because he
liked to filch Confederate silver, may have drawn the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-shopping/">James-Younger
Gang to Northfield, Minn.</a>, in 1876.</p>
<p>Butler had $40,000 invested in the First National Bank, where his
son-in-law, a former carpet-bagging governor of Mississippi, was a
director.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a lot of hatred to get through after the war,&quot; says Terry
Ramsey, coordinator of the Bushwhacker Museum in Nevada.</p>
<p>Nevada was dubbed &quot;Bushwhacker Capital of the World&quot; by Union troops
just before they burned it to the ground. Unable to catch the
bushwhackers, Union troops simply destroyed crops, houses and anything
else that could help them.</p>
<p>To northerners, who think of the Civil War in terms of good and evil,
Missouri is an eye-opener.</p>
<p>&quot;I always say, 'Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open,' &quot; says
Minnesota historian Newell Chester, who has led tours of Civil War sites
in Missouri and other states.</p>
<p>&quot;In Mississippi, you know what you're getting into. In Gettysburg, you
know what you're getting into. But in Missouri, even with a scorecard,
you can't tell what side the players are on.&quot;</p>

<h3>The biggest battles</h3>
<p>Renactments will be held near the sites of all three of the main battles
in western Missouri.</p>
<p>In <em>Carthage</em> , the first land battle of the war was fought in July
1861, when a well-trained force of 1,100 German immigrants from St.
Louis, led by Col. Franz Sigel, clashed with the 6,000-strong Missouri
State Guard, led by pro-Southern governor Claiborne Jackson, who had
been driven from the Capitol.</p>
<p>House-to-house fighting presaged the devastation to be wrought on
civilians. It ended with a Union retreat, though Sigel lost only 13
soldiers to Jackson's 30.</p>
<p>Carthage was burned by bushwhackers in 1864. But it rebounded after the
war, thanks to its stone quarries and lead and zinc mines, and today its
streets are lined with lovely Victorian homes.</p>
<p>It once was a stop on Route 66, still marked by the Boots Motel and
Route 66 Drive Inn. Downtown, the castlelike 1895 Jasper County
Courthouse dominates a square lined with shops and cafes.</p>
<p>The Civil War Museum is nearby; it's a fine museum that tells the story
with a mural, diorama, video and exhibits. It also tells of Myra
Maebelle Shirley, an innkeeper's daughter who is said to have nursed
soldiers at that first battle.</p>
<p>Later, she was a Confederate courier and intimate of Cole Younger and
other guerrillas, and became known as Belle Starr, &quot;Outlaw Queen.&quot;</p>
<p>The next big battle site is an hour east, near Springfield. Here, in
August 1861, Brig. Gen. Nathaniel Lyon and Col. Sigel and 5,400 soldiers
attacked 12,000 men under Gen. Ben Culloch and Maj. Gen. Sterling Price
at <em>Wilson's Creek</em> .</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/greenbush_encampment_ladies.jpg" alt="A Civil War encampment." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Everyone has a role to play at the encampment.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>After six hours of fighting, Lyon's death and 1,317 casualties —
1,222 for the Confederates — the Federals withdrew.</p>
<p>One of the Rebel soldiers was Frank James; he was captured that winter,
forced to pledge allegiance to the Union and released, after which he
joined Quantrill's bushwhackers.</p>
<p>Today, the site is Wilson's Creek National Battlefield, which includes
a visitors center, a five-mile auto tour and an evocative ¾-mile walking
tour of Bloody Hill.</p>
<p>Price next headed for the prosperous Missouri River town of <em>Lexington</em>
, not far from Kansas City. Riding into town, he laid siege to 2,700
Union occupiers, fortified in the grounds of Masonic College.</p>
<p>As the garrison ran out of water, Price's army of 10,000 advanced
behind dense bales of water-soaked hemp, which repelled cannon balls.</p>
<p>The garrison surrendered, and Price became a hero throughout the South
and in Lexington, returning all but $37,000 of the $960,000 the
Federals had taken from the State Bank of Lexington.</p>
<p>Today, the Battle of Lexington State Historic Site includes the 1853
Anderson House, 100 acres of battlefield and a visitors center with
exhibits that open a fascinating window into prewar Lexington.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/u/butler_rebel_soldiers.jpg" alt="Rebel soldiers at a reenactment." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3>Slavery in the north</h3>
<p>This town, unlike its counterparts in the southwest border counties, had
a real stake in slavery: In Lafayette County, 47 percent of the
population were slaves, many used to produce hemp, a time-intensive cash
crop that withered after the war.</p>
<p>Old newspaper notices tell of slave auctions; a video with readings from
a local white woman's diary speaks of the &quot;exalted ideals&quot; and
&quot;gracious way of life&quot; shattered by the conflict.</p>
<p>Lexington was again occupied by Federals two weeks after the battle. The
next spring, in March 1862, the Union won a decisive victory at the
Battle of Pea Ridge, not far from Carthage in northwest Arkansas, and
the Confederacy took its regular troops east.</p>
<p>But for the average Missourian, the war was far from over.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Civil War in Missouri</h3>
<p>During the <a href="http://www.cedarcroft.com/cw/sched.html">sesquicentennial in
Missouri</a>, many towns and
historic sites will reenact battles.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/campjacksonboy/campjacksonguidelines">Camp Jackson: The Tipping
Point</a>
in St. Louis</strong>. The encampment in
Jefferson Barracks County Park reenact the May 1861 incidents that
tipped Missouri into the Civil War. There will be music, vignettes, a
reenactment of the capture of Camp Jackson Saturday and a general battle
reenactment Sunday.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.battleofcarthage.org/">Battle of Carthage</a></strong>, a reenactment of the July
5, 1861, battle, the first major land battle of the Civil War, with
1,200 re-enactors. In the town of Carthage, in the southwest corner of
the state.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.goboonville.com/civilwar.html">Battle of Boonville</a></strong> . This town on the
Missouri River and Katy Trail, in north-central Missouri, is reenacting
the 1861 battle on its original site.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.wilsonscreek150.com/">Battle of Wilson's
Creek</a> near Springfield.</strong>
This &quot;maximum effort&quot; reenactment
features 6,000 to 8,000 re-enactors at Wilson's Creek National
Battlefield in southwest Missouri.</p>
<p><strong>Battle of Lexington at the <a href="http://mostateparks.com/park/battle-lexington-state-historic-site">Battle of
Lexington State Historic
Site</a></strong>
, with 1,200 re-enactors. In the town of Lexington, just east of Kansas
City.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.battleofwestport.org/Tours.htm">Battle of Westport</a> : In
September 1864, Maj. Gen. Price returned to Missouri and was defeated
the next month at the Battle of Westport (now Kansas City), the largest
battle fought west of the Mississippi. A 32-mile self-guided auto tour
around Kansas City includes 25 historical markers.</p>
<p>In June, the town of Nevada holds <a href="http://www.bwdays.com/">Bushwhacker
Days</a>. There's music, carnival rides and
games, plus a 6:05 p.m. Saturday parade and historical reenactments. The
<a href="http://www.bushwhacker.org/">Bushwhacker Museum</a>, in an 1860 jail, is
open Tuesday-Saturday from May through October.</p>
