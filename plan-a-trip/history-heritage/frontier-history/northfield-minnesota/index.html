<p>Northfield always has been shaped by newcomers.</p>
<p>First the Yankees came to town, then the Norwegians. Each started a
college, and the Yankees built mills, whose flour won international
prizes as the Minneapolis mill were just getting started.</p>
<p>Missourians arrived in 1876 for a brief but memorable visit; the violent
bank raid by the James-Younger Gang is called &quot;the seven minutes that
shook Northfield.&quot;</p>
<p>But after the turn of the century, the town settled into a sedate
existence, churning out college graduates and cream.</p>
<p>Northfield's cows were butterfat champions that earned it the title
&quot;Holstein Capital of America.&quot; It was the town's &quot;contented
cows,&quot; went an advertising slogan, that produced milk for the local
Carnation plant.</p>
<p>Over time, the cows disappeared and people streamed in, drawn to the
quiet but cultured town and its old-fashioned downtown. Housing
subdivisions and big-box retailers followed the people, many of whom
commute to the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>As the town of 17,000 struggles to maintain its small-town character,
its longtime slogan — &quot;Cows, Colleges and Contentment&quot; — sounds
a little dated.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But for visitors, Northfield retains plenty of small-town charm. The big
stores are on a strip of highway, not downtown, which retains its
century-old brick storefronts and small, locally owned shops.</p>
<p>The brick Victorian tower of Old Main, St. Olaf College's first
building, still pokes above treetops at the edge of town, surrounded by
a campus of wholesome white limestone.</p>
<p>Carleton's less-lofty but decorous campus is just east of downtown,
tucked among the trees and clustered around the Bald Spot, a gathering
place.</p>
<p>Founded by the Congregational Church in 1866, Carleton soon became
independent; it's the smaller college but is rated highest in national
publications.</p>
<p>For 21 years, the late Paul Wellstone taught at the college. The
famously scrappy former wrestler taught political science, shaping a
generation of independent thinkers, before he became a U.S. senator.</p>
<p>Carleton's free public Convocation lectures bring in well-known
speakers whose exchanges with students tend to be spirited. The college
also is the alma mater of economist Thorstein Veblen, the iconoclast who
coined the term &quot;conspicuous consumption.&quot;</p>
<p>St. Olaf still is a bastion of Norwegian Lutherans, though its student
body is diverse.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/northfield_bridge_square.jpg" alt="Bridge Square in Northfield." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Bridge Square.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The college's choirs, orchestras and bands are known worldwide, and its
professional and student musicians give recitals and concerts that are
free to appreciative public audiences in hilltop concert halls.</p>
<p>Bridge Square is the heart of town and the spot at which it began. For
years, the only bridge across the Cannon River led into the square, past
the Ames flour mill on one bank and the North grist mill on the other.</p>
<p>It was across this bridge that the James-Younger Gang rode in September
1876. Adelbert Ames saw them; he had been a Union commander during the
Civil War, became the carpetbagging governor of Mississippi and had just
been impeached.</p>
<p>Ames' father-in-law, Union Gen. Benjamin Butler, was one of the most
hated men in the South.</p>
<p>He was infamous for filching Confederate silver — his nickname was
&quot;Spoons&quot; — and for his occupation of New Orleans in 1862, when
his &quot;Woman Order&quot; decreed that any local woman who insulted a Union
solder could be treated as a prostitute.</p>
<p>Around the South, his face often was featured on the bottom of chamber
pots.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He also was a major investor in Northfield's First National Bank.</p>
<p>That bank was the target of the Younger brothers and Frank and Jesse
James, who had been Confederate guerrillas during the war. On Sept. 7,
three men in long white dusters strode into First National Bank.</p>
<p>Another two men, Cole Younger and Clell Miller, slowly rode toward the
bank, and Miller took up guard at its door.</p>
<p>But a nosy local man named Joseph Allen tried to get inside; instead of
pulling him in, Miller shoved him away, whereupon Allen cried, &quot;Get
your guns, boys, they're robbing the bank.&quot;</p>
<p>A former Union sharpshooter and an expert hunter were nearby; they
grabbed rifles, and in a few minutes, Miller was dead.</p>
<p>So was William Stiles, part of a rear guard that included Jesse James
and Jim Younger. Bob Younger, Cole Younger and Charlie Pitts were
wounded.</p>
<p>&quot;These were hard-working Northerners who did not believe in such
foolishness as letting people come into their town and hold up their
bank and take their hard-earned dollars,&quot; says historian Cathy
Jackson in the PBS film &quot;Jesse James.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/northfield_shop_woman.jpg" alt="Shops in Northfield." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Division Street is lined with interesting shops and cafes.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Frank and Jesse James escaped, but Pitts was killed by a posse from the
town of Madelia, Minn., and the Younger brothers were captured and
served terms at the state prison in Stillwater.</p>
<p>Northfield became known as &quot;The Little Town That Defeated the Jesse
James Gang.&quot; Its fame came with a price: For several years, it
received anonymous threats from those who considered the gang folk
heroes.</p>
<p>The Northfield Historical Society has restored the bank office, part of
its museum in the 1868 Scriver Building, on the corner of Division
Street and Bridge Square. Visitors see the original gilt vault door and
guns used in the raid.</p>
<p>A video re-enactment shows the action inside the bank, when cashier
Joseph Lee Heywood, who refused to open the vault, was shot and killed,
reportedly by Frank James.</p>
<p>Every September, townspeople re-enact the street scenes of the famous
raid. As spectators watch from the sidelines, women and men in 1870s
garb begin to walk up and down Division Street.</p>
<p>&quot;Who could have suspected,&quot; the announcer asks, &quot;that violence
lurked just a moment away?&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then the street is filled with gunfire and the thundering of hooves.
Horses wheel and rear, and at the end, three men lie still in the street  — the two outlaws and an immigrant from Sweden who didn't understand
English.</p>
<p>The Ames Mill still stands across the river; it's now part of the
Malt-O-Meal plant.</p>
<p>Most Division Street storefronts were built just after the raid. Now,
the handsome Second Empire and Richardson Romanesque and Queen Anne
buildings that once housed hardware and department stores are the homes
of cafes and gift shops.</p>
<p>The 1877 Archer House was built a year after the raid and was a
distinctive presence on Division Street until it was destroyed by
fire in 2020.</p>
<p>The mansard-roofed hotel had housed generations of travelers and
visiting parents.</p>
<p>My friend Grace and I stayed there during a November shopping foray.
Trade from the colleges help keep Northfield's downtown healthy, and
it's filled with specialty stores.</p>

Trails wind through Carleton's Arboretum.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At Monarch, the Enchanted Garden, we perused gifts with Celtic and fairy
themes. At Sketchy Artist, I found a box of comic-book postcards.</p>
<p>We had a hard time deciding what to do next. There was a lot going on
that Saturday night: a staged reading of a new play at the Northfield
Art Guild Theater, an antique auction by the Historical Society, a
Renaissance-music concert at Carleton and, at St. Olaf, a Chekhov play
and a Javanese gamelan performance.</p>
<p>We decided to do the Gallery Crawl, starting with a reception at the
Arts Guild Gallery downtown. Then we caught the free van to an exhibit
of works by Edward Anders Sovik, the architect of the St. Olaf look —
spare but splendid, with vertical lines soaring heavenward.</p>
<p>The van already was waiting to take us to Carleton's Art Gallery. Then
we had it drop us off at the Contented Cow pub, where we ordered glasses
of ale and listened to a set of live jazz.</p>
<p>The next day, we took a hike along the Cannon River in Carleton's
Arboretum, then returned to pick up cappuccinos at Goodbye Blue Monday,
one of the few spots downtown with a collegiate atmosphere.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been wondering where all the students are,&quot; Grace said. &quot;For a
town with two colleges, you don't see that many students.&quot;</p>
<p>The colleges, several people had mentioned, keep their students busy.
With so much going on all over town, there's enough to keep visitors
busy, too.</p>
