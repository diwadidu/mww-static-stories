<h2>In the southwest Wisconsin countryside, expert reenactors bring the misery of war home.</h2>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was a gorgeous fall day in southwest Wisconsin, and all we could see
was heartache and misery.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome to Virginia 1862,&quot; read the sign at the gates of Norskedalen,
where pioneer homesteads evoke the Civil War era.</p>
<p>Pushing open the door of a chinked-timber farmhouse, we encountered
Nedda Blodgett, who was surprised to find strangers in her parlor but
quickly welcomed us in a Southern drawl.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, you must be refugees, too,&quot; she said with a nervous smile.
&quot;S'pose you're lookin' for something to eat. Ah don't have much;
those boys take about ever'thing.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;boys&quot; were Confederate troops, who were in her back yard burning
hay so advancing Union troops couldn't use it for their own horses.</p>
<p>&quot;They already know we're here; they been probin' all day,&quot; one of
them told us. &quot;And the more smoke, the more people they may think we
have.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Behind us, a tourist explained to her children that the soldiers were
taking the family's food. Blodgett quickly corrected her.</p>
<p>&quot;No, we're <em>giving</em> them our food,&quot;
she said. &quot;We leave all the dishonorable jobs to the Yankees.&quot;</p>
<p>Yankees, she said, had given her friend Becca and her friend's young
daughters half an hour to leave their home, and they'd fled to Nedda's
house. Now, Yankees were advancing on Nedda's house, too, and it was
too much for Becca.</p>
<p>&quot;I lost my house and my husband; I lost everything,&quot; she said, her
voice quavering. &quot;I'm just so fearful for my life and my children. I
do apologize for my emotional state.&quot;</p>
<p>A soldier told her to collect her valuables and flee to the farm over
the hill, so one of her daughters dashed to the stone springhouse and
came back with a jar of pickled eggs. Then, we heard a boom, and the
women and children ran out the door.</p>
<p>From a hillside, we watched as Rebels began loading, ramming, priming
and firing a cannon, whose booms resounded around the little valley.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/norskedalen_confederates_smoking.jpg" alt="Confederate re-enactors smoke around a fire at Norskedalen." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Rebels with muskets took up posts along a split-rail fence as Union
troops began streaming across a bridge, drawing gunfire as another group
of federals ran along the creek, trying to catch the enemy from behind.</p>
<p>Soon, the federals had overrun the Rebels' cannon and driven them
toward the farmhouse. The Union commander called for a ceasefire and
sent troops to check the outbuildings for Confederate sympathizers.</p>
<h3>Live theater in the countryside</h3>
<p>The re-enactment at Norskedalen, a pioneer heritage center whose name
means &quot;Norwegian valley,&quot; is modest as battle re-enactments go.
Re-enactors use only three cannons and no cavalry, because horses tear
up the grounds.</p>
<p>Some re-enactments are real spectacles. In eastern Wisconsin, the annual
battle re-enactment near the Wade House involves as many as 50 horses
and 17 cannons, which are loaded with balls of aluminum foil but use
real gunpowder that delivers a charge of 18,000 pounds per square inch,
enough to blow the arm off a careless loader.</p>
<p>Hundreds of soldiers clash on 280 acres of woods and fields, along
rock-walled sunken lanes that were built by Yankee pioneers and later
uncovered and cleared with the help of re-enactors.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In Southern states, re-enactments are held where battles actually took
place, and they're still fraught with emotion, nearly a century and a
half after the war.</p>
<p>As near as western Missouri, where counties were devastated by guerrilla
warfare, re-enactors who portray Union troops leave the field past
silent, stony-faced spectators.</p>
<p>Each re-enactment is different. Norskedalen's is more intimate, with
affecting human dramas woven into the smoke of battle.</p>
<h3>Uncomfortable authenticity</h3>
<p>As Union troops began to carry out the dead and wounded, others had to
escort weeping women away from the scene.</p>
<p>Confederate troops shuffled by, filthy and as ragged as scarecrows,
followed by a dazed Union soldier, with real blood streaming down his
face from a fall.</p>
<p>On the steps of a cabin serving as an infirmary, a wounded Rebel begged
for liquor to relieve his pain, so a Union soldier tipped a flask to his
lips. Another bellowed for &quot;the butcher&quot; (field surgeon), and in the
yard a private was joyfully reunited with his sergeant.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/norskedalen_soldiers_marching.jpg" alt="Civil War re-enactors march at Norskedalen." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Nedda Blodgett wandered out of the house, muttering over and over, &quot;Ah
just cain't get the beet juice off the wall,&quot; until a Union soldier
pulled her back. In the yard, two women laid their heads on the breast
of a dying man.</p>
<p>We watched the scene, transfixed, and with each sob and groan, we felt a
little more shell-shocked ourselves â€” as if we really were in Virginia
during 1862.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of these people are better than a professional actor, who
doesn't do as much; they live it every day,&quot; said John Thiel of nearby
St. Joseph. &quot;They practice and practice. It's really convincing. It's
really hard to get out of first person. It's part of it to portray what
people went through.&quot;</p>
<p>Thiel, who was filling in for the company surgeon, said the
verisimilitude sometimes can be a little much, especially at
demonstrations of how surgeons operated in the field.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a litter with a hole in it, and we take some chicken guts and
put the meat next to the top part of the leg,&quot; he said. &quot;We cut right
through it with a bone saw and cauterize the wound with hot metal, and
when that chicken fat starts to smoke and sputter, the kids, oh man,
they just walk away.&quot;</p>
<p>In the cabin, we met Terry Sorchy of Brodhead, Wis., who sported a black
mustache and a bushy goatee.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He wore a plaid tobacco bag around his neck, square-toed boots, a
jean-cloth suit coat woven on a 19th-century loom and pants dyed with
logwood, a tree that grows in the West Indies.</p>
<p>Even if a detail can't be seen, he said, re-enactors make sure it's
authentic.</p>
<p>&quot;If they didn't have it on them 140 years ago, we don't have it on
us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>As a Confederate Mess No. 3 infantryman (cook), Sorchy offered us a slab
of bacon bought from a local farmer and a pickled egg, dyed pink by beet
juice. It was typical fare at the time, and he was pleased when we
enjoyed them.</p>
<p>&quot;All we put in is salt,&quot; he said. &quot;Most people say, 'Ewww,' and
then they go to McDonald's on the way home, and they're putting more
preservatives and chemicals into their body than we ever do on a weekend
like this.&quot;</p>
<p>It's easy to be authentic at Norskedalen, where re-enactors stay in
pioneer cabins built during or just after the Civil War, sleeping on
real straw ticks and boiling water on cast-iron stoves.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/norskedalen_civil_war_stretcher.jpg" alt="A battle re-enactment at Norskedalen." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>&quot;Most places, they don't want you to touch anything,&quot; Thiel said.
&quot;Here, they say, 'C'mon in, use the stove.'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We love this place,&quot; said Pete Seielstad of Sparta. &quot;One lady brings
a cow, a horse and a chicken, and one guy brought in a goose. The site
is so beautiful, and 20th-century intrusions are pretty much
obliterated.&quot;</p>
<p>Seielstad and Thiel are members of Company B of the Second Wisconsin,
which was part of the famous Iron Brigade. Known to Confederate fighters
as &quot;the terrible Black Hats,&quot; it became the most honored brigade in
the eastern army, fighting at Bull Run, Antietam and Gettysburg, where
it was nearly annihilated.</p>
<p>Every October, Company B takes over Norskedalen's Bekkum Homestead, a
collection of 13 buildings from nearby Norwegian pioneer farms, and the
Holte Cabin, a Civil War-era cabin the re-enactment group helped
reconstruct on the center's grounds.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a camp-out with 100 of your most eccentric friends,&quot; Thiel said
with a smile.</p>
