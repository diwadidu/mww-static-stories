<h2>At re-created forts, meet the adventurers who shaped the Upper Midwest.</h2>

At Fort William, modern-day voyageurs take tourists for a ride in a

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Long before settlers plodded into the Upper Midwest, its rivers and
forests were swarming with a more footloose kind of entrepreneur.</p>
<p>The Pilgrims still were getting a toehold on the eastern seaboard when
Frenchman Jean Nicolet passed through the Straits of Mackinac in 1634 on
his way to Green Bay, returning to Montreal with news of a vast interior
filled with fur-bearing animals.</p>
<p>Traders wasted no time going after the pelts, and international commerce
already was brisk by the time people in Salem, Mass., were whipping
themselves into a frenzy over imagined witchcraft.</p>
<p>Profit was a powerful motivator: Scottish fur trader Alexander Mackenzie
had made his way across the continent to the Pacific a full decade
before Lewis and Clark left St. Louis, carrying a copy of Mackenzie's
travel journals.</p>
<p>There were no towns to speak of, but plenty was going on in the north
woods.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>North America's first million was made off the back of the almighty
beaver, whose pelts were called &quot;soft gold&quot; and prompted the formation
of one of the first modern corporations, complete with lobbyists,
centralized management, mergers and buyouts.</p>
<p>Men's fashion shaped the continent for the first 200 years after
Europeans penetrated its interior. High-society demand for felt top
hats, made from the barbed fur of the beaver, changed the lives of
everyone from Ojibwe hunters to the French emperor.</p>
<p>Local schoolchildren today are more likely to read about Paul Revere
than Pierre Radisson, because the French are gone, along with the Scots
and English.</p>
<p>Yet redcoats and blackrobes once roamed right in our back yard, along
with traders and a colorful cadre of voyageurs.</p>
<p>These characters live on in historical sites around the region, where
re-enactors don the scarlet waistcoats of British soldiers, the flowing
black cassocks of Jesuit priests and the striped shirts and sashes of
the French-Canadian farm boys recruited to paddle the canoes and carry
the packs.</p>

post at Grand Portage.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/grand-portage/">Grand Portage National Monument</a>
on the
northeast tip of Minnesota, costumed interpreters take visitors around a
re-created Great Hall, Ojibwe village and canoe warehouse.</p>
<p>Grand Portage was the center of the Great Lakes fur trade until 1803,
when the North West Co., run by the British, had to pack up and move
across the border, 42 miles north of present-day Thunder Bay.</p>
<p>There, they built Fort William, which the Ontario government has
re-created as <em>Fort William Historical Park.</em>  Fort William is the
continent's largest reconstructed post, with 42 buildings on 20 acres.
Interpreters go about their business as if it's just another day in
1815.</p>
<p>When I was there, we heard a dramatic quarrel in the council house over
voyageur contracts, illicit trading and the tactics of Lord Selkirk,
whose Red River colony was threatening trade; the next year, North West
Co. men massacred 22 people at the colony, and Selkirk seized Fort
William.</p>
<p>There is less drama but as much history on the Yellow River in northwest
Wisconsin, where an Ojibwe village and posts of the North West and XY
companies have been rebuilt on the spot where they stood between 1802
and 1804.</p>
<p>Today, it's <em>Forts Folle Avoine Historical Park,</em>  where costumed
interpreters lead tours of the village and posts.</p>
<p>John Sayer was the North West Co. wintering partner, and the next year,
he headed down the St. Croix River and up the Snake River to a spot near
Pine City, where he and eight voyageurs built another post.</p>
<p>That, too, has been rebuilt and is now the <em>Snake River Fur Post,</em>  run
by the Minnesota Historical Society.</p>
<p>The last time I was there, I was greeted in French by Francois Boucher,
the post's voyageur foreman, and shown around by Guillaume, a first-year
voyageur.</p>
<p>Later, I chatted with Bedowekque, a métis woman with an Ojibwe mother
and voyageur father, as she repaired moosehide moccasins.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinaw_city_fort_interpreters.jpg" alt="Interpreters at Fort Michilimackinac." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Costumed interpreters portray the year 1775 at Colonial Michilimackinac.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Sayer wasn't there; in real life, he moved on to Fort William the next
year, leaving his children and the Ojibwe wife whose family connections
had furthered his career.</p>
<p>One June, I visited another pair of fur posts on the Straits of
Mackinac, in Michigan. Everyone in the fur trade had to pass through
here, and many began their careers; John Sayer got his start working as
an apprentice clerk at Michilimackinac.</p>
<p>Michilimackinac — the name is a French corruption of an Indian word
describing Mackinac Island — was built on the south shore of the
Strait of Mackinac by the French in 1715 and taken by the British in
1761, after victory over the French in the French and Indian War.</p>
<p>Today it's been rebuilt on the same flat, sandy site, in the shadow of
the Mackinac Bridge. Within the palisades of <em>Colonial Michilimackinac,</em>
interpreters portray the year 1775, when the King's Eighth Regiment
was posted there.</p>
<p>It was a fur depot as well as a military post, and at any time Ottawa,
Ojibwe, French-Canadians, métis, Scots and German Jews could be seen on
the streets conducting business.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinaw_city_voyageurs.jpg" alt="Voyageurs at Colonial Michilimackinac." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Colonial Michilimackinac, a visiting family puts on voyageur clothes
and helps with the trade goods.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I got there during the Arrival of the Voyageurs re-enactment, as a
tourist family was donning stocking caps and sashes to help distribute
trade goods. Archaelogists were near the gardens excavating, as they
have been since 1959, and a British sergeant was giving a musket-firing
demonstration.</p>
<p>&quot;Imagine thousands of these going off every 20 seconds in an open
meadow; it makes a lot of smoke,&quot; he said. &quot;That's one of the reasons
the British wore red coats, so they could see each other.&quot;</p>
<p>On a wet day muskets were unreliable, he said, and he showed how troops
would &quot;set bayonet,&quot; turning their muskets into a 7-foot spear coated
in sulfur dioxide from gunpowder residue.</p>
<p>&quot;The bayonet was more feared,&quot; he said. &quot;If you were even poked in the
hand, you could die of blood poisoning.&quot;</p>
<p>An Ottawa interpreter explained how the coveted trade goods changed
tribal lifestyles, creating dependence on the Europeans.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In St. Anne's chapel, we witnessed a French ceremony in which visiting
priest Father Gibeault married one of the fort's Indian interpreters and
his bride from a prominent family in Detroit.</p>
<p>In 1781, during the American Revolution, the British burned the fort to
the ground and built another on Mackinac Island, which could be better
defended.</p>
<p>After 1783, it technically belonged to the Americans, but they were
unable to take control until a treaty in 1796.</p>
<p>The British took it back in the first land battle of the War of 1812;
the Americans tried to recapture it but failed, regaining control only
by the passage of another treaty in 1815.</p>
<p>After that, German immigrant John Jacob Astor ran the Great Lakes fur
trade, with increasing sophistication, until a European preference for
hats made of Chinese silk ended the era in the 1840s.</p>
<p>Today, <em>Fort Mackinac</em> sprawls along the brow of a 100-foot bluff on
Mackinac Island, high above Marquette Park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinac_soldiers_girl.jpg" alt="A little visitor marches with soldiers at Fort Mackinac." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A young recruit marches with the soldiers at Fort Mackinac on
Michigan's Mackinac Island.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The tourist era started not along after the end of the fur-trade era,
and soldiers posted on the isolated island spent most of their time
building roads, cutting wood for buildings and steamships and leasing
property for summer cottages.</p>
<p>&quot;First they came for the fur, then the fish, then fun, and now fudge,&quot; said
the interpreter manning the American Fur Company Store, one of five
historic buildings at the foot of the bluff.</p>
<p>Inside the fort's walls, soldiers in Prussian-style spiked helmets
interpret the 1880s, giving rifle-firing demonstrations and recruiting
children to join their ranks in military drills.</p>
<p>During high season, there are re-enactments of a court martial, concerts
of military music and tours of soldier life.</p>
<p>But for many tourists, the high point of a visit to Fort Mackinac is
lunch on the veranda of the Tea Room, with its dreamy view of the park,
marina and ferry traffic.</p>
<p>Other fur-trade sites are sprinkled all over the region: &quot;If it was
along a river, it was in the fur trade,&quot; says Patrick Schifferdecker,
who interprets Francois Boucher and John Sayer at Minnesota's Snake River Fur
Post.</p>

<p>In the Twin Cities, <a href="https://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling"><strong>Historic Fort
Snelling</strong></a> had one foot in the fur
trade in its early days. The <a href="https://www.mnhs.org/sibley"><strong>Sibley
House</strong></a> in Mendota is a fur-trade site; so
is Traverse des Sioux in St. Peter.</p>
<p>In truth, nearly every historical site in the region has something to do
with the fur trade. <a href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/mb/forks"><strong>The
Forks</strong></a> in downtown Winnipeg
is a lode of fur-trade history, as is the <a href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/lhn-nhs/mb/fortgarry"><strong>Lower Fort Garry National
Historic Site</strong></a> in nearby
Selkirk.</p>
<p>In Green Bay, the first permanent European settlement in the Midwest,
<a href="https://heritagehillgb.org/"><strong>Heritage Hill State Historical Park</strong></a>
preserves fur-trader cabins and a Jesuit chapel.</p>
<p>Madeline Island was a fur-trade center; in La Pointe, the <a href="https://madelineislandmuseum.wisconsinhistory.org/"><strong>Madeline
Island Historical
Museum</strong></a> has
excellent exhibits on the fur trade.</p>
<p>The Mississippi river flats of Prairie du Chien were considered the hub
of Upper Mississippi trade by three nations. It was the site of
Wisconsin's only War of 1812 battle, re-enacted yearly on the grounds of
<a href="https://villalouis.wisconsinhistory.org/"><strong>Villa Louis</strong></a>, built with
the fur-trade profits of Wisconsin's first millionaire.</p>
<p>In summer, fur-trade rendezvous and interpretive programs are in full
swing. It's the kind of history people can really sink their teeth into.</p>
