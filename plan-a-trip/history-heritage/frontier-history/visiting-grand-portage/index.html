<h2>Once, a corner of northeast Minnesota was the center of the fur-trade universe.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_portage2.jpg" alt="Stockade at Grand Portage." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The post at Grand Portage was a hub of the world's fur trade.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Long before Minnesota existed, Grand Portage was as familiar a name to
many Europeans as George Washington.</p>
<p>As the American Revolution drew to a close in the East, traders at this
Lake Superior outpost were busy minting the interior's first
millionaires.</p>
<p>It was the crossroads of a continent, the place where voyageurs laden
with goods from Montreal met voyageurs laden with beaver pelts from the
Canadian wilderness.</p>
<p>Then, it was time for Rendezvous, where the French-Canadian paddlers cut
loose while their Scottish bosses traded-making money hand over fist
for shareholders of the North West Co., one of the first modern
corporations.</p>
<p>&quot;It was making a profit of $1.7 million in our money today,&quot; says
Grand Portage National Monument ranger Steve Veit. &quot;It was the first
business operated on an intercontinental basis.&quot;</p>
<p>Its product was the lowly beaver, whose barbed fur could be turned into
the felt top hats coveted by Europe's high society.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The pelts were called &quot;soft gold,&quot; and North West collected them using
such practices as centralized management, branch offices, customer
assurance, market surveys and mergers.</p>
<p>In 1793, its best year, 182,000 pelts came through Grand Portage.</p>
<p>&quot;In its heyday, people on the streets of London knew where Grand
Portage was,&quot; says Pam Neil, chief of interpretation. &quot;It was that
important.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, no one wears top hats or owns stock in the fur trade, so Neil has
to explain.</p>
<p>&quot;When I say it's like Microsoft, people automatically understand
that,&quot; she says. &quot;And there were 120 posts between here and modern-day
British Columbia, so if I say it's like Wal-Mart, they get it every
time. That's the level these guys were operating on.&quot;</p>
<h3>Work horses of the fur trade</h3>
<p>For the voyageurs who actually did the work, the wilderness was one big
sweatshop. They worked 12 to 14 hours a day, subsisting on dried corn,
pemmican, peas, grease and salt pork.</p>
<p>The <em>mangeurs du lard</em>, or pork eaters,
paddled up to 5 tons of goods and men through the Great Lakes to and
from Montreal, across 36 portages. The <em>hivernants</em>, who wintered in the
interior, had 36
portages just to get to Rainy Lake.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_portage_interpreters.jpg" alt="Interpreters at Grand Portage." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Interpreters reenact the fur-trade era.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But all the portages paled in comparison with the 8½-mile Grand Portage,
a detour around the cataracts and chasms on the lower 22 miles of the
Pigeon River.</p>
<p>Each voyageur had to haul eight 90-pound packs; carrying two at a time,
the men needed seven days and 70 miles of walking to complete it.</p>
<p>This Kitchi Onigaming, or great carrying place, was the critical link
between the Great Lakes and a virtually unbroken water highway to the
west. But it was a miserable gantlet of muck and mosquitoes, rising
nearly 700 feet to the Pigeon River.</p>
<p>When the first European to use the route, Pierre de la Verendrye,
arrived in 1731, his men &quot;mutinied and loudly demanded that I should
turn back.&quot;</p>
<p>Over the years, in such books as Grace Lee Nute's &quot;The Voyageur,&quot;
these workhorses of the fur trade have been portrayed as jolly, carefree
fellows who belted out saucy tunes to relieve the tedium and competed to
see who could paddle fastest or carry the heaviest pack.</p>
<p>But ranger Veit doubts they were quite so lighthearted.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;I think that's a Grace Lee Nute spin on things,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't
think it was all that jolly. It was the best a lot of these young guys
could do.&quot;</p>
<p>They were mostly illiterate second and third sons from hardscrabble
farms along the St. Lawrence Seaway, he said, whose families were paid
in cash when they signed with the fur companies.</p>
<p>Many later fell into deep debt to the company by buying inflated goods
at its Grand Portage store, making themselves, in effect, indentured
servants.</p>
<p>They often died young of back injuries and hernias, but they didn't see
themselves as victims.</p>
<p>&quot;They knew what to expect,&quot; says volunteer interpreter Jim Alling of
Bloomington, Ind. &quot;Their expectation was, 'I'm going to knock my
brains out being a voyageur.' There was a pride in being able to
endure.&quot;</p>
<h3>Moving across the border</h3>
<p>Since the Scottish-owned depot lay on American soil, it was moved lock,
stock and barrel in 1803 to the banks of the Kaministiquia River in
Thunder Bay, Ontario, from which paddlers could reach Rainy Lake on a
longer route. Soon, the site was overgrown.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/v/o/voyageur_interpreter_storage_barn.jpg" alt="Interpreter dressed as Voyageur at Grand Portage Monument" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Volunteer Jim Alling, dressed as a voyageur, shows tourists around the
stockade's supply depot.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But in the 1930s, with the help of federal work programs, the Grand
Portage site was excavated and the stockade reconstructed by crews of
local Ojibwe, many of them descendants of voyageurs.</p>
<p>The band donated the land, and it became a national monument in 1958;
after the first re-creation burned in 1969, a more elaborate one was
built, with a palisade, Great Hall, lookout tower, kitchen, warehouse,
fur press and Ojibwe encampment.</p>
<p>Now, a heritage center first promised in 1958 finally has opened,
enabling the park service to display the artifacts found over the years
and to better tell the story of the Ojibwe, who made the fur trade
possible and whose land surrounds the monument.</p>
<p>There are a thousand stories, and every day, a corps of costumed
interpreters tells some of them.</p>
<p>When I was there on opening weekend, Veit was in the brown wool suit of
a clerk, standing in front of a map of Scottish fur trader Alexander
Mackenzie's successful trek across the continent in pursuit of the
fabled Northwest Passage.</p>
<p>&quot;We're all fans of Mackenzie because he got to the Pacific first,&quot; he
said. &quot;Mackenzie made it in 1793, 10 years before the guys with better
PR and Thomas Jefferson backing them. He made a blueprint for Lewis and
Clark to follow, in terms of saying it could be done.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the Ojibwe encampment, Bemidji State student Jeremy Kingsbury, in the
red sash and muslin blouse of a voyageur, was starting his fourth summer
at Grand Portage, selecting logs for a garden shelter.</p>
<p>&quot;The most important thing I say is that it wasn't only negative, what
happened between the Ojibwe and the Europeans,&quot; he said. &quot;They didn't
drop what they were doing to participate in what the Europeans were
doing, and they didn't go away just because the Europeans showed up.
And they're still not away.&quot;</p>
<p>Kingsbury isn't Ojibwe, though he has studied the language and culture
since he was in high school.</p>
<p>&quot;We've gone through our fair share of native interpreters,&quot; he said.
&quot;After a while, they can't handle it anymore. They get it only two or
three times a year, but it's, 'Hey, it's Pocahontas.'&quot;</p>
<p>In the heirloom garden, volunteer interpreter Sue Alling was working
with a rake made of deer antlers.</p>
<p>&quot;The Ojibwe called this a three sisters garden-squash, bean and
corn,&quot; she said. &quot;The corn grows up, the pole beans grow up around the
cornstalks and the squash leaves cover the ground from the baking sun,&quot;
she said.</p>
<p>In the warehouse, Jim Alling showed us a North West Co. invoice from
April 27, 1797, listing the precise contents of one 36-foot-long
Montreal canoe: 8,100 pounds, including 5,400 pounds of cargo and 2,700
pounds of men, paddles, tools, rum and beef.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_portage_high_falls_horizontal.jpg" alt="High Falls on the Pigeon River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;They were fanatics about record-keeping,&quot; he said. &quot;They used them
for forecasting the future, to know what to order-if the Cree wanted
wool blankets, for example, you had to get them from London.&quot;</p>
<p>It wasn't a cooking day in the kitchen, where the descendants of the
original Ojibwe fishermen bring in herring twice a week for interpreters
to cook, along with bread and such seasonal dishes as rhubarb pie.</p>
<p>Instead, interpreter Karl Koster showed us a bowl of pemmican, a mixture
of suet and buffalo meat that's pounded and dried for easy transport.</p>
<p>It was so important, he said, there were &quot;pemmican wars&quot; between North
West Co. and its chief rival, the Hudson's Bay Co.</p>
<p>&quot;It was the Power Bar of the 18th century,&quot; he said. &quot;You needed
something that could fuel you up if you could not stop and hunt.&quot;</p>
<p>On a typical day at Grand Portage National Monument, says Neil, visitors
can watch historic weapons being fired, hear a bagpiper, try on the
clothing of the fur trade, play voyageur games and see a canoe being
built.</p>
<p>&quot;We always have somebody doing something,&quot; she says. &quot;It's a very
interactive site. You're not going to find a ranger with his face stuck
in a book.&quot;</p>
<p>The biggest event of the year is in August, when the national monument
holds a rendezvous and the Ojibwe band holds a powwow.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_portage_interpreters2.jpg" alt="Fur-trade interpreters at Grand Portage." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Interpreters head across the stockade grounds.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A modern-day equivalent of the 18th-century rendezvous, which could draw
as many as 1,200 people over a month, it's a colorful juncture of
cultures, with re-enactors mingling with Ojibwe, Cree and Assiniboine
dancers and the many people who are enthralled by the fur-trade era.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a pretty amazing story,&quot; Neil says. &quot;In fact, I think Mel
Gibson should do a movie about it. We're a little unit with a very big
story to tell.&quot;</p>
