<h2>Grand Rapids may not be the Emerald City, but its trees are green, and its lakes glitter.</h2>

<p>In northern Minnesota, the logging town of Grand Rapids has produced
many legends: prize lumberjacks, such as Gunnysack Pete and Tamarack
Joe, but also an adorable little girl who became famous for her ruby
slippers.</p>
<p>Loggers came first, and that era is re-created on the edge of town, on
the wooded grounds of Forest History Center. On a summer day there, it
may feel 80 degrees and sunny, but really it's a freezing day in
December 1900.</p>
<p>Miss Minnie the &quot;cookee,&quot; or cook's assistant, is showing us around
the logging camp under the baleful glare of her boss, Miss Rebecca. We
walk by a giant rut cutter, used to make grooves in the ice roads for
the logging sleighs.</p>
<p>We visit Miss Nettie in the clerk's cabin, where loggers buy socks and
long johns: &quot;They don't take them off all winter. If they go in the
hospital with a serious injury, sometimes the nurses have to shave them
off; the hair just grows right through them.&quot;</p>
<p>We visit Miss Rebecca, who hands out freshly baked sourdough biscuits.
Miss Rebecca is a very important person here: &quot;Men choose a camp based
on the kind of cook it's got. If the cook's a belly-robber, they
won't stay very long.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We visit the bunkhouse and Oscar the bull cook, whose job includes
waking up the men: &quot;Daylight in the swamp!&quot; he shouts,
demonstrating.</p>
<p>Then he breaks character a bit: &quot;It's been 100 years since daylight
came through those trees, and it's our job to cut them down. It's
actually not a very good idea, but we think it is.&quot;</p>
<p>The Minnesota Historical Society's reconstructed camp is a remnant of
the days when magnificent pines blanketed northern Minnesota. That is,
until men with such names as Weyerhaeuser and Pillsbury put up 300-man
camps like this one to clear-cut timber and, a year or two later, move
on.</p>
<p>The second part of the story is told at the end of a forest path, on a
channel of the Mississippi. There, it's May 1901, the second month of a
log drive, and a bargelike shack called a wanigan has moored for the
night.</p>
<p>Inside, cooks provide for the 30 &quot;river pigs&quot; who dance with cleated
boots on 130,000 floating logs, positioning them with pike poles or,
failing that, dynamite.</p>
<p>Today, lumber — aspen, mostly — still rolls through this town of
8,000, on trucks headed for the downtown paper mill of UPM Blandin,
Grand Rapids' largest employer.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_rapids_garland_home.jpg" alt="Judy Garland's childhood home." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Judy Garland's childhood home now is a museum.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Grand Rapids is surrounded by lakes, as well as forests, and it's also
part of the Iron Range. But its true lot in life, it seems, is to keep
legends alive.</p>
<p>Along with the lumberjacks, a 4-year-old named Frances Gumm left her
mark on the town before her family moved to California in 1926.</p>
<p>Baby Gumm, who loved the spotlight so much her father had to carry her
off the stage after her debut singing &quot;Jingle Bells,&quot; became Judy
Garland.</p>
<p>Two permanent sites allow fans to immerse themselves in Judy lore any
time.</p>
<p>In the Old Central School downtown, above two floors of shops and a
restaurant, the Judy Garland exhibit at the Itasca Historical Museum
proves that the star, who can hardly be expected to remember a state she
left at age 4, was at least a good sport.</p>
<p>Three times, she posed for photos showing her reading copies of
home-state newspapers, and she was quoted in a 1960 interview saying,
&quot;I do know that is the only time I ever saw my mother and father happy,
you know, in that wonderful town . . . for such a mixed-up life later,
it started out beautifully.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The star's white-frame childhood home has come to rest on donated land
just south of town, having been uprooted three times.</p>
<p>There's a gift shop in back, selling snow globes and miniatures of the
famous ruby slippers that were stolen from the museum in August 2005 and
never have been recovered.</p>
<p>At her birthplace, the emphasis is more on Baby Gumm, the darling
toddler, and Dorothy, the terrific teen-ager, than on Judy, the sad star
who married five times, became addicted to the benzedrine &quot;happy
pills&quot; the studio provided to help her lose weight and at 47 died of
an overdose of sleeping pills.</p>
<p>For years, many in the town looked askance at the troubled star. Fans,
however, remain as avid as ever.</p>
<p>They stream in from around the world for the annual Wizard of Oz
Festival, trading memorabilia and listening raptly to presentations by
historians and those who knew her.</p>

<p>Bicyclists also beat a path to Grand Rapids, the western trailhead of
the Mesabi Trail. Grand Rapids is known as a paper-mill town, but it's
also the westernmost part of the Iron Range.</p>
<p>From the Itasca County Fairgrounds, where locals gather on summer
evenings to watch stock-car races, a 74½-mile stretch of the paved trail
winds past lovely mine-pit lakes, wetlands and all the towns and
attractions of the Iron Range.</p>
<p>Grand Rapids also is the southernmost point on the Edge of the
Wilderness scenic route, the first in Minnesota to be named a National
Scenic Byway.</p>
<p>From the paper mill, it winds 47 miles northward, past pristine forests,
undeveloped lakes and the occasional quiet village.</p>
<p>The Lind-Greenway Mine, which closed in 1976, is marked by the first of
many interpretive displays along this ribbon of asphalt, which locals
called &quot;Highway Loop-de-Loop.&quot;</p>
<p>Others mark a black spruce and tamarack bog and the birch stand at
Pughole Lake, a good place to slip in a canoe.</p>

<p>Suomi Hills was the site of a Civilian Conservation Corps work camp in
1933 and, a decade later, a prisoner of war camp. Named by its earliest
settlers — Suomi is Finnish for &quot;homeland&quot; — it's now a Chippewa
National Forest recreation area, known for its 21 miles of challenging
ski trails.</p>
<p>Farther north, over the Laurentian Divide, a wooden river pig stands
with hook in hand outside Bigfork's city hall. Just to the east is
Scenic State Park, one of Minnesota's most overlooked parks.</p>
<p>Effie is at the end of the route. It's known for its annual rodeo —
and its giant mosquito.</p>
