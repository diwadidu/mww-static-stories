<h2>Laura Ingalls Wilder's home in rural Missouri was the final stop on a famously winding path.</h2>

Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote all her books in this house in Mansfield, Mo.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Mansfield, Mo., has never been a particularly prosperous town. Lying in
the heart of the Ozarks, its landscape is bucolic but barely fertile.</p>
<p>In 1894, however, a stream of people seeking better lives was flowing
through this Gem City of the Ozarks, and among them was 27-year-old
Laura Ingalls Wilder, who had traveled in a horse-drawn hack from De
Smet, S.D., with her husband, Almanzo, and their daughter, Rose.</p>
<p>As a child, Laura had zigzagged across the Midwest with her family,
dogged by failure. Her life with Almanzo seemed similarly destined: Two
years after they married, their barn barned.</p>
<p>The next year, they contracted diphtheria, and Almanzo suffered a stroke
that crippled him for life.</p>
<p>The year after that, their infant son died. Their house burned down and
their crops failed. They moved to Florida, then back to De Smet.</p>
<p>When they had saved $100, they left for the Land of the Big Red Apple.
It was on the new rail line and had a flour mill, two general stores,
two drug stores, two churches, a school and a bank.</p>
<p>They bought a parcel of rocky land on a ridge a mile east of town and
began scraping together a living.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Almanzo sold firewood in town and carted people and freight from the
depot. Laura cooked meals for men working on the railroad. They raised
apples, beans, sheep, goats, cows and hens; Laura became renowned for
having hens that lay eggs in winter, when no others would.</p>
<p>But they never had much until, at age 65, Laura published &quot;Little House
in the Big Woods,&quot; followed by the eight other books in what became
the famous children's series.</p>
<p>They were all written in Mansfield at what Laura called Rocky Ridge
Farm, the final stop on a pilgrimage route that stretches from Pepin,
Wis., to Walnut Grove, Minn., Burr Oak, Iowa, and De Smet, S.D.</p>
<p>Since Laura's death in 1957, fans have streamed into the town of 1,400
to see the house, the town and the cemetery where Laura, Almanzo and
Rose are buried. Mansfield no longer is known for the shining apples
that drew hopeful settlers a century ago.</p>
<p>But the town still fills with tourists, especially for the outdoor
pageant in July and August and Wilder Days in September.</p>
<p>For Laura fans, this is where the treasure is. Laura lived to be 90, and
family heirlooms and memorabilia ended up in the museum adjoining her
house-the family Bible, with birth dates entered in flowing script;
and Laura's and Mary's school slates, for which Pa eked out money in
&quot;On the Banks of Plum Creek.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mansfield_gravestone.jpg" alt="Laura and Almanzo's gravestone." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>There's the calling card of Nellie Owens, whom Laura called Nellie
Oleson in her books, and Laura's teaching certificate.</p>
<p>And then there's the item everyone wants to see-Pa's fiddle, whose
merry tunes Laura carried in a cherished refrain from book to book.</p>
<p>When we were there one spring day, the museum's guest book filled with
names of visitors from half a dozen states within an hour. Grown women
were oohing and aahing over the battered fiddle-&quot;Pa actually
<em>played</em> this for Mary and Laura,&quot; they
told their daughters reverently.</p>
<p>In one corner, two little girls walked from Ma's pearl-handled pen to a
crazy quilt, their long black braids and ankle-length plaid flannel
dresses swishing. It's their everyday attire, said their mother,
Charmaine Schafernak of Libertyville, Ill.</p>
<p>&quot;Ever since they were little, I don't know why, they've been like
this,&quot; she said. &quot;If we could turn the clock back for them, they'd
love that.&quot;</p>
<p>In the house, Hazel Freeman was starting a tour in Laura's
bright-yellow kitchen, with the window through which Laura looked when
she was doing tedious chores and the feel of a child's playhouse.</p>
<p>&quot;Laura was a tiny little lady; that's why the counters are so low,&quot;
she said.</p>
<p>Once, the kitchen was the couple's entire house. Pa added small rooms
one by one between 1896 and 1913, each with low ceilings and sloping
floors.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the dining room, there's the spindled rocking chair in which Laura
answered mail, and a pile of birthday greetings Laura received a few
days before her death.</p>
<p>The parlor includes a fireplace made not from brick but from three huge
slabs of stone from the farm, on which Laura insisted (&quot;For the only
time in my life, I made use of a woman's time-honored weapon,
tears&quot;).</p>
<p>There's Laura's narrow, bright-green bedroom, adorned with prints from
a Currier &amp; Ives calendar, and the adjoining study with the secretary at
which she wrote when she couldn't sleep.</p>
<p>It's all preserved as it was in the 1940s and '50s, along with the
pastoral views from the many windows, which Laura loved to watch and
called her &quot;pictures.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She has windows everywhere,&quot; said her daughter, Rose, &quot;not only in
her house, but in her mind.&quot;</p>
