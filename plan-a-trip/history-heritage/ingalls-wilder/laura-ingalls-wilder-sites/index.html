<p>Laura Ingalls Wilder, who once said, &quot;At the time, I had no idea I was
writing history,&quot; would be very surprised to find that the eight
books she wrote about the Midwestern frontier of the 1870s and 1880s
have become the basis of a well-beaten <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ingalls-wilder/wilder-pageants/">tourist
path</a>.</p>
<p>To a log cabin in Wisconsin they come, and to Laura's farmhouse in
Missouri. They track down a depression above the banks of a Minnesota
creek, and a shanty on the Kansas prairie.</p>
<p>These starry-eyed fans are the Deadheads of the preteen set, traveling
with their equally avid mothers and sometimes grandmothers, who pass on
a love for the &quot;Little House&quot; books like a cherished heirloom.</p>
<p>More than a century and a half after Laura's birth in 1867, her books are as
beloved as ever.</p>
<p>Sadie DeJong of Arizona City, Ariz., brought the books home from the
one-room schoolhouse she attended on the North Dakota prairie; her
Dutch-born mother, read them, too, learning English by deciphering
Laura's tales of sleigh rides and fiddle music by the fire — and of
grasshopper plagues and deadly blizzards.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;My mother loved all those pioneer books; she said they were things she
could relate to,&quot; DeJong said. &quot;I was really interested in them,
too. It was the same for us growing up: We didn't have much, but we
still seemed very happy.&quot;</p>
<p>DeJong passed on a love for the simple life and the &quot;Little House&quot;
books to her daughter, Mary Kirkpatrick, whom I met in Burr Oak, Iowa.</p>
<p>The Ingallses spent a year in that hamlet, just south of the Minnesota
border, where Pa Ingalls managed a hotel after his crops failed in
Walnut Grove, Minn.</p>
<p>It was a sad year that Laura never mentioned in her books: an infant
brother, Freddie, died on the journey there, and the family lived next
to a saloon.</p>
<p>They were so poor a doctor's wife tried to adopt Laura, and they left
in the middle of the night with their debts unpaid.</p>
<p>Now the restored hotel is the Laura Ingalls Wilder Park and Museum,
where tour guides talk about &quot;the missing link&quot; while leading
visitors through rooms filled with period furnishings.</p>
<p>Kirkpatrick and her son, Tyler, were there on a Laura road trip. They already
had visited the &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; site in Kansas, where
Pa built a cabin on land the Indians still owned, and Rocky Ridge Farm
in southwest Missouri, where Laura wrote her books.</p>
<p>After Burr Oak, they headed for Pepin, Wis., Laura's birthplace and
setting for &quot;Little House in the Big Woods,&quot; and Spring Valley,
Minn., where Laura and her husband, Almanzo, spent 1½ years living with Almanzo's parents
before moving, briefly, to Florida.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/e/pepin_laura_cabin.jpg" alt="A re-creation of Laura's Pepin house." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In the bluffs above Pepin, Wis., a cabin re-creates Laura's birthplace.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then, they visited Walnut Grove, setting for &quot;On the Banks of Plum
Creek&quot; and the 1974-83 &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; TV series;
De Smet, S.D., the end of the line for Ma and Pa and the setting for
five books; and Keystone, S.D., where Carrie Ingalls ran a newspaper.</p>
<p>The peregrinations of Laura and her family are complex; they moved seven
times in 10 years, often doubling back on their tracks. But it is the
plainness of pioneer life that led Kirkpatrick to trace the family's
route.</p>
<p>&quot;I like the simplicity of the life, the traditional values and the
family unity,&quot; she said. &quot;Of all the sites, Kansas struck me the
most; it was the least touristy and most intact. Standing out there,
looking across the prairie, you get a sense of what it really was
like.&quot;</p>
<p>Kirkpatrick's son is the fourth generation to become enthralled by the
Ingallses and their adventures.</p>
<p>&quot;Tyler has a real passion for it,&quot; she said. &quot;He identifies so much
with them as a family. When we got to the part in the books where Jack
dies, his eyes filled with tears, and he kept asking, 'Why did Jack
have to die?' It was almost like it was his own dog.&quot;</p>
<p>The homes of Laura and her family are easily visited. They're listed
below in the order in which the family lived there.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.pepinwisconsin.com/">Pepin, Wisconsin</a></h3>
<p>A re-created log house, representing Laura's 1867 birthplace, stands

<p>The Little House Wayside, which is not furnished, can be visited any
time; in Pepin, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Historical Museum is open May
15 through Oct. 15.</p>

It's open from April through October.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.walnutgrove.org/">Walnut Grove, Minnesota</a></h3>
<p>This farm town of 625 has only a church bell, a quilt and the site of a
dugout to show for the 3½ years the Ingallses lived there at two
separate times.</p>

In 1876, Laura's family lived at Master's Hotel in Burr Oak, Iowa.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But the museum is interesting, and visitors can drive to see the site of
the family's creekside dugout.</p>

<h3>Mansfield, Missouri</h3>

<p>There's a trove of family heirlooms and memorabilia in the adjoining
