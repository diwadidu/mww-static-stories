<h2>A scrappy pioneer family is brought to life each year in two towns that played a prominent role in the life of Laura Ingalls Wilder.</h2>

The Laura Ingalls Wilder pageant in Walnut Grove, Minn., attracts fans
from around the world.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's morning in the Little Town on the Prairie, and we're thumbing
through the guest book at the Prairie House Manor B&amp;B.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't believe we are in the 'Little Town' where Laura grew
up,&quot; one woman wrote. &quot;This is truly a dream come true,&quot; wrote
another.</p>
<p>So many little girls, so many dreams. When Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote
her nine books about growing up on the American frontier of the 1870s
and 1880s, she had no idea her idealized portrait of pioneer life would
be such powerful medicine to so many.</p>
<p>Most people are elated to see the real places where Laura lived. A few,
perhaps those who cherished her most, are deflated.</p>
<p>&quot;When you're little, it's all so warm and fuzzy, so sentimental,&quot;
said devoted fan Jennifer Smith of Lake Forest, Calif., over breakfast.
&quot;Now, I think, 'What a miserable life they led.' &quot;</p>
<p>De Smet, S.D., was the end of the line for the Ingallses; Charles
Ingalls had moved his wife and four daughters seven times in 10 years.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He seemed to have a knack for leading his family into disaster: to land
in Kansas that still was owned by the Osage; to Walnut Grove, Minn., a
year into a grasshopper plague; to a failing hotel in Burr Oak, Iowa,
just as the plague ended and crops flourished.</p>
<p>But what do young readers remember from the books? Laura exploring Plum
Creek, Pa playing his fiddle and Christmas stockings filled with
peppermint candy and shiny new pennies.</p>
<p>The first book, &quot;Little House in the Big Woods,&quot; was published in
1932. Today, Pa Ingalls' meandering path from Pepin, Wis., to points
all across the Midwest has become a well-beaten tourist route.</p>
<p>Two of the towns have been elevated to shrinelike status: Walnut Grove,
Minn., made famous by the TV series &quot;Little House on the Prairie,&quot;
and De Smet,S.D., location of five of Laura's books and two family
homes.</p>
<p>Both towns have museums and sites that can be visited year-round. But
true fans come during pageant season.</p>
<h3>A story comes alive</h3>
<p>It's twilight on the banks of Plum Creek, and in the distance we see
cars, waves of them as far as the eye can see, like the prairie grass
Laura loved. Walnut Grove, a farm town of only 625, draws thousands of
visitors to its pageant, held every July since 1978.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/walnut_grove_dugout.jpg" alt="A dugout in Walnut Grove." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A dugout is part of the set for the pageant in Walnut Grove.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I'm sitting next to 7-year-old Jacob Eastman, whose parents have driven
him here from Milwaukee. His eyes are shining.</p>
<p>&quot;His teacher read his class the books a little at a time, and at the
end of the year, they had a party and made Laura's wedding cake,&quot;
says Cindy Eastman. &quot;We came because he got so excited about it.&quot;</p>
<p>A covered wagon pulled by two horses pulls up to a grass-covered dugout
on the edge of the outdoor set, and the play begins. It's technically
impressive-hydraulic lifts move wooden sets, and buried gas lines
start a prairie fire that Jacob calls &quot;way awesome.&quot;</p>
<p>The acting is exuberant: Nellie Oleson is a swaggering brat, Mr. Kennedy
is a stand-up comic and stoic Pa shocks us by flinging down a pole and
whining, &quot;Every day is a nightmare!&quot;</p>
<p>When it's over, Jacob rushes off to get an autograph from Laura. But
nasty Nellie has the biggest circle of admirers. &quot;Do you want to know
who my real sisters are? Mary and Laura!&quot; She guffaws. &quot;Pretty neat,
huh?&quot;</p>
<p>All the next morning, Sunday, we listen for the peals of the bell at
English Lutheran. The bell, for which Pa gave the astounding sum of
$26.15 (remembered by Laura as $3), is all that's left from the
Ingalls' 3½ years in Walnut Grove.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>My 7-year-old daughter stands outside the church, staring up at it.
&quot;That's the same bell that Laura, Pa, Mary and Ma heard,&quot; she
whispers.</p>
<p>Finally, we step inside the church and ring the bell. It sounds exactly
like every other church bell; somehow, we're disappointed.</p>
<p>A baby grasshopper is hopping on the dashboard when we get back in the
car. The grasshopper plague of 1873-77 is the most memorable part of
&quot;On the Banks of Plum Creek,&quot; and the town's Wilder museum has a
fascinating exhibit about the insect, which infested the area as
recently as 1989.</p>
<p>When we visit, the museum is full of visitors. We buy postcards and note
that, according to the attendance board behind the counter, no one from
Hawaii has visited this year.</p>
<p>The clerk looks worried. &quot;I don't know why Hawaii is so late this
year,&quot; she says, and turns over the board. &quot;It was No. 3 last year.
We've had all six Canadian provinces and 33 countries, though.&quot;</p>
<p>Not far north of town is the former Ingalls farm. Their first dwelling
there prompted virtually the only complaint Ma made in seven books:
&quot;Oh, Charles, we've never had to live in a dugout yet.&quot;</p>
<p>It was scraped out of the steep banks of Plum Creek; today, wheat grows
a few yards above the depression that marks the site, and the wild plum
trees below still shade the creek's muddy waters.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/desmet_homestead_pageant.jpg" alt="Wagon rides in De Smet, S.D." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Back at Plum Creek Park, the Family Festival is in full swing. Children
are splashing through the creek, which is clear here, and a bluegrass
quintet is playing on a stage. Harry Brosam is making a broom from his
own broom corn and has drawn a crowd that's hypnotized by his bundling
and winding.</p>
<h3>Traveling west</h3>
<p>We buy a child-size broom and head west for De Smet. In 1879, Ma and the
four girls traveled part of the way on the train; Pa had taken a job
with the railroad and had preceded them. De Smet today is a quiet but
fairly prosperous town of 1,200.</p>
<p>The tour starts at the Surveyor's House, the Ingallses' borrowed first
home. It's small, though 12-year-old Laura thought it was a palace; at
any rate, it was big enough for other homesteaders to sleep on the
floor, 25 cents per night.</p>
<p>Next we head to Ma and Pa's frame home, which Pa built in 1887; despite
his lust for wide open spaces, he never made it as a farmer.</p>
<p>There's a wealth of photos, clothes, furniture and books owned by the
family, including Rose Wilder Lane, Laura's only child and a world
traveler who, according to our guide, once was the highest-paid
journalist in the world.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Upstairs, we meet Jennifer Smith, who has read nearly everything written
about the family, and we start gossiping.</p>
<p>We ponder the odd fact that Ma, Laura and Rose each had infant boys who
died, and that the four daughters produced only one grandchild. We muse
on Pa's inability to bring in a crop, and Ma's unnatural calm-and,
according to Rose, her silence.</p>
<p>That night, we drive to a hillside near the shores of Silver Lake, now a
cattail marsh, to see De Smet's pageant, which it has put on since
1972. There are wagon rides for the kids, and people from all over the
continent have come to sit on these concrete benches on the prairie.</p>
<p>And this spot, with the prairie rolling off into a horizon aglow with
the setting sun, resonates with the past. When the pageant ends with a
floodlight on the cottonwood seedlings Pa planted, now tall and full, a
reverent sigh rises from the audience.</p>
<p>As a young woman in De Smet, Laura suffered her own string of disasters.
She was 27 when she and Almanzo, her husband, moved to a farm in
Missouri and finally carved out a modest prosperity.</p>
<p>At age 63, she began to mine her memories about &quot;the Land of
Used-to-Be,&quot; as she called it. At first, she thought one book would
be enough. &quot;But to my surprise,&quot; she wrote, &quot;I have discovered that
I have led a very interesting life.&quot;</p>
