<h2>In summer, excursion boats give visitors a chance to see historic beacons.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/o/copper_harbor_lighthouse2.jpg" alt="Copper Harbor Lighthouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Copper Harbor lighthouse is on a peninsula, but accessible only by
water.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>By definition, lighthouses aren't easy to visit.</p>
<p>Most are between a rock and a hard place, out of the way and on the edge
of a fickle inland sea.</p>
<p>&quot;When the government came here after 1843, they were afraid the Native
Americans would be hostile, but they quickly found out the only thing
hostile was Lake Superior,&quot; said our captain on a cruise to the
Copper Harbor Lighthouse in Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula.</p>
<p>Like the 1866 Copper Harbor light, many lighthouses in the western Great
Lakes are accessible only by boat.</p>
<p>Off the eastern edge of the Upper Peninsula, the 1931 DeTour Reef Light
sits on a concrete platform surrounded by water, and visitors have to
wear a safety harness to climb up and off it.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Around the Apostles, Door County and Mackinac Straits, most lights are
on islands or shoals.</p>
<p>The Copper Harbor light is on the tip of a peninsula that protects the
harbor, but private owners make it inacessible by land. So we motored
out on one of the excursion company's Sunset Tours.</p>
<p>Geologist Douglass Houghton found the first copper here in 1840, and a
copper rush started after the Treaty of La Pointe was signed in 1842.
Shipping boomed, but some boats didn't survive.</p>
<p>Our captain pointed out the grave of the John Jacob Astor, the first
commercial boat on Lake Superior and the first wreck when it broke apart
in a 1844 gale. Nearby, the City of Superior was brand-new when it sank
in an 1857 squall.</p>
<p>The first lighthouse was finished in 1848 but soon began to crumble and
was replaced. The 1848 keeper's quarters remain and is a museum,
furnished as it would have been.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images///m//mackinac_island_light_stations.jpg" alt="The harbor entrance to Mackinac Island." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Round Island lights across from Mackinac Island are the first
beacons passengers see on Shepler's eastbound cruise.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>After we docked, we walked through the house, which sheltered eight
keepers and their families between 1849 and 1919. Cans of supplies were
on kitchen shelves, card games and a sewing machine in the bedroom and
wool pants and a carpetbag in the closet.</p>
<p>On the grounds, we walked wooded paths past historical plaques. &quot;I fear
(copper fever)
may prove the ruin of hundreds of adventurers who will
come with expectations never to be realized,&quot; Houghton said in 1841.
He drowned four years later at age 37, caught in an open boat by a
nor'easter.</p>
<p>On the boat ride back, the captain told us how protruding rock in the
harbor makes clearance as little as 14½ feet in one spot, and how the
color of harbor lights and the timing of their flashes tell mariners
where they are.</p>
<p>&quot;When it's green and flashing every six seconds, I know I'm at Copper
Harbor in Michigan,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>By then, the sun was sinking over the blue lake, turning the horizon a
warm orange. The scene looked just the Michigan state license plate.</p>
<p>There's no longer a cruise to Copper Harbor Lighthouse, so it's closed
because there's no other access.</p>
<p>Here's how you can see the light in other places.</p>
<p><strong>Memorial Day weekend to the first weekend of October, <a href="http://www.ridethefireboat.com/">Fireboat
Cruises</a> of Sturgeon Bay, Wis</strong> . At
