<h2>Around Lake Superior, overnight guests can try out life at a lighthouse.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_harbors_lighthouse.jpg" alt="Lighthouse B&B in Two Harbors" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Two Harbors, Minn., the Lighthouse B&B is run by the county
historical society.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When Lake Superior lighthouses had keepers, there was nothing romantic
about life there.</p>
<p>The posts were cold, lonely and meagerly furnished on the government
dime. The work was physically taxing and repetitive. Through the long
nights, keepers had to get up every two hours to wind the mechanism that
rotated the lens.</p>
<p>It's no wonder many of the early lighthouse keepers were hermits or
grouches.</p>
<p>Lighthouses are happier places these days. That's because the work is
automated, and at some, people can be guests, enjoying all the glamor
without any of the grunt work.</p>
<p>Around Lake Superior, some lighthouses welcome guests year-round.
Upholstered comfort has replaced civil-service austerity, and when a
guest is curled up in an easy chair drinking a glass of brandy, those
howling winds do seem kind of romantic.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The pea-soup fogs that made long-ago keepers worry about shipwrecks send
us on reveries about the old days, when Lake Superior often exacted a
harsh toll on those who lived with it.</p>
<p>I was reading scrapbooks in the cozy living room of Big Bay Point
Lighthouse B&amp;B in Michigan when I came upon the story of William Prior,
one of Lake Superior's most notable grouches.</p>
<p>In the three years after the lighthouse was finished in 1896, Prior went
through four assistants, claiming each one was lazy.</p>
<p>Finally, the lighthouse service appointed his son George to the post,
but in 1901, George fell down steps and died. His bereft father
disappeared into the woods with a rifle and strychnine, and hunters
found him 17 months later, a skeleton hanging from a tree.</p>
<h3>Encounter with a ghost</h3>
<p>Apparently, Prior stayed unhappy even in death. For years, Linda Gamble
ran the lighthouse as an inn with her husband, Jeff, and she'd heard
reports of a ghost when they bought it. Soon, she encountered it
herself.</p>

West of Marquette, Big Bay Lighthouse was built in 1896.

<p>&quot;One night, I heard doors opening in the kitchen, and I thought it was
a drunk coming back from the Lumberjack,&quot; Gamble said. &quot;I have a
temper, and I stormed up, but no one was there.</p>
<p>&quot;So I figured it must be Will, and I said, &quot; 'OK, I know ghosts
don't like change, but we're changing things. I have to get up in the
morning and make breakfast, so cut it out.' Then I slammed a cupboard
and went back to bed.</p>
<p>&quot;The next morning, all the cupboard doors were closed, and we've never
had a reputable report of Will since,&quot; she said. &quot;I call that an
Italian exorcism.&quot;</p>
<p>The history of the Big Bay Point Lighthouse, on a dead-end highway 25
miles west of Marquette, is even more checkered than most.</p>
<p>In 1952, when the building and land were leased to the U.S. Army
National Guard for anti-aircraft artillery training camps, one of the
soldiers committed the murder on which the book and movie &quot;Anatomy of a
Murder&quot; were based.</p>
<p>The crime scene was the nearby Lumberjack Tavern, to which the Gambles
often send guests for late dinners.</p>
<p>No ghosts, storms or violent passions were swirling around the clifftop
lighthouse when my husband and I stayed there in late July, but a hatch
of biting lake flies was.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The invisible but vicious flies forced us to tour the pretty grounds on
the run, taking quick looks at the wooded shoreline, the Serenity
Massage Hut and the quaint outhouse before taking refuge in a screened
gazebo.</p>
<p>The flies thrive on humidity, Jeff Gamble said, and when they sense
drier weather coming, they get desperate for a blood meal.</p>
<p>&quot;This isn't bad,&quot; he said. &quot;Bad is when that white car out there
turns black.&quot;</p>
<p>Luckily, we discovered the flies couldn't find us on the tower catwalk.
Climbing the green spiral stairs, we emerged to a 360-degree view of
lake and forest.</p>
<p>Dusk was approaching, and we saw a bat drop into one of the lighthouse
chimneys. With Wendi and Louie Gonyer of Princeton, Ind., we watched the
sun drop over the Huron Mountains and into the lake with a splash of
color.</p>

<p>&quot;I really like lighthouses, and when Louie said, 'You can stay in
one,' I said, 'Well, yes! I want to do that,' &quot; Wendi Gonyer said.</p>
<p>My husband and I also have stayed at the Lighthouse B&amp;B in Two Harbors,
Minn., and on our Circle Tour, we toured two other lighthouse inns.</p>
<p>Across Keweenaw Bay, near the ship entry to the Portage River, Mike and
Cherie Ditty ran the Jacobsville Lighthouse as an inn for many years,
then put it up for sale.</p>
<p>Built in 1856 to protect ships taking copper ore to Houghton and
Hancock, the lighthouse was rebuilt in 1869 with a red-sandstone tower
that today is covered with white stucco.</p>
<p>The light was extinguished in 1919 when a new light station was built
nearby, and the house and tower have been private since 1958.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Lighthouse B&amp;Bs on Lake Superior</h3>
<p><em>When to go:</em>  Many people want to stay at lighthouses on summer
weekends. But it's also fun to watch November and December storms from
a cozy lighthouse room, and shipping continues on Lake Superior until
the Soo Locks close in January.</p>
