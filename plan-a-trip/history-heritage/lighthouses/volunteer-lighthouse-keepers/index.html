<h2>Around the Great Lakes, volunteers keep the light on for tourists.</h2>

Larry Gorsh spent two weeks as one of the keepers of Big Sable Point

<p>Around the Great Lakes, love for lighthouses is unlimited. Often called
&quot;America's castles,&quot; lighthouses are symbols of a more adventurous
era, and tourists find them irresistible.</p>
<p>Now, the state parks and friends associations who care for them have
found a way to harness all this passion: They're turning tourists into
volunteer keepers.</p>
<p>For a week or two, volunteers live at the lighthouse, hosting visitors
and doing chores. Some get to sleep under quilts in the historic
keepers' quarters.</p>
<p>Some stay at nearby cabins, and others, like Molly and Rich Hoeg of
Duluth, choose to camp at the remote 1904 Crisp Point Light near
Michigan's Shipwreck Coast.</p>
<p>&quot;We liked having it to ourselves,&quot; said Molly Hoeg. &quot;There wasn't
anyone allowed to stay over but us.&quot;</p>
<p>Volunteer slots are available at many lighthouses around Lake Superior
and Michigan.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At Crisp Point on the Upper Peninsula, the Hoegs hosted only 12 to 20
visitors a day, so Rich had plenty of time to shoot photos for his
<a href="http://www.365daysofbirds.com/">blog</a> and Molly for her
<a href="http://superiorfootprints.org/2014/06/18/tending-the-light/">blog</a>.</p>
<p>Some visitors were looking for agates, some came to photograph the
lighthouse and many were avid fans who wanted their <a href="https://uslhs.org/passports">lighthouse
passports</a> stamped.</p>
<p>&quot;You got people who have been to hundreds of lighthouses and are on
their fourth passports,&quot; Molly Hoeg said.</p>
<p>The couple's first stint was in June, a good time for agate-hunting but
not for escaping black flies. The next year, they went back in
September.</p>
<p>At Crisp Point, volunteers have to navigate 18 miles of bumpy road, and
there's no drinking water or electricity at the site.</p>
<p>But in Lower Michigan, at 1869 Tawas Point Light on Lake Huron,
volunteers live in newly restored keeper's quarters amid period
furnishings, some of them original.</p>
<p>This lighthouse, on a sandy spit often called &quot;the Cape Cod of the
Midwest,&quot; is much busier.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/ludington_big_sable.jpg" alt="Big Sable Point Lighthouse near Ludington." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Volunteers staff the 1867 Big Sable Point Lighthouse in Ludington State
Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Volunteers work five days a week, interpreting the history for visitors,
helping in the gift shop and performing light maintenance.</p>
<p>For this, they pay $75 apiece for their two-week working vacation.</p>
<p>Tawas Point State Park modeled its volunteer-keeper program on the one
in Leelanau State Park on Michigan's west coast, home of Grand Traverse
Light.</p>
<p>That program was modeled on the one developed by the Sable Points
Lighthouse Keepers Association, a friends society that cares for Big
Sable and Little Sable Point and the Ludington North Breakwater Light in
Ludington, Mich.</p>
<p>Volunteers at those lights don't pay, though.</p>
<p>&quot;If people are paying $220, they might think they're on vacation, and
they are, but it's a working vacation,&quot; says association director
Craig Renny.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When we visited the 1867 Big Sable Point lighthouse in Ludington State
Park, on the sandy shores of Lake Michigan, we met Larry Gorsh and Sandy
Silver of Sibley, Mo., who were sharing lighthouse-keeping duties for
two weeks with three other couples from three other states.</p>
<p>Larry was stationed at the top of the 112-foot tower, which visitors can
climb. We chatted about the oddity of a lighthouse on a lake — &quot;I've
caught myself saying to visitors, 'Look out at the ocean,' &quot; he
admitted — and the long hours.</p>
<p>The first week, the couple got half a day off and visited nearby
Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. The second week, they got a
whole day off and went to Mackinac Island. Gorsh said he loves the job.</p>
<p>&quot;Where Sandy and I work, we say, 'We're going to work at a lighthouse
for two weeks,' and people say, 'You're going to <em>work</em> on vacation?'
And I say, 'You don't
understand.'</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/r/crisp_point_rainbow.jpg" alt="Post-storm at Crisp Point Light." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Rich Hoeg</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Volunteer keeper Rich Hoeg shot this photo while working at Crisp Point.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;Last week, we had people from Germany, Switzerland and Norway; it's
incredible,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>I asked what lighthouse he wanted to volunteer at next.</p>
<p>&quot;We've decided we want to come back here, with the same four
couples,&quot; he said. &quot;The camaraderie grows pretty quickly out
here.&quot;</p>
<p>Volunteer keepers also staff the DeTour Reef Light, in open water east
of the Mackinac Bridge, and the Pottawatomie Light in Rock Island State
Park, off the tip of Wisconsin's Door Peninsula.</p>
<p>In the Apostle Islands off Wisconsin's Bayfield Peninsula, the National
Park Service appoints volunteers to staff the lighthouses at Sand,
Devils and Michigan islands during the summer tourist season.</p>
<p>The parks look for people who can spend a week or more working, and the
application process is rigorous, generally requiring a letter of intent,
a resume, two letters of recommendation, a phone interview and
orientation.</p>
<p>Some people love lighthouses so much they want to live there
permanently. In 2007, a couple was chosen from 159 applicants to
permanently staff the <a href="https://windpointlighthouse.org/">Wind Point
Lighthouse</a> in Racine, Wis., and host
the popular summer tower climbs.</p>
<p>Below are some of the volunteer-keeper opportunities on the western
Great Lakes. There are also many <a href="http://www.nps.gov/getinvolved/volunteer.htm">positions in national
parks</a>.</p>

in January, ideally for three- or four-week stretches, but positions may
be available through spring. There's a lot of work, so couples are
preferred.</p>
<p>Keepers on Sand Island stay in a modern cabin but must walk two miles to
the lighthouse and have the most campground work. On Devils Island, they
have running water but a lot of grass to cut.</p>
<p>Michigan, which has two lighthouses, has the most steps to climb, but
the campground isn't busy and, says ranger Susan Mackreth, &quot;it has
some of the coolest stories to tell.&quot;</p>

interested should call 715-779-3397, Ext. 303, to discuss opportunities.</p>
<p>&quot;People hear 'lighthouses' and they have this whole romantic notion,
