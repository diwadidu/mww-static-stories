<p>Today, Door County is not a very rugged place. It's a favorite vacation
spot for city folk, and it reflects their tastes with dozens of art
galleries, bistros and B&amp;Bs.</p>
<p>But once, Wisconsin's Door Peninsula was rough and remote, settled
first by Scandinavian fishermen and loggers.</p>
<p>Navigating this long finger of land, which separates the wind-whipped
expanses of Lake Michigan from Green Bay, was no treat for early
mariners.</p>
<p>Its 250 miles of shoreline are littered with shipwrecks, especially
around the treacherous strait between the tip of the peninsula and
Washington Island, which French explorers named <em>Porte des Morts</em>,
or Death's Door.</p>
<p>Lake Michigan doesn't have Lake Superior's rocky cliffs. But its many
sandy reefs and shoals can snag a boat just as easily.</p>
<p>That's why lighthouses line the peninsula. Three of them can be toured
all summer, and four others are easily seen. But the others can be
reached only during Door County Maritime Museum's annual <a href="http://www.dcmm.org/door-county-lighthouse-festivals/">Spring
Lighthouse
Festival</a> on the
second weekend of June and the <a href="http://www.dcmm.org/door-county-lighthouse-festivals/">Fall Lighthouse
Festival</a> on the
first weekend of October.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Tickets go on sale the first week of April and sell quickly. The most
coveted ticket is the cruise to Plum Island, in the middle of the
Death's Door Passage, which allows passengers to get off the boat to
explore the 1895 range lights and the ruins of an 1848 lighthouse.</p>
<p>The Island Clipper Tour, which takes passengers to Rock Island for a
hike to the 1837 Pottawatomie Light, Wisconsin's oldest, and past Plum
Island and the 1873 Pilot Island lighthouse, also is very popular.</p>
<p>A third tour leaves from Fish Creek for Chambers Island, home of an 1868
lighthouse.</p>
<p>Other boat tours cross the Death's Door and explore lights in Baileys
Harbor and Sturgeon Bay. On the Keepers' Kin Tour of Sturgeon Bay,
relatives of lighthouse keepers share stories and memorabilia.</p>
<p>Throughout the tourist season, trips to Washington Island from Gills
Rock on the <a href="http://www.islandclipper.com">Island Clipper</a> include views
of Plum and Pilot islands. The launch makes several trips a day from
late May to early October.</p>

County</a>.</p>

In Sturgeon Bay, Big Red was built to house a fog horn.

<h3>The lights of Sturgeon Bay</h3>
<p>On the Lake Michigan end of the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal, the North
Pierhead Light, nicknamed <em>Big Red</em> , is small but striking, especially
in early evening, when it glows fire-engine red.</p>
<p>Visitors can walk toward it on the concrete pierhead, to which the 1882
fog-signal light is connected only by an elevated catwalk.</p>
<p>The towering 1899 <a href="http://www.dcmm.org/cana-island-lighthouse/door-county-lighthouses/ship-canal/"><strong>Ship Canal
Light</strong></a>
and keeper's house sit on land just behind it, on an active Coast Guard
station that's off-limits to visitors. The vertical tower shook in the
wind, so skeletal supports were added in 1903.</p>
<p>People can drive to the lights or see them from the deck of boats that
cruise the bay and canal daily in warm weather.</p>
<p>On the Green Bay side, at the mouth of Sturgeon Bay, cruise passengers
also will see the 1883 <a href="http://www.dcmm.org/cana-island-lighthouse/door-county-lighthouses/sherwood-point/"><strong>Sherwood Point
Light</strong></a>. In 1983, it became the last U.S. lighthouse on the Great Lakes to be
automated.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Not all of the shipwrecks here were in the early days of navigation.
Leathem Smith, the Sturgeon Bay shipyard owner who invented the
self-unloader, drowned off the point in 1946 after the hull of his yacht
swamped in a squall.</p>
<p>Why? It turned out that a bulkhead had been removed so the previous
owner's father, President Franklin Roosevelt, could move around better
in his wheelchair.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard uses Sherwood Point lighthouse as a retreat house, but
the grounds are open to the public during the Lighthouse Festival.</p>
<p>Sturgeon Bay is the home of the <a href="http://www.dcmm.org/">Door County Maritime
Museum</a>, which holds many interesting exhibits
about shipping and lighthouses.</p>

<h3>Cana Island and range lights, Baileys Harbor</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baileys_harbor_cana.jpg" alt="Cana Island Lighthouse near Baileys Harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Visitors to the 1870 Cana Island Lighthouse pick their way over a rock
causeway.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Near the Door County village of Baileys Harbor, the shining white <a href="http://www.dcmm.org/cana-island-lighthouse/">Cana
Island Light</a> is one of
Lake Michigan's prettiest.</p>
<p>Visitors pick their way over a rock causeway, sometimes through water,
to get to the 1870 lighthouse, which is operated by the Door County
Maritime Museum.</p>
<p>The lighthouse is open daily from May through October. The tour costs
$4, $2 for children 5-17; it's an extra $4 to climb the tower, which
recently was renovated. There's a museum and gift shop inside the
cream-brick keeper's quarters.</p>
<p>Nearby, two 1869 <strong>range lights</strong> were built the same year, one with a
red light and one with a white light, which sailors lined up to get &quot;on
range&quot; while entering the harbor.</p>
<p>Today, they're part of <a href="http://www.ridgessanctuary.org/">Ridges
Sanctuary</a>, a nature preserve. Don't
miss the unusual ridges and swales in the preserve, which harbors many
rare wildflowers, including 25 species of orchid. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/door-county-wildflowers/">Spring
in Door County</a>.</p>
<p>Nearby, there's an old &quot;bird cage&quot; lighthouse, built in 1852 and
closed after the range lights were built. You can see it by boat;
<a href="http://www.lakeshore-adventures.com">Lakeshore Adventures</a> in Baileys
Harbor rents them.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/door_county_eagle_bluff_lighthouse.jpg" alt="Eagle Bluff lighthouse in Door County." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Eagle Bluff is in popular Peninsula State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Eagle Bluff Lighthouse near Fish Creek</h3>
<p>Deep in Peninsula State Park, one of Wisconsin's most popular parks,
<a href="http://www.eagleblufflighthouse.org/">Eagle Bluff Light</a> can be reached
by car, by foot or by bike; it's along the five-mile Sunset Trail,
which brings in bicyclists from adjoining Fish Creek.</p>
<p>The cream-brick lighthouse was built on the bluff in 1868, and the light
still is guiding ships past the shoals on Green Bay.</p>
<p>In 1960, the Door County Historical Society began restoring and
furnishing the lighthouse for use as a museum, with the help of Walter
Duclon, who was a year old when he, his parents and six brothers moved
into the lighthouse in 1883.</p>
<p>His parents were the keepers for the next 35 years. The family amused
itself with music, forming a band and performing at gatherings around
the peninsula. Their rosewood piano remains at the keeper's house.</p>
<p>Tours are on weekends from late May to early June, then daily through
mid-October.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/peninsula/">Peninsula State Park</a> is
Wisconsin's most in-demand camping park and has some of the area's
best bicycling and hiking. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/door-county-outdoors/">Outdoors in Door
County</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/rock_island_pottawatomie_light.jpg" alt="Pottawatomie Light on Rock Island." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Volunteer keepers staff Pottawatomie Light, Wisconsin's oldest
lighthouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Pottawatomie Light, Rock Island</h3>
<p><a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/rockisland/lighthouse"><strong>Pottawatomie
Light</strong></a>
is
the oldest lighthouse in Door County, built in 1858 after an 1836
station washed away, apparently due to faulty mortar. It's also the
most remote, requiring two ferry rides from the mainland, to Washington
Island and then Rock Island, now a state park.</p>
<p>Once on Rock Island, visitors hike a mile to the lighthouse, restored
and furnished as it was in 1910. Volunteer docents recruited by the
Friends of Rock Island give tours, pointing out the stone privy that is
the oldest building in Door County.</p>
<p>They tell stories about the keepers, such as David Corbin, whom a
government inspector found to be so lonely and sullen he was told to
take a three-week leave so he could find a wife. He didn't and is
buried alone not far from the light.</p>
<p>Another keeper did have a wife, who also was a midwife and kept newly
born infants warm in her range's warming oven.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/rock_island_pottawatomie_lens.jpg" alt="The view from Pottawatomie Light." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Friends of Rock Island</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From Pottawatomie Light on Rock Island, visitors can look across Lake
Michigan toward Escanaba.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Tours include the tower room, where the view includes the Grand Traverse
Archipelago to the north. Boats preferred the passage between Rock
Island and neighboring St. Martin Island to the Death's Door between
Rock Island and Washington Island, so the keeper would have had many
entries to make in his log.</p>
<p>The lighthouse is open daily from Memorial Day through Columbus Day. 
Pottawatomie Light allows volunteers to live in the house while giving
tours; for details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/volunteer-lighthouse-keepers/">Living in a
lighthouse</a>.</p>
<p>Rock Island is a great place to camp and includes a historic boathouse.
For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/rock-island-state-park-wisconsin/">Wisconsin's Icelandic
outpost</a>.</p>
<h3>Other Wisconsin lighthouses</h3>
<p>In Wisconsin, there are lighthouses all the way from the 1880 <a href="https://windpointlighthouse.org/">Wind
Point Light</a> in Racine, near the
Illinois border, to the 1913 breakwater light at the Superior entry to
Duluth-Superior Harbor.</p>
<p>On Lake Superior, all of the Wisconsin lighthouses except the one in
Superior are in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, whose 21 islands
have the greatest concentration of National Park Service lighthouses in
the nation.</p>

Apostles</a>.</p>
