<h2>Tales of an 1894 inferno that wiped out Minnesota towns still shock those who hear them.</h2>

<p>On a September day in 1894, Hinckley, Minn., was hell on earth.</p>
<p>As a logging and rail center midway between St. Paul and Duluth, the
town had grown quickly. But during the summer of 1894, less than 2
inches of rain fell.</p>
<p>Small fires smoldered in the countryside, many started when hot cinders
from trains landed in tinder-dry slashings-the crowns, stumps and
branches left behind by logging crews.</p>
<p>On Sept. 1, breezes fanned small fires near Mission Creek and Pokegama,
villages south of Hinckley. They joined, and the flames, breaking
through a thick layer of warm air, were turned into a fiery cyclone by
cool air traveling down from above.</p>
<p>It quickly moved north toward Hinckley, where it became a 4½-mile-high
wall of fire. The air in its path became so hot that buildings seemed to
melt, not burn.</p>
<p>Fireballs appeared out of nowhere, flying through the air.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>By 6 p.m. that day, six towns, including Hinckley and Sandstone, had
been destroyed. At least 418 people were dead.</p>
<p>&quot;TWO MINNESOTA TOWNS UTTERLY DESTROYED BY FIRE,&quot; read the front page
of the next day's New York Times. &quot;GREAT FOREST FIRES IN AMERICA&quot;
read the first of five days' worth of front-page coverage in the London
Times.</p>
<p>Today, the tales of heroism and tragedy told at the Hinckley Fire Museum
are just as gripping as they were a century ago.</p>
<p>&quot;My grandfather used to tell me about the Hinckley Fire when I was a
young girl growing up in Minneapolis,&quot; says Jeanne Coffey, the
director of the museum for many years. &quot;It was an intriguing thing to
him.&quot;</p>
<p>Among the heroes were St. Paul &amp; Duluth engineer Jim Root; his fireman,
John McGowan; and porter John Blair, who arrived on a train from the
north just as the fire reached Hinckley from the south.</p>
<p>With an extra load of panicked townspeople, they backed the flaming
train to Skunk Lake, where nearly 300 people huddled in 18 inches of mud
and slime as the fire passed over them.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/i/hinckley_fire_museum.jpg" alt="Hinckley Fire Museum." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The museum is housed in the St. Paul & Duluth train depot, rebuilt
within two months of the fire.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Today, bicyclists pass Skunk Lake on the old rail bed, now part of the
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/willard_munger/index.html">Willard Munger State
Trail</a>.</p>
<p>The fire sites begin just east of Hinckley along Fire Monument Road. On
the north side of the road is Memorial Cemetery, where a 51-foot granite
monument rises above four long trenches that contain the remains of 248
victims.</p>
<p>Back toward town, the road ends in the juncture of two rail lines. Along
one is Memorial Park, site of a gravel pit in which 100 people huddled
in water and were saved.</p>
<p>Three blocks north along the other line is the St. Paul and Duluth
Depot, rebuilt soon after the original burned. Now it's the museum,
where the story is graphically told.</p>
<p>A 19-minute movie in the old freight room, smelling of aged planks,
explains how careless logging practices and extraordinarily hot, dry
weather led to the destruction of &quot;The Town Built From Wood,&quot; which
had 1,200 to 1,500 residents before the fire. The narrative is broken by
accounts from survivors.</p>
<p>In the old telegrapher's room, a plaster likeness of 25-year-old Thomas
Dunn sits awaiting Root's train from Duluth, on which members of
Dunn's family were traveling. A tape records his last message: &quot;I
think I've stayed too long.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/i/hinckley_grindstone_river.jpg" alt="Grindstone River in Hinckley." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Just outside Hinckley, the Munger State Trail crosses the Grindstone
River, where many people took refuge.

<p>Pathos is unavoidable. Among the grisliest of the museum's exhibits is
the coroner's death list, which lists the dead by number.</p>
<p>Nos. 314-415 are &quot;unknown,&quot; including No. 326: &quot;Male, found in
lumber yard. Only jack knife, watch and buttons left. Not enough found
to be buried.&quot;</p>
<p>Heroism and venality, miracles and wretched bad luck. It's all part of
the Hinckley story.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: <a href="http://hinckleyfiremuseum.com/">Hinckley Fire Museum</a></h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : It's 1¼ hours north of the Twin Cities. The museum is

September and October and daily in July and August.</p>
<p><em>Admission</em> : Admission is $5 adults, $2 teens, $1 children 6-12.</p>

years later. The Fires of 1918 Museum in Moose Lake tells about the
worst single-day natural disaster in Minnesota history.</p>
<p>A 32-mile stretch of the Munger State Trail makes visiting both museums
an interesting bicycle trip. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/munger-bicycle-trail-minnesota/">The Fire
