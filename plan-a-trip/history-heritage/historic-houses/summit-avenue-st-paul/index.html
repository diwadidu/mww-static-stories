<h2>On St. Paul's Summit Avenue, imposing mansions are remnants of the Gilded Age.</h2>

<p>Even tourists from the great European capitals are impressed by Summit
Avenue.</p>
<p>It's not just one mansion, but one after another, all the way from the
Mississippi River to the massive Cathedral of St. Paul, overlooking
downtown and the state Capitol.</p>
<p>This five-mile stretch is one of the most splendid, best-preserved
Victorian streets in the United States. The oldest are at the east end,
on the lip of the bluff overlooking downtown and the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>The richest man in Minnesota built his home there, a 36,000-square-foot
Richardsonian Romanesque mansion of red sandstone, with 13 bathrooms and
22 fireplaces.</p>
<p>Today, the James J. Hill House is owned by the Minnesota Historical
Society, which gives tours of the 1891 house and walking tours past
other mansions built with the spoils of the Gilded Age.</p>

<p>&quot;It was a time when people wanted to spend a lot of money if they had
it,&quot; said guide Joanne Dolney.</p>
<p>Of course, Frank Lloyd Wright called Summit Avenue &quot;the worst
collection of architecture in the world.&quot; One of F. Scott Fitzgerald's
characters called it &quot;a museum of American architectural failures.&quot;</p>
<p>But most people can't help being awed. It's not just the houses, but
the stories behind them.</p>
<p>The walking tours start at the house of James J. Hill, a native of
Canada who started as a teen-age clerk at the steamboat landing in St.
Paul.</p>
<p>He seized opportunities, turning a side business selling wood and coal
into a transportation empire: &quot;He always had the right idea of what the
area needed,&quot; Dolney said.</p>
<p>Eventually, Hill pushed his Great Northern Railway from St. Paul to
Seattle via Glacier National Park, which he and his son, Louis, helped
develop and promote with the slogan &quot;See America First.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_paul_summit_sandstone.jpg" alt="Mansions along Summit Avenue." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

mansion called the "Lion House."
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>He was called the Empire Builder, and his old route, now Amtrak's
passenger line across the Great Plains through Glacier, is named for
him.</p>
<p>For his fifth house in St. Paul, he picked the best spot on the bluffs,
tearing down two houses to get the lot. The rugged red-sandstone house
took 300 people three years to build.</p>
<p>Hill's son Louis lived in the more feminine Georgian Revival house next
door, which incorporates the neoclassical Beaux-Arts style popular in
European capitals, which borrowed it from ancient Rome.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't trust our own styles here; we always borrowed styles from
Europe,&quot; Dolney said.</p>
<p>The next few blocks are lined with an astonishing cavalcade of houses,
with turrets, towers, columns and such embellishments as carved-stone
medallions, nymphs and cherubs.</p>
<p>Summit Avenue hit a rough patch in the 1930s, when some people couldn't
afford the taxes, said Dolney, and again in the 1960s, when many of the
sprawling, energy-guzzling mansions were chopped up into apartments,
some of them little better than flophouses.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the 1970s, the city sold one mansion for $1, on the condition that
the new owners fix it up.</p>
<p>But interest in the Victorian style picked up in the late 1970s and
1980s, along with an interest in preservation. Some of the mansions now
are tony condos.</p>
<p>Others became elegant event centers, such as the 1901 Summit Manor
house, once home to the owner of Schuneman's department store, which
evolved into Dayton's and then Macy's.</p>
<p>Most still are private houses, such as the 1882 Queen Anne next to Louis
Hill's house, and when our tour walked by, the 11-bedroom, 13-bath
house was on the market for $1.995 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Queen Anne is a wonderful style,&quot; Dolney said. &quot;The houses were
built with detail, detail, detail; the more detail, the better.&quot;</p>
<p>Other mansions were built by newspaper publishers, lumber barons,
bankers and manufacturers, many of whom tweaked facades over the years.</p>
<p>Lucius Ordway, the plumbing-company owner whose investment in a
struggling Two Harbors sandpaper company helped create the blue-chip
behemoth 3M, was among many owners who shed Queen Anne turrets in favor
of an Italianate or Tudor look.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_paul_summit_croquet.jpg" alt="Croquet players on Summit Avenue." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Members of the University Club often cross the street to play croquet in
Eagle Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;It's amazing how much a house can change,&quot; Dolney said. &quot;People
were always trying to make them more fashionable.&quot;</p>
<p>Then our tour stopped in front of a house that was a little too
fashionable. Built in the 1970s, it's a series of low boxes with a
front parking lot now shielded by sycamores behind a wrought-iron fence.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not a very popular house on the avenue,&quot; Dolney said.
&quot;There were a lot of people protesting when this was built. This is
what pushed people into starting a preservation group.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, people revere the past. Just beyond the 1928 house owned by James
J. Hill's daughter Rachel-who married the University of Minnesota
football player whose touchdown against the University of Michigan in
1903 helped create the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Brown_Jug_%28American_football%29">Little Brown
Jug</a>
rivalry-we came to the University Club on the brow of Ramsey Hill.</p>
<p>Some of its members had walked across the street to Eagle Park to play
croquet. With the women wearing straw hats and filmy white blouses and
skirts, and the men in vests and white pants, they looked like a
throwback to 1912, when the club was built.</p>
<p>The exclusive club was a haunt of F. Scott Fitzgerald, who attended
dances there.</p>
<p>The middle-class Fitzgerald grew up around Summit Avenue and hobnobbed
with the rich, but his love-hate relationship with them is
well-documented and reflected in his short stories and novels, most
famously &quot;The Great Gatsby.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_paul_fitzgerald_rowhouse.jpg" alt="F. Scott Fitzgerald home in St. Paul." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
F. Scott Fitzgerald finished "This Side of Paradise" in one of these
Summit Avenue rowhouses.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;He was always on the outside looking in at the big rich houses,&quot;
Dolney said.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1919, Fitzgerald lived in a townhouse at 599
Summit, where he completed &quot;This Side of Paradise,&quot; his first
published novel. There's a plaque in front of it.</p>
<p>Another famous Minnesota writer, Sinclair Lewis, lived down the street
during the previous year, at 516 Summit. The novel Lewis was working on,
about the recently deceased J.J. Hill, never was completed.</p>
<p>At Eagle Park we crossed to the less-desirable side of the street. By
the mid-1880s, Dolney said, bluff-side land that first sold for $1.50
an acre was going for $500 per frontal foot.</p>
<p>We passed a white pillared house Dolney called the &quot;Gone With the
Wind&quot; house and came to a Queen Anne-turned-Tudor that was for sale
for $1.885 million. On the sales flyer, Dolney looked in vain for the
annual property taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;They probably don't want you to know,&quot; she said. &quot;It's a lot,
usually about $30,000.&quot;</p>
<p>From there, we walked past painted ladies on Virginia Street to Laurel
Avenue and the richly embellished 1887 Richardsonian Romanesque
rowhouses where Fitzgerald lived briefly with his grandmother.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The walking tour ended at the 1915 limestone <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_of_Saint_Paul,_National_Shrine_of_the_Apostle_Paul">Cathedral of St.
Paul</a>, which a character in a Fitzgerald story called &quot;a plump white bulldog
on its haunches&quot; but which draws hordes of tourists not only for its
imposing facade but for its ornate interior, open to the public.</p>
<p>The houses on the rest of Summit Avenue, west of Dale, include Georgian
Revivals, Queen Annes and Italianesque manors that are only a little
smaller. At 1006 Summit, a 50,000-square-foot Tudor built in 1911 now is
the Governor's Residence.</p>
<p>William Mitchell College of Law is nearby, and farther down, Summit
splits into a boulevard, passing the campuses of Macalester College and
the University of St. Thomas. A few blocks later, it meets the
Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Today, Summit still is St. Paul's most prestigious address. It's just
as it was in the 1880s: If you live there, you've arrived.</p>
