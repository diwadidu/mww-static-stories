<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/a/nashua_quilt_barn.jpg" alt="Barn quilt in Iowa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Barn quilts have spread across Iowa; this one is just north of Nashua.

<p>There's just something about barns.</p>
<p>They appeal to everyone-city folk, country folk, anyone who's ever
played with a barn kitten. They're graceful structures, built in every
size and shape. And they evoke a nostalgia for simpler times, when
ordinary people who worked hard could prosper.</p>
<p>Many people like to drive around the countryside looking for them. But
they're disappearing fast.</p>
<h3>Iowa</h3>
<p>Iowa was first to form a preservation society, and every year, the <a href="http://www.iowabarnfoundation.org">Iowa
Barn Foundation</a> holds a statewide,
self-guided barn tour in fall.</p>
<p>It also holds a tour in June that rotates among regions.</p>
<p>Many Iowa counties also feature <a href="http://barnquiltinfo.com/map-IA.html">barns with
quilts</a>, a project that quickly
has spread across Iowa, bringing in tourists from across the country to
see barns adorned with colorful wooden blocks.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Sac County, in west-central Iowa, even has published a book, <a href="http://barnquilts.com/">&quot;Barn
Quilts of Sac County.&quot;</a></p>
<p>The foundation's web site contains maps and photos of dozens of
restored barns featured on past tours.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amanaheritage.org">Amana Heritage Society</a> hosts an
annual guided tour of 10 communal-era Amana Colonies barns. Cost is $25
and includes admission, transportation and snack.</p>
<p>In the west-central part of the state, the town of Manning includes a
handsome 1660 half-timbered brick
<a href="http://germanhausbarn.com/iowa_attractions/german-hausbarn/">Hausbarn</a>
brought over from the northern German state of Schleswig-Holstein and
reassembled with a roof thatched with reeds grown near the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.germanhausbarn.com/cms/">Hausbarn Heritage Park</a>
includes a 1915 restored Craftsman-style bungalow, a carriage house, a
1913 church and a gift shop. It's open daily from May through October.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Wisconsin also has many picturesque barns. In the coulee country of the
state's southwest corner, Vernon County is famous for its round barns,
many of them built by Alga Shivers, the son of freed slaves who became a
prominent citizen in the county's Cheyenne Valley.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/v/i/viroqua_round_barn.jpg" alt="A brick round barn near Viroqua in Vernon County." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Cina barn, near Viroqua in southwest Wisconsin, is one of 12 round
barns remaining in Vernon County.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Today, 12 <a href="http://www.westbywi.com/roundBarns.html">round barns</a> remain.
In Viroqua, the <a href="http://www.frontiernet.net/%7Evcmuseum/">Vernon County Historical
Society</a> sells &quot;Round Barns of
Vernon County,&quot; $12, 608-637-7396,  It's also available at Bramble
Press, 117 S. Main St. in Viroqua.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/vernon-county-wisconsin/">Valleys of Vernon
County</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/maps.aspx">Wisconsin's Rustic
Roads</a>
often lead to interesting barns. One near Wausau, R-47 between
Wittenberg and Tigerton , takes motorists past a gray round barn, an
aqua-blue barn, a red barn with rows of paned windows and a round barn
with a double-peaked roof, all within 14 miles.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/rustic-roads/">Wisconsin's Rustic
Roads</a>.</p>
<p>In cheese country, many <a href="http://www.greencountybarnquilts.com/inner.iml?mdl=locations.mdl">barns in Green
County</a>, around Monroe, sport quilts.</p>

<h3>Michigan</h3>

<p>On the second Saturday of October, historic barns are open during the
<a href="http://www.visitludington.com/stories/barns__bywaysfall_color_tour">Barns &amp; Byways
Tour</a>
in Mason County, around the Lake Michigan port town of Ludington.</p>
<h3>Illinois</h3>
<p>One of the nation's largest round barns is in <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/dnr/Parks/Pages/JohnsonSaukTrail.aspx">Johnson-Sauk Trail State
Recreation
Area</a>
in northwest Illinois, six miles south of Interstate 80 and five miles
north of Kewanee.</p>
<p>Built in 1910, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Round_Barn">Ryan Round
Barn</a> is more than 80
feet high. The Friends of Johnson's Park Foundation gives tours May
through October on the first, third and fifth Saturday of the month from
1 to 4 p.m.</p>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p>In southeast Minnesota , four &quot; <a href="https://www.rivertowns.net/business/tourism/6764316-Check-out-this-fading-barn-poetry-southwest-of-Red-Wing">poetry
barns</a>
&quot; near Red Wing have been a conversation piece since 1983, when
county extension agents around Minnesota got an unusual request: Could
they think of any barns that would make good canvases for poetry?</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The agent in Goodhue County warmed to the task, and soon four barns just
west of Red Wing-two along County Road 19 and one each along 6 and
1-bore verses, each describing one of the seasons.</p>
<p>Artist Mark Mendel from Massachusetts painted them as part of Word
Works, a festival sponsored by Walker Art Center and the Minneapolis
College of Art and Design.</p>
<p>On one County Road 19 barn, the poem became obscured when its owner put
on an addition. The full text is: &quot;Wind walking after the storm/Tracks
filling with moonlight/Stars in a mare's silhouette/Fenced snow waits
for dawn.&quot;</p>
<p>For directions, contact the <a href="mailto:goodhuecountyhis@qwest.net">Goodhue County Historical
Society</a>.</p>
<p>In the southeast tip of Minnesota, the town of
<a href="http://www.caledoniamn.gov">Caledonia</a> has started a Barn Quilt Tour,
with 27 barns sporting 8 by 8 squares in a variety of patterns. There's
a map on its web site.</p>
<p>The best selections of barns in Minnesota can be found in dairy country,
in such well-settled areas as Washington and Carver counties, says
photographer Doug Ohman.</p>
<p>His book &quot;Barns of Minnesota&quot; includes 85 full-color photos of barns.
Often the most scenic areas, such as Goodhue, Wabasha and Winona
counties in Mississippi Valley bluff country, also have the most scenic
barns, he says.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/e/red_wing_poetry_barn.jpg" alt="A poetry barn near Red Wing." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Poetry barns line a country road west of Red Wing, Minn.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>While creating the book, Ohman learned to identify Yankee threshing
barns, which have steep gables and few if any windows, and Dutch barns,
which have sloping roofs and sharp hay hoods.</p>
<p>Swedish barns have off-center doors, and German barns sometimes have an
extended forebay from which farmers could drop feed for their cows.</p>
<p>His book doesn't include locations or directions for Sunday drivers,
but Ohman supplied an <em>eastern Minnesota driving route</em> , below,
that includes two barns in Washington County and two in Chisago County,
half an hour northeast of the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>Starting in St. Paul, drive north on I-35E to Minnesota 36 and head
toward Stillwater. From 36, head north on Manning Avenue about 2½ miles
to Dellwood Road. Turn right, and in about a mile you will see an 1880s
Yankee post-and-beam barn (page 60).</p>
<p>Next, head north of Stillwater on Minnesota 95 to Minnesota 97 (about 15
miles). Turn left on 97 and drive to the small town of Scandia. Turn
left on Oakhill Road, and you will see an 1880s Swedish barn with an
off-center sliding door (page 69).</p>
<p>From Scandia, drive west on Minnesota 97 for 2½ miles. Turn right
(north) on County Road 1 and drive four miles across the Chisago County
line, where the road becomes County Road 24.</p>
<p>Between the road and Moody Lake, you'll see a 1915 round barn known as
the Moody Barn, listed on the National Register of Historic Places (page
48).</p>
<p>Continue into Chisago City and take U.S. 8 into Lindstrom and Center
City. From Center Center, take County Road 9 north through Sunrise and
Harris; it's a pretty route with many nice barns (not pictured in the
book).</p>
<p>From Harris, take I-35 north to the Rush City exit and head west on
County Road 1. On the east shore of Rush Lake, across from a campground,
you'll see twin 1930s barns (page 67).</p>
