<h2>At Glensheen, tourists walk into the life of an extraordinary family.</h2>

<p>It took a servant a day and a half to polish one of their chandeliers.
It took three Norwegian craftsmen three years to carve their woodwork.</p>
<p>Still, it's hard to begrudge Chester and Clara Congdon their nice
things, because apparently they were very nice people.</p>
<p>Chester gave 11 miles of Lake Superior shoreline to the people of Duluth
and made sure it was preserved for them in perpetuity.</p>
<p>Clara donated her time and resources to the Methodist church; her servants ate the same meals she did and were paid twice as much as other servants.</p>
<p>The couple slept together in a small bed, took their six kids and nephew
on vacations to historic sites and expositions and welcomed a constant
stream of friends and relatives to the home they called Glensheen.</p>
<p>&quot;The Congdons were very hospitable, they were very nice people,&quot;
guide Myrna Breivik said emphatically, when I toured the home. &quot;They
might have been rich, but they were very nice.&quot;</p>
<p>Their 1908 home is a monument to opulence, built at a time when wealth
was plowed into property, not stocks. But the couple was unusually down
to earth, for tycoons. Their fathers were Methodist pastors of modest
means, and the young people used church scholarships to attend Syracuse
University in New York.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They graduated in 1875 and planned to marry, but five years later, after
stints teaching in Chippewa Falls, Wis., and practicing law in St. Paul,
Chester still couldn't afford it: In an 1880 letter to Clara, he listed
his net worth as $9.67 in cash.</p>
<p>Within a year, however, his fortunes changed. He was taken under the
wing of Minnesota's U.S. attorney, whom he later followed to Duluth.</p>
<p>After a chance meeting with Henry Oliver, he served as legal counsel for
the Oliver Iron Mining Co. until U.S. Steel bought it in 1901. That
year, at age 48, Congdon began his own mining company.</p>
<p>And the riches rolled in. By the time he was building Glensheen five
years later, he was the second-richest man in Minnesota after St. Paul
railroad baron James J. Hill.</p>
<p>He had an uncanny ability to spot opportunity, making lucrative
investments not only in Duluth's timber, ore and shipping industries
but also in Washington state apple orchards and Arizona copper mines.</p>
<p>Clara Congdon, who taught while waiting for Chester to make good, had
earned her degree in art and architecture.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/l/glensheenlivingroom.jpg" alt="The living room of Glensheen." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Glensheen</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>&quot;Who could imagine such an opportunity as Glensheen, to put my
education to use creating a beautiful and gracious home?&quot; she wrote
in her journal.</p>
<p>Today, their home is owned by the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Tourists troop through on tours, gawking at the Quezal glass sconces and
chandeliers, the flamed-mahogany woodwork and Circassian-walnut
furniture, the silk-covered walls and 22-carat gold-leaf ceiling.</p>
<p>&quot;The 'Antiques Roadshow' would go crazy in here,&quot; Breivik said.</p>
<p>The Congdons, however, weren't ostentatious. Many of the objets d'art
are souvenirs, collected on their travels around the world, and many of
the paintings Clara did herself. None of the rooms is particularly
large.</p>
<p>The most fabulous room is the smallest: the Arts and Crafts breakfast
room, lined with windows, ferns and glowing green faience tiles.</p>
<p>When I visited Glensheen with friends one November, after the rooms had
been lavishly decorated for the holdiays, we started in the children's
playroom, where  our guide, opened a built-in bench filled with a jumble
of puzzles and games.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Imagine, they're from 1908 or 1910, and they're still here,&quot;
Breivik said. &quot;When the children married, they bought their own
mansions, and they bought their own stuff, I imagine.&quot;</p>
<p>She looked at us more closely and smiled. &quot;There are more than 300
Congond descendants, so if you're one, let me know, so I can get an
invitation to see one of those houses.&quot;</p>
<p>Our small group was on a Saturday Bedroom Slippers Tour, which meant we
could waltz behind the velvet ropes in little blue booties, inspecting
powder rooms and closets and even drawers.</p>
<p>In the living room, we stuck our noses as close as we could get to a
Japanese &quot;painting&quot; of a waterfall that actually was embroidered in
strands of silk thinner than a human hair and took 18 months to
complete.</p>
<p>We looked for each room's symbolic motif-lions, water lilies,
pomegranates-and in the daughter's bedrooms, we walked up to the
windows to see who had gotten the best views.</p>

<p>Elisabeth's room was smallest; she was the youngest daughter and never
married, caring for her mother until Clara died in 1950 at age 96.</p>
<p>Elisabeth, who was active in many charitable causes and founded what
became Duluth's Junior League, was still living in Glensheen when she
was murdered there in 1977, along with her elderly nurse.</p>
<p>The case was sensational, and eventually, the alcoholic husband of
Elisabeth's adopted daughter, Marjorie, confessed. Marjorie was charged
with murder but was found not guilty.</p>
<p>Since then, she has been in and out of the news, charged with bigamy and
the murder of her third husband (but not prosecuted) and convicted of
arson in Minnesota and attempted arson in Arizona.</p>
<p>In Arizona, she was sentenced to serve 15 years, and a request for early
parole was denied after being contested by at least 10 relatives. She
was released but later pleaded guilty to attempted forgery.</p>
<p>It's a sad and tawdry addendum to Condon history — but one whose
details fascinate the more than 100,000 people who go through the house
every year. That's a silver lining for a public institution that has to pay a million for a new roof.</p>
<p>But Clara Congdon, a principled woman who didn't even want hops grown
on the family's Washington ranch, would have been mortified by the
specter of notoriety that hangs over her lovely house, and the nearly 40
Congdons who still live around Duluth aren't happy about it, either.</p>

<p>For Elisabeth, vast riches were a gift that, in the end, turned on her.
But for the rest of Minnesota, Chester and Clara Congdon's legacy
simply is a gift.</p>
