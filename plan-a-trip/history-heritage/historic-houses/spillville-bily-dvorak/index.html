<h2>Dvorak's chosen spot</h2>
<p>IMG:RIGHT</p>
<p>In 1893, Spillville, Iowa, was just one rural burg among many in northeast Iowa's bluff country, except that it had an unusually lovely stone church, named for the 10th century Bohemian duke and martyr, Wenceslaus.</p>
<p>The Spillville church had a choir director, who had a musician son living in New York, who had a famous boss. The boss was the Czech composer Antonin Dvorak, who had come to America the previous year to head the National Conservatory of Music.</p>
<p>At the urging of his assistant, Dvorak, his wife and six children went to Iowa in June 1893 to spend the summer in Spillville, settled four decades earlier by emigrants from Bohemia.</p>
<p>The effect, for the little town of 400, was like a fairy kiss on the forehead. Dvorak wrote his ``American'' string quartet there; Spillville, associated with it and the famous ``New World'' symphony, written in New York, instantly became a part of music history.</p>
<p>In New York, the famous composer urged his students to look for inspiration in their own indigenous culture, as he had in the peasant music of Bohemia. It was a revolutionary idea that bore fruit, before too long, in the works of Charles Ives and, later, George Gershwin.</p>
<p>But for the residents of Spillville and their descendants, Dvorak's legacy was an enduring pride in their Old World roots.</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>In 1993, the town threw a huge 100th-anniversary party, drawing Antonin Dvorak III, IV and V from the Czech Republic, plus 20,000 musical scholars and tourists from 18 countries.</p>
<p>``Many came as a pilgrimage; they kind of view Spillville as a holy place,'' said festival organizer Michael Klimesh.</p>
<p>What Dvorak got in Spillville was a chance to recharge, to walk in forests and along rivers, listening to birds' songs and the rush of the wind; he is said to have jotted ideas in a notebook or on his cuffs as he rambled.</p>
<p>He walked along the Turkey River and went fishing with local boys; played St. Wenceslaus' organ for weddings and funerals; hung out with local men in the saloons, listening to stories in his native Czech and playing cards.</p>
<p>Today, his forests are largely gone, plowed under. There are trees in Riverside Park, where a boulder on a pedestal commemorates Dvorak and the compositions inspired by his stay, but not always pastoral silence. Instead, the Inwood, a white-frame country ballroom, once host to the Glenn Miller and Dorsey bands, fills the glade with country, rock and swing music.</p>
<p>But there are other places to invoke the Dvorak spirit: at St. Wenceslaus, where his aging organ sometimes is played at Mass; at the Old World Inn, an 1871 stone building with a restaurant that serves goulash, dumplings, cabbage rolls and kolache; at the lavender-and-gray B&amp;B across the street, where Clarabelle Taylor serves her guests jitrnice, patties made of spiced pork and barley; and at the boxy red-stone building that housed the Dvoraks and now is the home of a Dvorak museum.</p>
<p>The building also houses the Bily Clock Exhibit. Dvorak was not the only one to put Spillville on the map, and not the only one whose artistic output showed a deep-seated longing for the old country. Frank and Joseph Bily, whose parents were born in Prague, were young boys when the composer came to town.</p>
<p>They became bachelor farmers who whiled away the long winters carving fantastic clocks - or, more accurately, huge wooden scenes packed with moving figures, with a time-keeping mechanism attached.</p>
<p>The Bilys, who had a fifth-grade education and never traveled more than 35 miles from home, carved the Prague city square, Westminster Abbey and a village blacksmith shop; they carved Henrik Ibsen, Czech hero Jan Masaryk and J.J. Haug, the first postmaster of Spillville. Henry Ford is said to have offered $1 million for their American Pioneer History Clock, which includes 57 historical subjects, but they turned it down.</p>
<p>Their clocks are displayed at the museum on Main Street. With Dvorak playing in the background, young women give tours, their delivery as polished as the imported and native woods of the clocks' veneers. Joseph designed and joined the pieces, they say, and the carving was executed by Frank, whose skill with a knife showed up early.</p>
<p>Among the exhibits is a school desk he whittled so much it couldn't be used; the school eventually gave it to him, and he made it into a plaque of the holy family for his mother. The brothers died in 1964 and 1965.</p>
<p>Upstairs are the illustrated books from which the Bilys designed their clocks, the odd things they collected, and also the Dvorak display, with photos and text detailing his visit and various artifacts - two harmoniums he played, the last pipe he smoked; one of three reproductions of the bust on his tomb.</p>
<p>And now a log cabin, built as a schoolhouse, has been moved to the grounds of the Bily museum. It was built in 1854, the year the first Czechs arrived in Spillville.</p>
