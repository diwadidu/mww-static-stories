<p>In Minnesota, people value their own history so much that the Minnesota
Historical Society was founded nine years before the state itself.</p>
<p>No wonder the state's living-history sites are among the best in the
nation.</p>
<p>At a fur post, logging camp and fort, tourists get a peek into the past,
and schoolchildren learn their heritage at the feet of lumberjacks,
voyageurs, soldiers and farmers.</p>
<p>One of my favorite spots is in southeast bluff country-<a href="http://www.mnhs.org/places/sites/hf/">Historic
Forestville</a>, a rural village in
which time stopped in 1899.</p>
<p>The frontier folk are friendly and hospitable, but every time I go
there, they gently chastise me for showing up in my underwear. The last
time was no exception.</p>
<p>&quot;I see you haven't properly covered your limbs,&quot; said hired-help
Mary Maloney, looking at my shorts in the general store. &quot;Of course, I
know times have been hard.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In 1899, this rural village near Preston was fighting for its life. &quot;I
hope you'll consider settling here,&quot; Maloney said hopefully, after
she greeted us.</p>
<p>The postal service had started delivering mail to farmers, who no longer
had to visit the village store to get it. The railroad had bypassed
Forestville in 1868, and when people began leaving, Felix Meighen and
his son Thomas bought up their property and turned it into a company
town.</p>
<p>Thomas Meighen closed the store in 1910, but didn't sell it or its
inventory. Thanks to him and his daughter, Margaret, the Minnesota
Historical Society was able to turn their home, store and other
buildings into Historic Forestville, with interpreters playing the part
of the people who lived there.</p>
<p>Gardener Gottlieb Winter still cultivates chicory, citron melons and
ground cherries in the riverside garden, near an Ohio buckeye likely
planted by orator William Jennings Bryan, once the dinner guest of
Thomas Meighen (pronounced MEE'an).</p>
<p>Laborer Charlie Martin tends chickens and cuts wood, and Charles Ball
tends the store, offering to sell calico, 5 cents a yard, to the many
women who walk in wearing nothing but their &quot;drawers.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/o/forestville_chickens.jpg" alt="Feeding chickens at Historic Forestville." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

the kitchen.

<p>Mary Meighen is too polite to mention the ladies' attire, though she
herself is properly dressed in ankle-length dress and petticoats.
Apologizing for her husband's absence, she graciously shows her guests
into the parlor and serves sugar cookies just baked by the cook, Florie
Yaste.</p>
<p>They were all real people in 1899, the year the historical society
stopped time in Forestville. And they're real people today to thousands
of visitors who stream across a russet steel bridge to learn what life
was like in rural America.</p>
<p>Forestville, to which visitors must walk from a hidden parking lot
across the South Branch of the Root River, is perhaps the most charming
of Minnesota's historic sites.</p>
<p>It's hard to get the interpreters out of 1899, and they assume you're
from 1899, too.</p>
<p>In the general store, where many of the goods are left over from 1910,
Maloney showed us how we could make real coffee-scandalously
expensive at $1 a pound-last longer by adding &quot;essence of
coffee,&quot; or chicory, only 5 cents a can.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>And she showed us the stiff, sharp-cornered men's collars: &quot;If my
husband falls asleep in church, his chin hits it and it wakes him right
up,&quot; she said with relish.</p>
<p>In the barn, the largest in Fillmore County when it was built,
hired-hand Louis Grabau showed us a new buggy, complete with suspension,
which he was readying for his boss to take into Preston.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. Meighen is fond of his Sears &amp; Roebuck catalog,&quot; he said with a
wink.</p>
<p>He also showed us how to shuck corn, which we tried to feed to the
heritage chickens. They'd been entertaining us all morning with their
odd leaps and dashes around the yard, led by a rooster named Bill for
current president William McKinley.</p>
<p>&quot;They're not interested if you come out of the place with the corn,
only if you come out of the gates with bread or cake,&quot; said kitchen
assistant Nellie Moyles.</p>
<p>She recruited Mary Meighen from the kitchen, and sure enough, Bill ran
right out of the barn, followed by the hens and chicks.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/r/preston_forestville_treats.jpg" alt="Interpreters at Historic Forestville." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Another year, I was there for an Evening of Leisure. In the yard of the
Meighen house, Thomas' sister Martha Meighen and Florie were serving
slices of steamed pudding, ginger cookies and tin wedding cake with
chunks of citron melon.</p>
<p>Nellie was playing croquet with a young guest, and Charles Ball was
leading a game of horseshoes. On the other side of a white picket fence,
people cantered by on horses.</p>
<p>On the lawn, Gottlieb was entertaining guests on upright bass, with
friends on mouth harp and guitar. Soon we all were standing in a circle
doing what the musicians announced was the Twirly Whirly, a &quot;new dance
from New York City&quot;-what we call these days the Hokey Pokey.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't been this dizzy since the last time I went to Wykoff,&quot;
announced handyman John Maloney, to which a scandalized Martha Meighen
replied, &quot;Oh, Mr. Maloney!&quot;</p>
<p>Maloney liked whiskey, and thanks to Thomas Meighen's exhaustive
records, the staff knows exactly how much of it he bought from the
store, if not from the saloon in Wykoff. In the store, there's a
replica of the ledger, copied in ink by park staff and open to the
corresponding date in 1899.</p>
<p>By 8 p.m., the musicians were playing by lantern light, fog was rolling
in over the fields and everyone was singing &quot;My Bonnie Lies Over the
Ocean.&quot;</p>
<p>Over by the fence, a St. Paul woman and her teen-age niece were playing
checkers around a wooden barrel.</p>
<p>&quot;It gets you to thinking,&quot; she said. &quot;Nowadays, kids are stuck to the
TV, bored, saying, 'What am I gonna do?' It amazes me-I don't think
people today get where their parents and grandparents come from. I wish
my folks would've shared with me what it was like then.&quot;</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: <a href="http://sites.mnhs.org/historic-sites/historic-forestville">Historic Forestville</a> in southeast Minnesota</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : The park is between Spring Valley, Wykoff and Preston,
not far from
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Lanesboro</a>.</p>
<p>From Minnesota 16 south of Wykoff, head four miles south on County Road
5, then two miles east on County Road 118. Historic Forestville can be
reached only through the park.</p>
<p><em>Admission and hours</em> : It's open Thursday through Sunday from Memorial
Day weekend to Labor Day and Saturdays in September and October.
Admission is $8, $6 for children 6-17. State-park vehicle permits also
are required.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : There are five camper cabins with screened porches as
well as camping in <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/forestville_mystery_cave/index.html">Forestville/Mystery Cave State
Park</a>, which is known for its trout fishing and horse-riding trails.</p>
<p>The park also has the advantage of having very few mosquitoes in summer,
thanks to the excellent drainage provided by the porous limestone right
under the surface.</p>
<p><em>Cave tours</em> : Tours are offered of Mystery Cave near the campground as
well as Niagara Cave, just to the east near Harmony.</p>
