<p>In a bucolic corner of southeast Wisconsin, a famous acting couple
created a retreat unlike any other.</p>
<p>Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Milwaukee-born Alfred
Lunt and his English wife, Lynn Fontanne, dominated the Broadway and
London stage, where they were known as &quot;the Fabulous Lunts.&quot;</p>
<p>They had so much star power they took only roles that allowed them to
work together-and to spend summers at their beloved country house
near the village of Genesee Depot.</p>
<p>They called it Ten Chimneys, and frequent visitors included Noel Coward,
Laurence Olivier, Helen Hayes, Katharine Hepburn and Carol Channing, who
cherished the invitations: &quot;When you went to Ten Chimneys, it meant you
must have done something right,&quot; she said</p>
<p>It wasn't a prestigious vacation area, like nearby Lake Geneva, nor did
it have a panoramic view. It was just a patch of kettle moraine, with
Yankee farmers for neighbors.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On it, they built a highly theatrical backdrop for their remarkable
lives. Today, it's a National Historic Landmark and open for tours,
which are fascinating.</p>
<p>Lunt and his family often had picnicked in the area, and in 1915, at age
23, he bought three acres and started building a house.</p>
<p>After he and Fontanne married, they turned the chicken coop into a
cottage and added another 57 acres plus a pool and pool house,
timber-frame studio and farm buildings, including a creamery and
greenhouse.</p>
<p>&quot;He had a place to tend his garden, literally and figuratively,&quot;
said our white-gloved guide, Dan Cummings.</p>
<p>It wasn't ostentatious, but no one would mistake it for a typical
Midwestern home. Every room was a stage set-literally in the case of
the Flirtation Room, a rehearsal space that has five entrances.</p>
<p>In the dining room, there's a majolica bust of a courtesan with one
bare breast. Rooms glow from quantities of gilt, crystal and mirrors,
two of them from Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lunt_fontanne.jpg" alt="Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt were known as "The Fabulous Lunts."
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The walls and ceilings are covered with Swedish-primitive-rococo murals
painted by their set-designer friend <a href="http://www.claggettwilson.com/bab.html">Claggett
Wilson</a>, who came to visit in
1938 and stayed for more than two years.</p>
<p>It became just the kind of house Fontanne wanted, as personal as a
diary.</p>
<p>&quot;I think living in a modern house all the rest of my life would be just
like sitting nude forever in the center of a huge white dinner
plate,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>All of the couple's mementos and favorite possessions remain in the
house, and it's easy to imagine Lynn making a grand entrance and
greeting guests with her habitual &quot;Welcome, darlings.&quot;</p>
<p>The dining room is set for a dinner party, with Meissen china and chair
cushions that Lynn embroidered with the signs of the Zodiac. The bons
mots and double entendres must have flowed-Noël Coward, their best
friend, wrote of five-hour dinner parties during which &quot;we never drew
breath.&quot;</p>
<p>The Lunts were legendary hosts. One room was just for Helen Hayes, who
came to stay for a month at a time and called the Lunts &quot;my idols.&quot;
When a theater on Broadway was renamed the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in
1958, she sent the couple a warm congratulatory note using the lyrics of
Lerner and Loewe's &quot;On the Street Where You Live,&quot; and it remains
in the room.</p>
<p>Katharine Hepburn came and said, &quot;Every time I was visiting the Lunts
in Genesee Depot, I was in a sort of daze of wonder.&quot;</p>
<p>Alfred's mother lived in the red Swedish cottage, which they called the
Hen House. Lunt, who had an eye for antiques, filled it with Swedish
folk art and his own stencils and painting, including a grocery list in
Swedish on the kitchen door (the word fisk he painted in red-perhaps
his red herring).</p>
<p>New York Times theater critic Alexander Woollcott was a frequent guest
there and had a birch grove planted outside the red cottage, saying it
&quot;needed more color.&quot;</p>
<p>The couple were frugal, even cheap. When British interior decorator
Syrie Maugham wanted Lunt to buy a $4,000 wool carpet for one of her
white bedrooms, he had a Milwaukee tannery make one of sheepskins for
$70. Fontanne sewed her own gowns and the houses' curtains.</p>
<p>And yet they rejected a million-dollar Hollywood film contract, saying
they &quot;could be bought but not bored.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/e/ten_chimneys_main_house.jpg" alt="The main house of Ten Chimneys." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The main house has six of the estate's 10 chimneys, most from Swedish
tiled stoves.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>They both loved to putter around the estate. Lunt was &quot;deliriously
happy&quot; making jelly, baking bread, weeding and splitting wood. Lynn
fished and tended the flower garden.</p>
<p>The attention they lavished on Ten Chimneys was an extension of their
acting discipline. The Lunts became famous because, in large part, they
worked harder than anyone else.</p>
<p>&quot;Directing Lunt is a revelation,&quot; British director Peter Brook said.
&quot;You can't imagine the countless tiny details that Alfred puts into a
performance. This may sound like finicky acting, but these painstaking
details make up an enormous conception. It is like one of Seurat's
pointillist paintings. Each little dot is not art, but the whole is
magnificent.&quot;</p>
<p>Lunt died in 1977 and Fontanne-who never told her husband she was 4½
years older-in 1983 at age 95.</p>
<p>Lunt's family continued to care for the estate, but by 1996, Ten
Chimneys was slated to be torn down and the land developed for condos. A
Madison-area restaurateur and arts advocate sold his restaurant to save
the estate and started the Ten Chimneys Foundation.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In 1998, it bought the estate from him and, after a $12.5 million
restoration, opened it to the public in 2003.</p>
<p>Today, Ten Chimneys preserves a bygone era of theater history. They
don't make 'em like that anymore-neither the house nor the couple.</p>
