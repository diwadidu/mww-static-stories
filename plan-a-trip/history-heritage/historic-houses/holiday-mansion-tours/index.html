<h2>For Christmas tours, historic mansions up the ante on opulence.</h2>

The Alexander Ramsey House in St. Paul was the home of Minnesota's
first territorial governor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Two centuries ago, Minnesota and Wisconsin were ripe for the picking.</p>
<p>Iron ore lay under forests of tall white pine, fertile farmland lay
under prairie grasses, and rivers teeming with beaver led to the Great
Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>It all turned into money when ambitious men arrived, gathering up the
goodies like kids on Halloween. They logged, they mined, they traded and
they shipped.</p>
<p>The men who made the biggest fortunes did it all, plowing their first
round of profits into railroads, land and banking.</p>
<p>Then, they built houses.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, the two richest men built the two biggest houses. James J.
Hill, who started as a clerk on the St. Paul levee, was a railroad baron
but also dabbled in mining, shipping, banking and milling.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Chester Congdon, a pastor's son who was a teacher before he began
practicing law, had an uncanny eye for opportunity and speculated in
timber, iron ore, apples and copper.</p>
<p>Congdon's counterpart across the harbor in Superior, Wis., was Martin
Pattison, whose 1891 home was the Twin Ports' first grand mansion.</p>
<p>Pattison, a lumber baron who made even more money mining iron ore he
discovered himself in the Vermilion Range near Ely, Minn., later was
found to have abandoned a wife and children in Michigan and changed his
name.</p>
<p>The lifestyles of yesteryear's rich and famous are just as interesting
as those of today, and usually more so. The people are gone, but the
houses tell the stories.</p>
<p>These magnificent houses were places where their owners could impress
clients and make even more money, and they also served as investments in
the days before the stock market.</p>

In Rochester, the expansive grounds of Mayowood are decorated for the

<p>On a hill overlooking downtown St. Paul, James J. Hill built a
36,000-square-foot Romanesque mansion of red sandstone, bristling with
chimneys for 22 fireplaces.</p>
<p>On the shore of Lake Superior in Duluth, Chester Congdon built a 39-room
Jacobean brick castle, filled with intricately carved woodwork of fumed
oak, Circassian walnut and acid-distressed cypress, with furniture to
match.</p>
<p>Lumber barons built houses from Superior to Dubuque. Pioneering
physicians built a manse in Rochester, and a beer magnate built a
Germanic palace in Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Now open to the public, these homes contain luxuries to an almost
dizzying degree: ceilings covered in 22-carat gold, walls covered with
silk, fireplaces of onyx and marble, silver chandeliers that took a
servant an entire day to polish.</p>
<p>During the holidays, all of this opulence will be gilded with an
eye-popping array of velvet ribbons, frosted roses, silver balls, golden
garlands and, of course, decorated trees.</p>
<p>Below are some of the most notable grand mansions that offer holiday
tours in <em>2019</em> .</p>
