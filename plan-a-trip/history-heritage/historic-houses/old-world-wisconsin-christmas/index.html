<h2>At Old World Wisconsin, pioneers party like it's 1899.</h2>

<p>Once, every child in America celebrated Christmas without
battery-operated toys.</p>
<p>Instead, they played flap jacks and dominos. They made paper ornaments
for the tree. They got an orange brought all the way from Florida.</p>
<p>That's still what kids do during Christmas time at Old World Wisconsin,
where it's always the 19th century. Danish, Norwegian, German, Polish,
Finnish and Yankee families toil there, trying to get ahead on the
American frontier.</p>
<p>The buildings, brought in from homesteads all over Wisconsin and
reconstructed here, at America's largest outdoor museum of rural life,
would be familiar to the real pioneers.</p>
<p>There's a Finnish sauna, an octagonal barn, a stovewood cottage, a
schoolhouse and Milwaukee's first Catholic church.</p>
<p>And they'd recognize themselves — at Old World Wisconsin, costumed
interpreters portray the real people who lived and worked in the
buildings, placed around 576 acres in the middle of Southern Kettle
Moraine State Forest.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When we went one December, however, the first character we saw was
folkloric, conceived in Europe and brought to life by an American
magazine illustrator during the Civil War.</p>
<p>He was a Thomas Nast Santa Claus, with a suit of maroon fur and a
henna-colored fur hat with a fur pompon and sprig of holly, an English
talisman to guarantee sweet dreams.</p>
<p>&quot;The original color was brown, like bear fur, but on the glass plates
they used for illustrations, it came out brownish maroon,&quot; said Norm
Anderson of Pewaukee, who played Santa.</p>
<p>The pipe-smoking Thomas Nast Santa remained lodged in the national
imagination until 1931, when a red-suited, roly-poly Santa was
introduced in Coca-Cola advertisements.</p>
<p>Still, with the twinkle in his eye and a curly white beard — both real
— Anderson's Santa looked plenty familiar to a little girl named
Julianna.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you the real Santa?&quot; she asked. &quot;Can I ask you a quiz question?
What's our address?&quot; He'd have to check his address book, Anderson
replied, but he was sure she was on his &quot;good&quot; list.</p>
<p>From the yard of the 1897 Clausing Barn, which serves as Old World
Wisconsin's restaurant, we walked to the Caldwell Farmer's Club Hall,
built in 1874 and 1880 and restored to the year 1900.</p>

<p>Children were playing with homemade wooden toys and making paper-boat
ornaments to honor St. Basil, who travels by boat each Christmas to
bring presents to Greek children.</p>
<p>The hall's stage was filled with treasures from Greek-American homes —
a mandolin, a bottle of ouzo, a hand-embroidered bedspread, icons of
saints, a New Year's vasilopita cake with &quot;1921&quot; spelled out in
blanched almonds and a gold coin from St. Basil hidden inside.</p>
<p>Many of the treasures came from the family of Katherine Fafalios of
Edgerton, whose grandfathers came to Wisconsin in 1907 and 1915 from
villages outside Istanbul; one sent away for a Greek &quot;picture bride&quot;
named Katherine, who became her grandmother.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't realize what a passion I had for this history before I started
researching it,&quot; said Fafalios, who was at the hall to talk about Greek
traditions. &quot;The family ties, the music and dancing, enjoying life —
you'll still find them in Greek homes.&quot;</p>
<p>Down the road at Harmony Town Hall, a retired professor from Columbia
University was in town to visit his daughter and had been asked to
recite Clement Moore's &quot;A Visit From St. Nicholas,&quot; or &quot; 'Twas the
Night Before Christmas.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Clement Moore was an academic, a Biblical scholar and the son of the
Columbia University president. For Christmas 1822, he wrote a poem for
his children, and the next year his wife sent it to the Troy Sentinel in
New York, which published it anonymously in 1823.</p>
<p>&quot;He published lots of things, but nobody remembers anything except the
one piece he didn't want published,&quot; said Lee Lovas of Hartland,
playing the fictional Abraham Perkins, a Columbia professor visiting his
daughter Elizabeth in Harmony in 1872.</p>
<p>He passed around a facsimile of the Troy Sentinel of Dec. 23, 1823, with
Moore's poem running down the middle of the page in small type.</p>
<p>It was revolutionary, he said, in that St. Nick was depicted as a
regular person who rewarded all children, rich and poor: &quot;Suddenly,
Christmas could be celebrated by all classes,&quot; Lovas said.</p>
<p>Over at the Benson House, we saw how a middle-class Yankee family
celebrated Christmas in 1875. On a tabletop, a tree was decorated with
strands of popcorn, U.S. flags, walnuts and paper cones; its candles
were lit for 10 minutes on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>The aromas of roasting turkey, stuffing, creamed turnips and potato
croquettes wafted from the kitchen, and a bowl of mincemeat was ready
for pie — mincemeat as black as tar, made of suet, raisins, citron,
currants, sugar, spices and brandy.</p>

Yankee homesteads.

<p>A woman in a gray bustle, fitted gray jacket and high-necked blouse —
Sophia Benson or her widowed daughter Emma; she didn't say — showed us
the intricate seed flowers she'd made: &quot;It's something you do to while
away the cold days,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In the Grotelueschen Blacksmith Shop, the blacksmith was using his
bellows on a pile of coal, making it glow red. As he talked, the iron he
was holding over the fire started to melt; quickly, he pulled it out,
pounded it with a mallet and gave it a twist. In a minute, he had a
decorative eyehole hook.</p>
<p>At the Thomas General Store, the shopkeeper had laid in a supply of
oysters and dried cod, which pioneers creamed for Christmas dinners, and
oranges for children's stockings.</p>
<p>He also had year-round luxuries, such as green coffee beans, bricks of
tobacco and bolts of Chinese silk.</p>
<p>&quot;So you know who helped make that cheaper?&quot; asked the shopkeeper,
played by Norm Lembach of Elkhorn. &quot;Pirates, who sold it for a fraction
of their value. It's one way poorer people could get some of the fancier
fabrics — everything came through England, and England taxed
everything to death.&quot;</p>
<p>He had another trivia question for us, pointing at a wooden box of tea
labeled Pacific Steamship Co.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;What company did that become?&quot; he said. &quot;A&amp;P, for Atlantic and Pacific
Tea. Co.&quot;</p>
<p>We finished our tour of the 19th century in St. Peter's Church, called
St. Luke's in 1839, when it became Milwaukee's first Catholic church.</p>
<p>We listened to Kapellmeister Ed Pierce play &quot;Joy to the World&quot; on his
fife, then joined in on &quot;Silent Night,&quot; in English and German, and
listened to recitations of the Christmas story.</p>
<p>In the corner, the boughs of a Christmas tree were laden with gifts —
gloves, mittens, bonnets, cones full of candy. Larger gifts, such as
stereoscopes, timepieces and doll's cradles, lay underneath. There was a
bit of gossip about that — it seems a handsome young farmer had
brought a gift for a certain eligible young woman.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a community Christmas tree,&quot; Pierce said. &quot;Farm chores were
so demanding people didn't have time for the frivolity of a Christmas
tree, but they didn't neglect Christmas, either.&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks to the skills of Old World Wisconsin's interpreters, the joys of
Christmas past become the joys of Christmas present for those who visit
every year.</p>
