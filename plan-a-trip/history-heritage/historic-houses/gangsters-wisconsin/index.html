FBI agents prepared for their raid on Little Bohemia at Voss' Birchwood

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In 1920, northern Wisconsin already was a playground for people from
Chicago.</p>
<p>And when Prohibition flung open the door to organized crime, its remote
lakes and forests became even more attractive to a certain kind of
Chicagoan.</p>
<p>Al Capone had a fortified summer home on a lake near Hayward, to which
hydroplanes flew whiskey from Canada.</p>
<p>His lieutenants frequented the saloons and brothels in Hurley. Rival
Roger Touhy vacationed in Minocqua, fishing with a machine gun.</p>
<p>By 1934, Prohibition was over but the Depression was in full swing, and
many people blamed the banks.</p>
<p>John Dillinger was the most-wanted bank robber, and he made a resort in
Manitowish Waters famous when the FBI interrupted his stay there,
killing a local but allowing Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson and the other
men to escape.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The spectacularly botched raid of Little Bohemia Lodge is at the center
of the film &quot;Public Enemies,&quot; starring Johnny Depp as Dillinger
and Christian Bale as FBI agent Melvin Purvis. It was filmed at Little
Bohemia and around Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Now it's tourists who are hot on the gangsters' trail, not FBI agents.</p>
<p>Over the years, Little Bohemia has hosted throngs of what it calls
&quot;bullet-hole customers,&quot; named for the holes that still can be seen.
In April 1934, Dillinger had just been wounded in a shootout with the
FBI in St. Paul.</p>
<p>His girlfriend, Billie Frechette, raised on northeast Wisconsin's
Menominee Indian Reservation, was in custody.</p>
<p>He and his gang decided to get away and regroup. The owner of their
favorite tavern in Chicago recommended a lodge in Wisconsin's north
woods, run by a friend.</p>
<p>Manitowish was the kind of place where &quot;every little lake had at least
one illegal still working overtime,&quot; writes Bryan Burrough, author of
the book on which the film is based, &quot;Public Enemies, America's
Greatest Crime Wave and the Birth of the FBI, 1933-34.&quot;</p>
<p>Nan LaPorte used to run her brother's moonshine downstate, and that's
where she met Emil Wanatka.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/manitowish_bohemia.jpg" alt="Little Bohemia Lodge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Parts of "Public Enemies" were shot at Little Bohemia Lodge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>They married and ran the Little Bohemia bar in Chicago, &quot;a favorite of
underworld figures,&quot; Burrough writes, before returning to her home in
Manitowish. In 1931, they built a roadhouse on Star Lake.</p>
<p>When the party of 10 from Chicago showed up on a cold day in April, the
Wanatkas were happy for the business.</p>
<p>But Emil recognized Dillinger, and Nan eventually grew worried and told
her sister, who ran a resort down the road with her husband, Henry
Voss.</p>
<p>Voss called the FBI and drew a map of Little Bohemia for agents. Its
failure to mention Nan Wanatka's two watchdogs was only one of many
miscalculations.</p>
<p>The gang had decided to leave early and was packing when the dogs
started barking. Nervous FBI agents opened fire on three customers who
were leaving after dinner, killing one and wounding the others.</p>
<p>Dillinger jumped out a window and ran away unnoticed. Baby Face Nelson
ran another way, killed an FBI agent and wounded another agent and a
constable. Then he stole their car.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, FBI agent Melvin Purvis sat in the driveway until dawn,
thinking he had Dillinger trapped.</p>
<p>(In the film, however, Dillinger trades machine-gun fire with agents
from inside the lodge and then is pursued through the woods; it's one
of many discrepancies.)</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The escape was a national scandal, embarrassing FBI director J. Edgar
Hoover. The ensuing manhunt ended that summer when agents gunned down
Dillinger outside the Biograph Theater in Chicago.</p>
<p>The gang had left many belongings at Little Bohemia, and after
Dillinger's death, the lodge installed a museum. For a while, John
Dillinger's father and sister ran it.</p>
<p>The lodge no longer rents rooms, but it operates a gift shop and
restaurant, and its slogan is &quot;Dillinger only left because he had
to.&quot;</p>
<p>After the escape, gang member John Hamilton was shot by police from
Hastings, Minn., as he, Homer Van Meter and Dillinger headed for St.
Paul. Tommy Carroll, who already had reached St. Paul, was killed in
June by police in Waterloo, Iowa.</p>
<p>Van Meter was killed that August by police in St. Paul. Baby Face Nelson
died that November in a shootout on an Illinois highway.</p>
<p>Wisconsin's northwoods remained popular with gangsters. Ralph Capone, a
mob cashier who served more than two years for income-tax evasion,
bought a bar in Mercer, ran slot machines and was a popular resident
until his death in 1974.</p>
<p>Sam Giancana brought his family to vacation in Rhinelander. Joe Saltis
bought a lodge near Winter. Jimmy Hoffa was a patron of Jack O'Lantern
Lodge in Eagle River, and the woods surrounding it were searched when he
disappeared.</p>

<h3>The resorts</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.manitowishwaters.org/">Manitowish Waters</a>.</strong> <a href="http://www.littlebohemialodge.com">Little Bohemia
Lodge</a>, 26 miles north of Minocqua,
serves a traditional northwoods menu of steak and seafood and is open
daily for dinner. In summer, it also serves lunch and breakfast every
day except Tuesday. There's a gift shop. 715-543-8800.</p>
<p>A mile south, <a href="http://www.vossbl.com/">Voss' Birchwood Lodge</a> was the
staging area for the FBI's assault on Little Bohemia. It has a main
lodge and cottages on Spider Lake. 715-543-8441.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/lac-du-flambeau-ojibwe-culture/">Lac du
Flambeau</a>.</strong>   After he killed FBI agent Carter Baum and
stole his car at Little Bohemia, Baby Face Nelson headed west. When the
car threw a rod, he walked 20 miles through forest and ended up at
<a href="http://www.dillmans.com">Dillman's Bay Resort</a>.</p>
<p>He spent three nights in a maple-sugar shack, now Cabin 5, with an
elderly Ojibwe couple before stealing a car and heading for Chicago.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Today, the fourth generation is running the resort, on a peninsula on
White Sand Lake, 20 miles northwest of Minocqua. It's known for its
creative art workshops, held from mid-May to mid-October.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/minocqua-wisconsin-lake-vacation/">Minocqua</a>.</strong>
The busy Island City was as popular with Chicagoans then as it is now.</p>
<p>Two miles west of town, at the end of a long driveway, <a href="http://www.norwoodpines.com">Norwood Pines
Supper Club</a> was a popular gangster
hangout, with gambling and a brothel upstairs, according to the late Tom
Hollatz in his book &quot;Gangster Holidays, the Lore and Legends of the Bad
Guys.&quot; It's off Wisconsin 70 on Patricia Lake.</p>
<p>BJ's Sportshop on U.S. 51 was the home of Trixie's, &quot;the most famous
whorehouse in the northwoods,&quot; Hollatz writes. The Belle Isle Sports
Bar &amp; Grille, at 301 E. Front St., had a direct phone line to Arlington
Park racetrack in Chicago.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/indulgent-retreats/hayward-wisconsin-shops-inns/">Hayward
area</a>.</strong>
South of Hayward, near Couderay, a 1925 stone-and-log house was Al
Capone's summer home on Cranberry Lake, to which hydroplanes flew
whiskey from Canada. It has a machine-gun turret and and eight-car
garage, and it was built for a wary comfort.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minocqua_supper_club.jpg" alt="Norwood Pines Supper Club in Minocqua." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Norwood Pines Supper Club was a popular gangster hangout in Minocqua.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Two mahogany spiral staircases lead to corner bedrooms along walkways
that have a full view of the living room; in Capone's bedroom, a switch
worked all the yard lights.</p>
<p>For many years, it was privately operated as Al Capone's Hideout, with tours and a
restaurant in the garage, but it closed without notice in 2009
and sold at auction.</p>
<p>East of Couderay, near Winter, Chicago gang leader and speakeasy
operator &quot;Polack Joe&quot; Saltis built a cedar log lodge on Barker Lake in
the 1920s, with cabins &quot;where visiting 'firemen,' or 'blazers'
(gunmen) could relax away from the heat,&quot; Hollatz wrote.</p>
<p>It's now the <a href="https://www.legacylodgewi.com/">Legacy Lodge</a>, with accommodations in the
lodge and six 1920s log cabins. It also has a nine-hole golf course
built by Saltis, who retired there in 1930.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-cable-wisconsin/">Cable</a>:</strong>  Just east of
town, a 1927 resort on Lake Namekagon is rooted in Prohibition-era
notoriety, though not gangsters.</p>
<p>It was built by wealthy Chicago businessman Jacob Loeb as a retreat
after the sensational 1924 trial of his teen-aged nephew, Richard Loeb,
who was convicted with friend Nathan Leopold of murdering a young boy
for the thrill of it.</p>
<p>It was Jacob Loeb who paid celebrated lawyer Clarence Darrow to save his
nephew from the electric chair, which he did.</p>

Hurley's main street still is lined with saloons and strip clubs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Today, it's called <a href="http://www.garmischresort.com/">Garmisch USA</a>, for
the famous Bavarian ski resort, and its lodge and cabins have a medieval
hunting-lodge motif. Lodge rooms and the restaurant have great views of
Lake Namekagon.</p>
<p>For more about Garmisch and similar lodges, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/cozy-lodges/">Classic Wisconsin
lodges</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hurleywi.com/">Hurley</a>:</strong> This town, adjoining Ironwood,
Mich., is in a mining district and was known as the roughest town in the
Upper Midwest.</p>
<p>Silver Street was packed with saloons and brothels, and according to
Hollatz, the Capone mob brought teen girls there with the promise of
dancing jobs, then trained them as pickpockets or forced them into
prostitution.</p>
<p>Even today, Silver Street has a faintly menacing air, especially where
it dips past a small gantlet of &quot;gentlemen's clubs&quot; before transforming
into the cheerily bourgeois main street of Ironwood.</p>
<h3>Filming sites</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.visitoshkosh.com">Oshkosh</a>.</strong> Crews filmed two famous
Dillinger robberies here, with a downtown bank/office building standing
in for the Security National Bank and Trust in Sioux Falls, S.D., and
Oshkosh's Masonic Temple standing in for the American Bank and Trust
Co. in Racine, Wis.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.columbuswichamber.com/">Columbus</a>.</strong> This entire downtown
of Columbus, 25 miles northeast of Madison, is on the National Register
of Historic Places, and it stood in for Greencastle, Ind., where
Dillinger and his gang robbed a bank in October 1933, netting $75,000.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/o/columbus_public_enemies.jpg" alt="Filming of " /><p class="copyright">&copy; Rod Melotte</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Exterior bank scenes were shot at the West James Gallery, which once was
the First National Bank and now includes the visitors center.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-summer-madison-wisconsin/">Madison</a>.</strong> The interior and exterior of the state Capitol stood in for FBI
headquarters, with Billy Crudup playing J. Edgar Hoover. Free tours are
given daily.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.beaverdamchamber.com/">Beaver Dam</a>.</strong> The historic Hotel
Rogers in Beaver Dam, now an apartment building called The Rogers, stood
in for Tucson's Hotel Congress, the site of the Dillinger gang's
capture after a fire broke out and authorities recognized them.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.darlingtonwi.org/">Darlington</a>.</strong> In this town south of
Mineral Point, the Lafayette County Courthouse stood in for the Lake
County Courthouse in Crown Point, Ind., where Dillinger was arraigned.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/summer-milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a>.</strong> The <a href="http://www.milwaukeehistory.net">Milwaukee County Historical
Society</a> building on Old World Third
Street in Milwaukee, a former bank, was converted back into a bank by
film crews; the interior scenes of the Greencastle robbery were shot
there.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Delton.</strong> The grounds of <a href="http://www.ishnala.com">Ishnala</a>
restaurant, a 1953 restaurant on Mirror Lake that includes parts of a
1909 log home, were used by film crews.</p>
<p>For more on the movie, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Enemies_(2009_film)">Public
Enemies</a> Wiki
site. Many YouTube videos feature filming at sites in Wisconsin and
especially Johnny Depp, who was gracious to his many fans.</p>
