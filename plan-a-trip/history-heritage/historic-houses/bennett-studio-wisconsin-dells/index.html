Bennett's Wisconsin Dells</h1>
<h2>Thanks to a 19th-century photographer, tourists flooded in to see the famous rock formations for themselves.</h2>

<p>H.H. Bennett wanted tourists to come to the Wisconsin Dells, and thanks
to him, they came.</p>
<p>Boy, did they come.</p>
<p>In Bennett's day, they stayed for weeks, playing croquet and checkers
and going on picnics, boat excursions on the Wisconsin River and perhaps
to a magic-lantern show of stereoscope slides from Bennett's studio.</p>
<p>Now they stay only a few days, but they come in droves, flocking to
thrill rides and theme parks, magic shows and musical revues. The Dells
today are a first-rate tourist trap — and the pioneering photographer
might have been fine with that.</p>
<p>&quot;He has given to the Dells a notoriety which it could have gained in no
other way,&quot; the Wisconsin Mirror said of Bennett in 1884.</p>
<p>Young Henry Hamilton Bennett wanted to be a carpenter, but his right
hand was crippled during the Civil War when his gun accidentally
discharged.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He became a photographer instead, supporting his family through his
portrait studio but also by selling photographs of the sandstone
formations and shadowy gulches of the Dells, a 15-mile gorge created by
a sudden flood at the end of the Ice Age.</p>
<p>He was a tireless promoter and businessman, taking photos as steamboats
arrived, rushing to his studio to develop the glass negatives and
returning to hawk prints to passengers.</p>
<p>He named landmarks to make them more appealing to tourists — Witches
Gulch, Romance Cliff — and sometimes whitewashed the interiors of
caves so they'd show up better on his negatives.</p>
<p>To increase revenue, he invented devices that allowed him to produce
75,000 stereoscope cards a month.</p>
<p>H.H. Bennett was a working man, yes — but he also was a brilliant
artist and innovator.</p>

<p>&quot;I have digital and everything, and I can't take a picture the way he
did 100 years ago,&quot; said Annie Kurtz, a Dells native. &quot;And he had a bad
right hand.&quot;</p>
<p>Even more important, he loved his subject. Other pioneering
photographers became famous by portraying the majestic mountain ranges of
the West.</p>
<p>But Bennett stayed in Wisconsin, shooting fishermen, logging-camp cooks
and picnickers: &quot;I had many opportunities to photograph the West, but I
never traveled to record other terrain,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;My energies for near a lifetime have been used almost entirely to win
such prominence as I could in outdoor photography, and in this effort I
could not help falling in love with the Dells,&quot; he said the year before
his death.</p>
<p>Bennett's family continued to operate his studio after he died in 1908,
and when it closed in 1998, it was considered the oldest continuously
operating darkroom in the nation.</p>
<p>Today, thanks to donations from Bennett granddaughter Jean Dyer Reese
and her husband, Oliver, it's part of the H.H. Bennett Studio and
History Center, operated by the Wisconsin Historical Society.</p>
<p>The museum is a good first stop for tourists, some of whom have no idea
that there are dells in Wisconsin Dells, which was called Kilbourn City
until 1931, when tourism-minded civic leaders renamed the village.</p>
<p>&quot;When people come to the Dells, you would think it would be the first
thing they want to see, but that's not why they come,&quot; Kurtz says.
&quot;When they come downtown, it's for the T-shirts and ice cream.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The beautifully designed little museum is Wisconsin's own loving
portrait of the old Dells and the man who made the tourists come
running.</p>
<p>There's a cutout of Bennett's famous 1888 photo of his 17-year-old son,
Ashley, jumping the 5½-foot chasm to the top of Standing Rock. The first
example of stop-action photography, it made audiences at his
magic-lantern shows gasp.</p>
<p>To get the photo, Bennett invented a rubber band-operated shutter he
called &quot;the Snapper,&quot; and Ashley had to make the jump 18 times before
his father captured the image he wanted.</p>
<p>The museum has marked off the distance on carpet for visitors who want
to try it, and it's not that easy. Today, dogs make the jump there and
back for passengers on Upper Dells boat tours.</p>
<p>He also made many portraits of the local Winnebago, whose dance
ceremonials, along with boat excursions, were the only tourist
attractions in the Dells for many years.</p>
<p>He tried to learn their language, keeping notebooks of phonetic
Winnebago words and their English meanings, and recorded their legends.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_river_cliffs.jpg" alt="Cliff divers in Wisconsin Dells." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>According to the Winnebago, who in 1994 reclaimed their original name,
Ho-Chunk, the Dells were formed by an enormous serpent who slithered
toward the sea, cutting a groove for the river bed with its scaly body.</p>
<p>At the Dells, the serpent squeezed through a crack in the rock, they thought, scraping
it into the formations seen today.</p>
<p>Racks of stereoscope views show the Dells in vivid 3-D, before the 1909
Kilbourn Dam divided the Upper and Lower Dells and raised the river 17
feet, obliterating sand beaches and altering views of the formations.</p>
<p>Bennett opposed the dam: &quot;With me, every rock that is to be hidden is a
sacrilege of what the good God has done in carving them into beautiful
shapes.&quot;</p>
<p>Because of Bennett and his heirs, however, much of the old Dells have
been preserved. Not only do the photos show the old river, but Bennett's
daughter Nellie and her husband, George Crandall, acquired and
preserved 1,200 acres along the Upper Dells, which the family later
donated.</p>
<p>&quot;Had they not done that, it would've been condos all the way to
Mauston,&quot; Kurtz said. &quot;And they were not wealthy people; they were just
very environmentally conscious.&quot;</p>
<p>By the end of the 20th century, tourists were starting to bring their
own cameras, buying more souvenirs at the Bennett studio than photos.</p>
<p>The studio museum also sells souvenirs; that's usually what catches the
eyes of passing tourists and lures them inside the 1875 storefront,
wedged between a trading post and an old-time portrait studio.</p>
<p>Once inside, they'll have a chance to see an era preserved only in
Bennett's photographs.</p>
<p>They're all that's left of the old Dells, and after all, said John Muir,
a contemporary of Bennett's who grew up in the next county, &quot;no human
eye will ever describe them.&quot;</p>
