<h2>Leinenkugel's brewery, the Old Abe bike trail and the Chippewa River draw tourists to this Wisconsin town.</h2>

<p>In Chippewa Falls, people owe a debt to two kinds of folks: the bubbas
and the geeks.</p>
<p>The first came to harvest the lumber and stayed to drink the beer, or so
claims the brewery: &quot;It takes a special beer to attract 2,500 men to a
town with no women,&quot; says Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing, founded in 1867
and now the oldest business in town.</p>
<p>Then came the guys with slide rules. Seymour Cray, the son of the city
engineer, spent his childhood in Chippewa Falls tinkering with radios,
then went off to war and college.</p>
<p>Cray co-founded Control Data in the Twin Cities but in 1962 returned to
Chippewa Falls, where he opened a lab, putting the locals to work on the
world's first supercomputer.</p>
<p>Most of Cray Research moved in 1989 to Colorado, where Seymour Cray died
after a 1996 car accident.</p>
<p>The Leinenkugels still run the brewery but sold it in 1988 to Miller,
which merged with South African Breweries in 2002 to become the global
corporation SABMiller, now part of InBev, the world's largest brewing
company.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But Chippewa Falls claims them both. A complete collection of Cray's
groundbreaking computers is enshrined at its Museum of Industry &amp;
Technology. And Leinenkugel is more popular than ever, with a fun Leinie
Lodge and a huge fan club.</p>
<p>Today, this western Wisconsin town happily pays tribute to the past.</p>
<p>The pure water of Chippewa Springs still is bottled and sent around the
country, as it has been since early settler and Congressman Thaddeus
Pound, grandfather of poet Ezra Pound, decided it had restored his
health.</p>
<p>Sokup's Market, established in 1891, still is owned by Sokups, who
still deliver groceries. Olson's still is making its Homaid ice cream
daily, as it has since 1923.</p>
<p>The town was among the first to fix up its ornate turn-of-the-century
buildings, placing its commercial district on the National Register of
Historic Places.</p>
<p>Up on the bluff, it turned a 1907 neoclassical Catholic high school into
the gleaming Heyde Center for the Arts.</p>
<p>Nationally, people have noticed. In 1996, the National Trust for
Historic Preservation gave it one of its first Great American Main
Street awards.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chippewa_falls_olsons.jpg" alt="Olson's ice cream in Chippewa Falls." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Olson's on Bridge Street has been making Homaid ice cream since 1923.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In 2000, the National Trust made it one of its first Dozen Distinctive
Destinations.</p>
<p>Hollywood thinks Chippewa Falls is pretty cute, too, making it the
hometown of Annie Hall in the 1977 Woody Allen movie and of Jack Dawson
in 1997's &quot;Titanic.&quot;</p>
<p>Visitors may find it a little sleepy. At Foreign 5 gift shop on Bridge
Street, flip through the pages of &quot;It's a Small Town If . . .&quot; and
you'll recognize Chippewa Falls: &quot;If Sunday is what Sunday was
(closed)&quot; and &quot;If visitors are always asking, 'What's there to do
around here, anyhow?' &quot;</p>
<p>Quite a lot-if you know where to go. One September, my husband and I
went there to ride on the 20-mile Old Abe State Trail.</p>
<p>From the point at which the Chippewa River balloons into Lake Wissota,
we rode the paved trail north, passing a llama farm and yellowing
cornfields on our way to Jim Falls, where we saw a 10½-foot statue of a
bald eagle.</p>
<p>Old Abe was only a few months old when he was traded by an Ojibwe man to
a Jim Falls farmer, who sold him to Company C of the Eighth Wisconsin as
it was preparing to leave for the Civil War.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Old Abe served as mascot in 42 battles and after the war received his
own room and caretaker at the State Capitol. He was in demand at
national events; one of his last appearances before his 1881 death was
alongside former President U.S. Grant.</p>
<p>From Jim Falls, the trail travels between river and slough, where we
spotted a great blue heron; on a wooden bridge, two couples were
grilling hamburgers and fishing for smallmouth bass.</p>
<p>We passed the 1906 steel truss bridge at Cobban and soon saw the
175-foot pulpwood stacker above Mill Yard Park in Cornell, whose
founder, Ezra Cornell, plumbed its natural resources to endow Cornell
University in New York.</p>
<p>Then we rode back to Lake Wissota. If we'd had a canoe, we could have
paddled to our room at the Pleasant View B&amp;B, a contemporary inn nearby.</p>
<p>Our room had a view of the lake and sliding glass doors that opened onto
a deck; in the morning, our breakfast was delivered on a tray, which we
ate on the deck.</p>
<p>Then we went hiking at the Chippewa Moraine Interpretive Center, 15
miles west of Cornell, and when we returned, we drove over to see the
state park on Lake Wissota, created by and named for the
Wisconsin-Minnesota Power and Light Company.</p>
<p>After its dam was completed, Chippewa Falls called itself &quot;The Power
City.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chippewa_falls_parade_beer_wagon.jpg" alt="Leinenkugel's beer wagon goes down Bridge Street during Pure" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Days parade.

<p>By the time we finally got downtown, it was already 4 p.m. on a
Saturday. The town was pretty much rolled up except for Olson's, where
we sampled the Homaid pistachio nut and tiramisu ice creams, and
old-fashioned Irvine Park, where we looked at the bison and elk behind
chain-link fencing.</p>
<p>It was busier the next time we visited, in August for Pure Water Days.
At Sokup's, we bought a still-warm tripleberry pie from Connell's
Orchard.</p>
<p>At the Museum of Industry &amp; Technology, Teresa Simpson showed us Seymour
Cray's first, refrigerator-sized computer, made in 1960 with thousands
of rejected Tandy transistors that he fixed himself.</p>
<p>The legendary genius did all his math on a slide rule, Simpson said, and
his designs with a No. 3 Ticonderoga pencil and graph paper.</p>
<p>&quot;It was pretty crazy, but it had to start somewhere,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>We missed the last tour of Leinenkugel Brewery, which didn't stop the
nice folks at Leinie Lodge from pouring me a free glass of Sunset Wheat
at the crowded bar. The northwoods-style lodge now is the biggest
visitor draw in the Chippewa Valley, which includes Eau Claire and
Menomonie.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/i/biking_chippewa_falls.jpg" alt="A bicyclist pedals on the Old Abe State Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It turns out people really like to drink free beer, sit chatting in
leather furniture around a stone fireplace and shop for Leinie-themed
soaps, salamis, sweatshirts, Christmas ornaments and picture frames.</p>
<p>Across Jefferson Avenue, we drove into Irvine Park to see the trompe
l'oeil facade for the concrete bear den, created during the annual
Brush Bash, a three-day workfest by traditional sign-painters led by
local artist Kurt Gaber.</p>
<p>Downtown, on both sides of narrow Harmony Park, they've also painted a
mural that follows Chippewa Falls history from the Ojibwe and the
logging era to Leinenkugel, Mason Shoes and Seymour Cray.</p>
<p>Chippewa Falls isn't exactly cutting edge, but it's become expert at
recognizing the value of the old as well as the new.</p>
<p>Few thought the abandoned 1907 school that's now the Heyde Center could
be salvaged, said director Deb Johnson; the roof was falling in and it
was full of pigeon poop.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But residents did it anyway, restoring the neoclassical hilltop building
with 100,000 hours of volunteer labor.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just incredible what people have done,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;It's
just beautiful. People walk in and you hear them go, 'Oh, man.' &quot;</p>
<p>Johnson herself grew up in the area but moved to Honduras, returning to
take the Chippewa Valley Cultural Association job.</p>
<p>&quot;It was so nice coming back,&quot; she said. &quot;There's such a sense of
community, and the friendliness of the people, I'd just kind of forgot
about it.&quot;</p>
<p>Around Chippewa Falls, long memories have served the town well.</p>
