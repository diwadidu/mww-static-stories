<h2>A riverside estate provides a window into Victorian high society.</h2>

<p>He was young and dashing, the son of Wisconsin's first millionaire, an
Indian trader who became a country gentleman.</p>
<p>She was a beautiful debutante, daughter of a Fort Snelling general who
was Custer's commander in South Dakota.</p>
<p>The pair loved art, horses and books; after they met in St. Paul and
married, they honeymooned in Europe, where they commissioned an artist
to cast their handsome faces in bronze.</p>
<p>H. Louis and Nina Sturgis Dousman were frontier nobility, the Kennedys
of Prairie du Chien, where their home, Villa Louis, was a kind of
Camelot on the river.</p>
<p>Today, the estate preserves the history of the family and also of
Prairie du Chien, a town that three nations considered the center of
trade on the Upper Mississippi and the site of Wisconsin's only War of
1812 battle.</p>
<p>This beautiful plain near the mouth of the Wisconsin River was first
inhabited by prehistoric Indians and then by Winnebago, Sauk and
Mesquakie Indians, one of whom had a name that translates as &quot;dog,&quot;
or <em>chien</em> in French.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It was claimed for France by Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet
in 1673, and the fur trade flourished there for the next 160 years,
lastly under the banner of John Jacob Astor.</p>
<p>It was one of Astor's clerks who really pounced on the possibilities of
the area after his arrival in 1826.</p>
<p>Hercules Dousman put fur-trade profits into steamboats, railroads,
sawmills and land, amassing a fortune that he used to build a mansion on
an ancient ceremonial mound left on St. Feriole Island.</p>
<p>It also was the site of old Fort Crawford, formerly Fort McKay, formerly
Fort Shelby before the British took it in 1814.</p>
<p>The elder Dousman died in 1868, and his wife and son razed the house and
built a cream-brick Italianate manse. This is what visitors see today,
in a pastoral setting of duck ponds, weeping willows and an artesian
fountain.</p>
<p>When we were there, our cosumed guide painted an intricate portrait of
Victorian society as reflected through the Dousmans. We saw the bronze
busts of Louis and Nina and oil paintings of their young children.</p>
<p>We saw their billiards table and photos of the teen-agers and their
friends gathered around it. We saw the photo album of the grown-up
Violet opened to the Sphinx in the Valley of Pharaohs, where she
traveled.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/r/prairie_du_chien_villa_louis.jpg" alt="Villa Louis in Prairie du Chien." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Villa Louis was built with the proceeds of Wisconsin's first
million-dollar fortune.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We saw, in fact, a houseful of possessions that are nearly all those of
the Dousmans, reassembled in the 1930s by Violet and her sister
Virginia, making Villa Louis (pronounced Lou-EE)
one of the most
authentically furnished Victorian houses in the nation.</p>
<p>To restore it, specialists were brought in from around the country; one
re-created a popular Victorian painting technique that made lead pipes
look like wood, and another came to analyze paint colors.</p>
<p>In England, William Morris archives were combed for the original
wallpaper patterns, which were then custom-ordered along with new
carpets.</p>
<p>In the parlor, original chairs were reupholstered with $300-per-yard
red silk-satin fabric.</p>
<p>In the guest room, a settee, armchair and two side chairs, half of a
suite for which Hercules Dousman paid $425 in the 1850s, got a $20,000
makeover with carefully reproduced $500-per-yard emerald-green silk
brocatelle overlaid with cream linen.</p>
<p>But even more memorable than the gleaming fabrics and gilt mirrors are
the reflected personalities of long-ago owners. Married in 1873 at the
Cathedral of St. Paul, Louis and Nina soon had five children, who came
of age alongside the Mississippi on the sprawling grounds of Villa
Louis.</p>
<p>The house was properly elegant; Nina was acutely aware of her social
standing. But enlarged photographs sprinkled around the house show a
family that lived with gusto.</p>
<p>There's Violet playing pool, beating a man who was trying to court her.
There are the children putting on a circus in the attic and, as young
adults, playing charades with their friends on the veranda.</p>
<p>But life for the Dousmans included misfortune. The middle child, Nina,
died at 14 when she refueled a hairstyling lamp while it was still lit.
Louis died of appendicitis at age 37; his widow remarried but soon
divorced, and the daughter from that match died of pneumonia at age 3.</p>
<p>But the other children grew up healthy, married and thrived; in 1934,
the family transferred the estate to the city, and Violet and Virginia
reassembled the old family possessions to furnish it.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a lot more enjoyable than going to Hyde Park or the Vanderbilt
house, because everything comes from here,&quot; said Kerry Franks of
Arcadia, Wis., while taking a tour of Villa Louis. &quot;The others are a
lot more opulent, but if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all.&quot;</p>
<p>Prairie du Chien itself has not fared as well as the house. Its center
moved across the slough after repeated flooding, and now the focus of
this second-oldest town in Wisconsin, after Green Bay, is Wisconsin 35,
which slices it in two.</p>

<p>St. Feriole Island now is where the city celebrates, at the annual
re-enactments of Wisconsin's only 1812 battle, the Prairie Dog Blues
Festival and the Prairie Villa Rendezvous, a large encampment of fur
trade-era re-enactors.</p>
<p>It's also the site of the Mississippi River Sculpture Garden, where a
bronze figure of Black Hawk marks the Sauk leader's surrender to future
president Col. Zachary Taylor at Fort Crawford in 1832.</p>
<p>The garden plans to portray 26 historical figures, including Taylor and
Lt. Jefferson Davis, who escorted Black Hawk to St. Louis.</p>
<p>History is everywhere. From town, most tourists head south for Wyalusing
State Park, if only to see the river valley from the 500-foot bluffs.</p>
<p>It's a splendid panorama that includes the islands and sloughs around
the mouth of the Wisconsin River, where Marquette and Joliet first saw
the Mississippi in 1673.</p>
<p>To the north at the foot of the Iowa bluffs, there's the town of
Marquette, named for the French priest.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Across the river, there's the 500-foot bluff that Lt. Zebulon Pike
chose for a fort on his 1805 expedition up the Mississippi. Today, it's
Iowa's Pikes Peak State Park; the young lieutenant's superiors
scrapped his site in favor of the Prairie du Chien's flats.</p>
<p>Ancient Indians already had chosen these bluffs. They left effigy mounds
along Wyalusing's Sentinel Ridge and also on the bluffs north of
Marquette, at what is now Effigy Mounds National Monument.</p>
<p>This dramatic landscape has exerted a magnetic pull on anyone who's
laid eyes on it. From here, it's easy to see why.</p>
