<h2>In a southeastern Minnesota village, nostalgia is the currency of the present.</h2>

In Mantorville, the Hubbell House has been serving diners since 1857.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Back in Minnesota�s early days, the town of Mantorville was a contender.</p>
<p>In the 1850s, it was a stagecoach stop on the route from the Mississippi to the western plains. It sat in a green little valley on a branch of the Zumbro River, and the local limestone was in demand all over southern Minnesota.</p>
<p>But the railroad and main highways bypassed Mantorville, and it was eclipsed by such neighboring towns as Rochester, where the brothers Mayo were founding a clinic.</p>
<p>Yet history has a way of turning back on itself. Today, people from those bigger towns are happy to forsake their split-levels and office buildings for a little trip back in time.</p>
<p>They wander Mantorville�s 12 blocks of limestone and clapboard buildings, all of them on the National Register, and dine under milk-glass sconces at the atmospheric 1854 Hubbell House.</p>
<p>They take in one of the melodramas performed at the 1918 Opera House and browse through the antiques shops that flank it.</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>Civic leaders gilded the lily in the 1970s by installing wooden boardwalks all over town. The planks made Mantorville look like a movie set and were inscribed with the names of the people who had ``bought�� them for $1. Visitors loved it, especially when they spied the name of a celebrity. But three years ago, the rustic but rough-hewn planks had to be ripped up.</p>
<p>``It was kind of a shame; people wandered all over town reading those boards,�� says Arlene Draeger, office manager of the Hubbell House. ``But there were too many lawsuits. I know the Hubbell House itself had to buy one lady a pair of new shoes after she broke off her heel on them.��</p>
<p>Bits of boardwalk still can be found here and there. But even without it, Mantorville, pop. 874, is the darling of day-trippers and senior tour groups from all over the state. They can�t resist � this village along the banks of the Zumbro River is just too cute.</p>
<p>Geri Lampland, who operated a tea room in a Victorian gingerbread house until health problems forced her to sell it, discovered Mantorville after living in nearby Kasson for eight years.</p>
<p>``I came and thought, `Holy buckets! I didn�t know all of this stuff was here,� �� she told me when I visited last fall. ``There�s Paul�s; he�s got gorgeous antiques. There�s Pfeifer�s Eden B&amp;B, so beautiful, and such a nice couple, and the Chocolate Shoppe � I kid you not, the chocolates are wonderful, and they make them right there.��</p>
<p>Then her eyes widened, and she gripped my arm. ``Oh, and another place, Carl�s Cut Crystal. Oh, he�s good. And there�s a brewery down the road that makes really good beers... Oh, you�re getting me going now.��</p>
<p>The slogan of the Mantorville Brewing Co. is ``Brewed in the Shadow of History,�� and that�s the truth: Its ales and porters are made in a modern building on the edge of downtown, near the hillside ruins of the town�s first brewery. Mike Wheeler, one of a ``six-pack�� of local men who started the brewery in 1996, was doing chores there over his lunch break when I stopped by.</p>
<p>``This is our weekend hobby, but we�d love to have it be our full-time job,�� he said, filling a cup with Stagecoach Ale. ``We let people come in and watch on Saturday mornings. We have the one-glass tour, where you can stand around and sample, then we have the two-glass tour, and after three glasses, we give you a pair of boots and an apron and put you to work.��</p>
<p>Down the street, the Hubbell House displays an 1870 photo of the old limestone brewery, along with photos of most everything else around town; the restaurant does double duty as a museum.</p>
<p>As I ate my walleye pike � served with a whole array of side dishes, by waitresses in black-and-white uniforms � I had to restrain an urge to jump up and inspect the walls, especially one with a large mural of famous Minnesotans. Even the placemats were entertaining, with reproduced signatures of some of the Hubbell�s famous visitors � U.S. Grant, Horace Greeley, Ole Bull, Roy Rogers, Mickey Mantle.</p>
<p>As I finished dinner, the audience was starting to arrive for that evening�s performance of ``Trapped in a Villain�s Web, or, Weave Me a Loan,�� at the old opera house.</p>
<p>As the play started, the audience started performing too, using cardboard ``boo-horns�� to comment on the evil schemes of Fifi du Bayou and Beau Weevil. The heroine was sweet and adorable, the hero was true and strong, and Cole Porter songs and ragtime piano leavened the heavy dose of corn. Afterward, in a receiving line outside the theater, the actors shook hands and basked in praise.</p>
<p>The Mantorville Theatre Company has been performing the melodramas since 1973 and has a hoot every time, according to business manager Kris Knutson of Pine Island, who says her own favorite role was in ``A Night in the Nutt House�� as ``an insane sister with her hair on end and a spider in a jar for a pet.��</p>
<p>``It�s different from any other kind of theater,�� she says. ``Once people come, they return. It�s just a matter of coming the first time.��</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.mantorvilletourism.com/">Mantorville</a> / Melodrama on the Zumbro River</h3>
<p>Highbrow it's not. But the theater housed in the 1918 Opera House of Mantorville, Minn., is as endearing as an old quilt.</p>
<p>Since 1973, the <a href="http://www.mantorvillain.com/">Mantorville Theater Company</a>has been having a swell time putting on melodramas, some of them original, in this tiny village on the Zumbro River, 15 minutes west of Rochester.</p>
<p>Audiences are encouraged to boo the villains, who are always dastardly, and cheer the heroes, who are always true and strong.</p>
