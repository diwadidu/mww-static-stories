<h2>This sweet town in northwest Illinois is packed with history ... and mystery.</h2>

Historian Steven Repp was first to lead ghost tours in Galena.

<p>In the northwest corner of Illinois, there's no more cheerful place
than Galena.</p>
<p>Today, it's known for its shops and giggling bands of women on a
girlfriend getaway. But in the 1850s, it was the busiest port between
St. Louis and St. Paul, and rows of elegant homes were built with
lead-mining fortunes.</p>
<p>Eventually, demand for lead waned, and the river connecting Galena to
the Mississippi filled with silt. The town went into a deep sleep until
the 1960s, by which point it had become a virtual museum.</p>
<p>Today, it's a vacation destination, with all kinds of tours on offer:
trolley tours, vineyard tours, scooter tours . . . and ghost tours.
Several, in fact.</p>
<p>&quot;Galena is a very nice place,&quot; says historian Steve Repp, who was
first to lead All About a Ghost tours downtown. &quot;But there's a certain
mystery to it.&quot;</p>
<p>Repp starts his tours by asking if people are &quot;ready to cross over to
the other side,&quot; but mostly, he talks about the past.</p>
<p>He points to the 1855 DeSoto House, where Abraham Lincoln spoke in 1856
from a balcony, still draped in red, white and blue bunting, and from
which Ulysses S. Grant ran his successful 1868 presidential campaign.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He points to the 1856 building where Grant worked as a clerk in his
brother's leather shop.</p>
<p>&quot;Galena looks much as it did then,&quot; he said. &quot;Put in some dirt and
wooden boardwalks, and you're there.&quot;</p>
<p>The first published account of a ghost was in 1845, when two residents
reported a very tall, ghostly figure beckoning on their wall and became
convinced it was a veteran of the War of 1812. There were phantoms
reported in mines, on a bridge, in boarding houses.</p>
<p>From Main Street, Repp leads his guests to the 1875 Turner Hall, used as
a theater. In the balcony, set builders have reported seeing the ghostly
figure of an older man with a goatee, rolled-up sleeves and laser-like
eyes; a local pastor heard a garbled voice coming from the balcony.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/a/galena_ghost_tour2.jpg" alt="A ghost tour group in Galena." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The ghost is said to be Charles Scheerer, the hall's longtime business
manager and Galena's mayor when he suddenly died in the hall in 1910.</p>
<p>In the 1867 Farmers' Guest House, once a hotel, guests have detected
the aroma of pipe tobacco. At Vinny Vanucchi's restaurant, workers have
felt taps on the shoulder, heard whispered names and seen a mist-like
figure.</p>
<p>At the restaurant One Eleven Main, once a mortuary, employees have
reported a piano moving on its own and a woman in a white dress.</p>
<p>Repp brings his tours into the restaurant to see a photo, taken by a
chef, that shows three swooping, wraith-like figures. He says ghost
sightings seem to follow remodeling projects.</p>
<p>&quot;When people go into these old buildings and start to disrupt things,
I've noticed certain unusual things occur,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes you
wonder.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of the tour I was on, Repp gathered the group and asked if
any of us had had experience with ghosts.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been doing this for five years and I've heard a thousand
stories,&quot; he said. &quot;If you say three-quarters of them were made up
to dupe me, that still leaves a quarter.&quot;</p>
<p>One woman had smelled cigar smoke from her recently deceased
grandfather.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Another told of a little girl ghost who once tugged on her skirt and,
she believes, placed a piece of lost jewelry on a counter for her after
she'd cleaned the entire house searching for it.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this little ghost had been around for a while; I could kind of
see her out of the corner of my eye,&quot; she said. &quot;I don't
necessarily believe in ghosts, but it happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Repp says that sometimes only a couple of people on the tour tell of
encounters with ghosts, and sometimes nearly everyone does. He's never
had an encounter himself.</p>
<p>&quot;The other day, 15 people told stories of things that had happened, if
not to them, to their mothers or sisters or brothers; it was
unbelievable,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes you wonder.&quot;</p>
