<h2>Along the North Shore, early-winter winds evoke visions of shipwrecks.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/split_rock_close_up.jpg" alt="Split Rock Lighthouse on Minnesota's North Shore." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Minnesota's North Shore, Split Rock Lighthouse was built in response
to storms in 1905.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In November 1905, the people of Minnesota saw Lake Superior at its most
malevolent.</p>
<p>As dozens of ships left Duluth-Superior Harbor in the calm after a
violent storm, an even worse storm hit, with blinding snow and winds of
more than 60 mph.</p>
<p>The 4,840-ton steel steamer Mataafa turned back and, just as it was
about to slip into the harbor entry, was lifted by a giant wave, upended
and smashed into first one concrete pierhead, then the other.</p>
<p>Another wave whirled the 430-foot boat around and grounded it 600 feet
off the beach, where mountainous waves cleaved its stern from its bow.</p>
<p>Ten thousand Duluthians, many of whom had watched two other boats
founder hours earlier, kept vigil by the light of bonfires as the storm
blew. On the Mataafa, 15 crewmen kept warm by a fire built in the
captain's bathtub.</p>
<p>They were rescued the next day, but nine were lost — including four
men who had lashed themselves to masts and frozen.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;To watch these men die was really hard on the citizens of Duluth,&quot;
says Scott Anfinson of the Minnesota Historic Preservation Office, who
has documented Minnesota shipwrecks. &quot;This made people aware of how
dangerous the lake was.&quot;</p>
<p>The 1905 storm, which became known as the <a href="https://www.lakesuperior.com/the-lake/maritime/the-mataafa-blow-stormy-horror-of-1905/">Mataafa
Blow</a>, damaged 29 ships on Lake Superior. The lake has been called the most
dangerous body of water in the world, an inland teakettle in which any
tempest can be deadly.</p>
<p>When a cold Canadian nor'wester hits the warmer lake, it can gather
strength across 200 miles of open water and whip toward Michigan's
Whitefish Bay with waves that, swirling around the narrowing lake, can
twist a boat in two.</p>
<p>Winds that blow from the east have less time to build. But when they
hit, they hit rock — and heaven help any boat caught in between.</p>
<p>&quot;We all love the rugged beauty of the North Shore,&quot; Anfinson says. &quot;But
it doesn't have any beaches, which is unfortunate for any ship being
dragged against it.&quot;</p>
<p>Few signs remain of North Shore shipwrecks, at least above the water —
sport divers often visit the wrecks that remain, such as the Madeira,
within sight of Split Rock, and the Samuel P. Ely, a schooner-barge that
was driven into Two Harbors' Agate Bay in 1896.</p>
<p>But the stories are vivid even to those who look on from the shore. Late
one October, three friends and I took a shipwreck tour of the North
Shore, stopping first at the Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center on
Duluth's Canal Park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/o/gold_rock_point.jpg" alt="View of Gold Rock Point in Lake Superior" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In November 1905, eight crewman from the Madeira pulled themselves up
Gold Rock as their barge sank beneath them.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We found Thom Holden manning the desk and asked him to point out where
the Mataafa foundered and also the site of the Thomas Wilson, a
whaleboat rammed by a wooden steamer in 1902 and sunk not far from the
canal entry, where oceangoing vessels often wait their turn at the grain
docks.</p>
<p>But then, inevitably, we asked about the Edmund Fitzgerald.</p>
<p>The Fitzgerald, the fabled ore boat that vanished in a 1975 storm, is
not a Minnesota wreck. It left from Wisconsin, after picking up taconite
in Superior, and went down off the Michigan coast near the international
border. Canada has jurisdiction over the wreck, and the captain and much
of the crew were from Ohio.</p>
<p>But the Fitz was a familiar sight in the Twin Ports, as is the Arthur M.
Anderson, whose radio correspondence with the Fitz provided the only
clues to its disappearance.</p>
<p>The Fitzgerald is discussed in Duluth every year at the Gales of
November conference, and every Nov. 10 at Split Rock Lighthouse, the
beacon is lighted and the names of the 29 dead sailors read.</p>
<p>So we went over the various theories: The Fitz hit a shoal. It had
design flaws. Its steel and welds were overstressed from years as a
workhorse. It was hit by the Three Sisters — a Lake Superior
phenomenon in which two rogue waves hit, followed by a third, massive
wave that overwhelms the boat as it struggles to recover.</p>
<p>Holden's conclusion: All of the above.</p>
<p>&quot;With all Lake Superior shipwrecks, it's a series of events,&quot; he said.
&quot;But with this one, it was series after series after series of things.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Does Holden ever get tired of speculating about the Fitz? &quot;No, not
really,&quot; he replied with a smile. &quot;As you probably can tell.&quot;</p>
<p>Over his head, a video monitor announced that afternoon's arrival of the
Arthur M. Anderson. We walked to the back of the museum and gazed at a
model of the Fitz, torn, twisted and scattered on a bed of sand.</p>
<p>The dramatic stories made our next stop, Knife River, an anticlimax.
Amid fog in June 1904, the captain of the Niagara ran his tug onto Knife
Island, tricked by &quot;compass devils,&quot; or minerals, that drew the compass
needle eastward toward shore.</p>
<p>Just before the boat disintegrated in the pounding surf, the tug Edna G.
rescued its 13 occupants.</p>
<p>Farther out, the Onoko lies upside-down, the victim of sudden hull
failure in 1914; its crew rowed themselves to safety.</p>
<p>In Two Harbors, we stopped to see the Edna G., the St. Bernard of the
North Shore. Retired in 1981 after 85 years of service, she was on the scene at hundreds of mishaps — but not on Oct. 29, 1896, when a gale blew the wooden schooner Ely into
Agate Bay.</p>
<p>Its wreck now lies on the inside of the west breakwall, next to the ore
docks.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/i/fitzgerald.jpg" alt="The Edmund Fitzgerald." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Edmund Fitzgerald was called "Queen of the Lakes" when it was
launched in 1958.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;It's seldom safe in this area,&quot; said Sheila Fallon, a Lake County
Historical Society volunteer who was working at the Lighthouse B&amp;B, in
the red-brick 1891 building that's the last working lighthouse on the
North Shore. &quot;Last weekend, the weather changed six times in one day.&quot;</p>
<p>We walked up the beacon tower, then toured the pilothouse of the
Frontenac, pushed onto a Silver Bay reef by a 1979 squall and eventually
scrapped.</p>
<p>It was the same spot that in May 1905 claimed the Hesper,
which was towing the Ely in the 1896 gale but escaped damage.</p>
<p>Heading up the shore, we passed through the Lafayette tunnel, named for
the steel steamer that, in November 1905, was pulverized against the
nearby cliff, now called Lafayette Bluff.</p>
<p>In the same storm, winds hurled the steamer Edenborn into the mouth of
the Split Rock River and cracked it in the middle.</p>
<p>The Edenborn's steel barge, the Madeira, was not so fortunate. Just
yards from a pebble cove, winds hammered the Madeira against the base of
Gold Rock.</p>
<p>It was starting to break up when seaman Fred Benson jumped onto the
sheer face of the cliff and scrambled to the top with a coil of rope.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Weighting it with a rock, he threw it back to the sinking boat, from
which eight of the nine crewmen were able to climb to safety.</p>
<p>Today, Gold Rock is part of Split Rock State Park, and a path leads to
the cove that separates it from the lighthouse. From there, we stared
over at Gold Rock, whose face, covered with patches of orange lichen,
flares outward as it rises from the water.</p>
<p>&quot;How did that first guy get up?&quot; Becky wondered. &quot;Think of his hands
— it'd be cold, there'd be ice. Now, that would make a movie.&quot;</p>
<p>From the cove, we followed a path through woods to the top of the rock,
where I lay on my stomach and gingerly looked over the edge.</p>
<p>There, just to the right at the foot of the cliff, were the dark
outlines of the Madeira, the base of its bow just 40 feet down and often
visited by divers.</p>
<p>In the visitors center of the lighthouse, built in 1909 after intense
lobbying by ship owners, we saw an underwater video of the wreck, and a
film about the construction of he lighthouse.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of improving their underpowered and uninsured boats, the
steel-company owners went to Washington and lobbied,&quot; a narrator
playing Split Rock's builder says.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_harbors_tugboat.jpg" alt="The Edna G. tugboat in Two Harbors." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Edna G. was the St. Bernard of Lake Superior's North Shore.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was not the beacon but the fog signals that proved most useful. The
picturesque, pale-yellow lighthouse became indispensable to tourists,
however, who flocked to it as soon as the North Shore highway was opened
in 1924.</p>
<p>The beacon was turned off in 1969 but the tourists kept coming, making
Split Rock the most-visited historic site in Minnesota despite its
five-month season.</p>
<p>&quot;They could've shut it down after World War II because of radar and
other developments,&quot; says former site manager Lee Radzak, who lived in
the middle keeper's house for many years. &quot;They did keep it open a good
10 years after they needed to, it was such a showplace for the Coast
Guard.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, it's the place to be for those who, on windswept days, want to
imagine the gales of November.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Shipwrecks and storm watching on Lake Superior</h3>
<p><em>Storm-watching:</em> Many lodgings offer specials in November; check web
sites. NOAA's National Weather Service makes <a href="https://www.weather.gov/marine/lsopen">Lake Superior
forecasts</a> that help estimate
what wave action will be during your stay.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service in Duluth lists <a href="https://www.lakesuperior.com/the-lake/natural-world/nine-major-lake-superior-storms/">nine of the biggest
storms</a>.</p>
<p><em>Podcasts:</em> Listen to podcasts about <a href="https://www.shipwreckpodcast.com/">Great Lakes
shipwrecks</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.lsmma.com">Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center</a> in
Duluth:</strong> Admission is free.</p>
<p>Shipping ends for the season when the Soo Locks in Sault Ste. Marie
close on Jan. 15, and resumes when the ice goes out in March.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.lsmma.com/">Gales of November</a> conference in Duluth:</strong>
It's usually the first weekend of November..</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mnhs.org/splitrock">Split Rock Lighthouse</a> Fitzgerald
commemoration:</strong> At 4:30 p.m. on Nov. 10,
names are read, the bell is rung and the <a href="https://www.mnhs.org/splitrock/activities/beacon-lighting">beacon is
lit</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgI8bta-7aw">YouTube video</a> shows
clips of the Fitzgerald, with the Gordon Lightfoot song as soundtrack.</p>
<p>The Coast Guard, National Transportation Safety Board and Lake Carriers
Association came to three different conclusions about why the Fitzgerald
sank.</p>
<p><em>Whitefish Point commemoration:</em> Every Nov. 10, the <a href="http://www.shipwreckmuseum.com/">Great Lakes
Shipwreck Museum</a> on Michigan's Upper
Peninsula, near the spot where the Fitzgerald sank, holds a service to
commemorate the loss of the ship and its crew of 29, ringing the ship's
salvaged bronze bell 29 times.</p>

<p><em>Information:</em> Julius Wolff Jr.'s &quot;Lake Superior Shipwrecks,&quot; for
which Thom Holden was contributing editor, is very informative, as is
the <a href="http://www.mnhs.org/places/nationalregister/shipwrecks/ship.html">Minnesota Historical Society shipwrecks
