<h2>In a Wisconsin college town, antiques shops and an ornate theater stand fast amid pizza shops.</h2>

The Mabel Tainter's interior shines with gold.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the western Wisconsin college town of Menomonie, shops and
restaurants come and go.</p>
<p>One building will stay for the ages: the Mabel Tainter Memorial Theater,
built of sandstone blocks backed by brick.</p>
<p>Lumber baron Andrew Tainter built it in memory of his daughter Mabel,
who died at age 19 of a burst appendix. With two renovations, the town
has polished its gloriously golden interior, fit for a Moorish princess.</p>
<p>Concerts, plays and ballets are held year-round in this Faberge egg of a
theater, home of the Menomonie Theater Guild.</p>
<p>The town's other landmark, the 1897 clock tower of Bowman Hall, also
was endowed by a lumber fortune. In the 1880s, Knapp, Stout &amp; Co. was
the largest white-pine lumber firm in the world, and Menomonie grew
along the shores of its big mill pond.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Henry Stout's son James founded the vocational institute that became
the nucleus for the University of Wisconsin-Stout. Today, it has more
than 9,000 students, many of whom study industrial technology, one of
Stout's pet interests.</p>
<p>You can tell Menomonie is a college town because of its tattoo parlor
and many pubs and pizza shops. But scattered around the feet of the
Mabel are an unusually large number of interesting antiques shops.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been trying to promote Menomonie as an antiques
destination,&quot; says Lynn Pfiffner of the Estate Emporium, just across
the street from the Mabel.</p>
<p>Two college girls were looking through her store, a collection of
cultural curiosities that included vintage clothes and a wooden
Norwegian tray with painted folk-art figures.</p>
<p>&quot;I like selling to students,&quot; Pfiffner said. &quot;They like to come
here, especially the ones studying art and fashion design.&quot;</p>
<p>On the same block, The Store benefits Refuge Farms Horse Rescue and
Sanctuary. It features furniture, including a two-tone art-deco desk set
on curving columns instead of legs.</p>

Lucette's beer cans feature their namesake, Paul Bunyan's sweetheart.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Town and Country Antiques shows the collections of dealers and has two
levels. Among the finds there: a clown costume complete with wig, shoes
and makeup, and a large, deep-red silk rug.</p>
<p>At the east end of the small downtown, Joan Navarre presides over the
sunny Triangle Art &amp; Antiques, in a triangular 1906 building that once
housed a monument company.</p>
<p>There was a giant Roman-style frieze in her window and, on her counter,
a cigarette case with an etched map of the Indian subcontinent. Navarre
bought it in Edinburgh, and it's easy to imagine a British officer
carrying it back from the Raj.</p>
<p>&quot;I get involved in the stories,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Navarre, an English professor at the university, also is fascinated by
Menomonie's history. Sometimes, she leads her students on downtown
walking tours that she titles &quot;The Power of Place.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I show them their neighborhood,&quot; she says. &quot;I get them to look up
and see the dates on the buildings. There's a separate story on the
second story.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Sure enough, set into the brick above the neighboring Silver Dollar bar
is a medallion that reads &quot;Pabst, Milwaukee.&quot;</p>
<p>Down the block, La Dee Dah sells funky clothes, jewelry and gifts. And
around the corner from the west end of Main Street is a store that makes
everyone smile: Marion's Legacy.</p>
<p>Legacy Chocolates was founded here before it moved to St. Paul. Now, the
shop sells not only the famous truffles, liquid-gold Sipping Chocolate
and Potion No. 9 chocolate sauce, but also coffee and pastries.</p>
<p>Menomonie's main tourist draw, the Red Cedar State Trail, is just
across the river. Stretching 14½ miles along the Red Cedar to the
Chippewa River, it's one of Wisconsin's loveliest and most serene
bicycle trails.</p>
<p>It's also the trail that's closest to a brewery: Lucette Brewing is
just a yard or two from the trailhead, brewing Ride Again pale ale and
The Farmer's Daughter spiced blond ale. Now, it also serves wood-fired
pizza.</p>

Triangle Art & Antiques includes an eclectic mix of items, many brought
from England and Scotland.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The brewery is named for the mythical sweetheart of the mythical Paul
Bunyan, in tribute to Menomonie's logging era.</p>
<p>There are no longer log rafts floating down the Red Cedar, and Lake
Menomin no longer is a mill pond. But the legacies of the lumber barons
haven't been forgotten.</p>
