<h2>Prowling antiques shops around Lindstrom, visitors find a beloved heritage.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/i/lindstrom_statue.jpg" alt="Statue of Karl Oskar and Kristina." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Lindstrom, a stoic Karl Oskar looks forward, and homesick Kristina
looks back.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Walking around Lindström, it's not hard to guess where the area's
first settlers came from.</p>
<p>If the multitude of umlauts don't give it away, the herds of Dala
horses and straw goats will. Factor in the giant white coffee pot in the
sky, and you can be pretty sure this is Swedish country.</p>
<p>In the 1850s, poor Swedes came pouring into the lakes country west of
Taylors Falls. It wasn't the best farmland, but it was cheap, and it
looked like Sweden-lots of water, lots of trees and, unfortunately,
lots of rocks.</p>
<p>Still, it seemed like heaven to the peasants, and the letters they sent
home brought more Swedes.</p>
<p>Before long, Chisago County had the highest concentration of rural
Swedes outside Sweden.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They became American, but after a century they retained so much of the
old language and customs that Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg came there
in 1948 to research his wildly popular &quot;Emigrants&quot; novels.</p>
<p>His 19th-century characters, Karl Oskar and Kristina, seemed so real to
modern Swedes that they're still traveling to Minnesota to see where
the fictional couple lived and died.</p>
<p>Until the '60s, Swedish still could be heard on the streets. Today, the
Twin Cities is lapping at the edges of the old communities, and hundreds
of houses are being built for exurbanites who don't know lefse from a
lima bean.</p>
<p>But the towns haven't forgotten their heritage, and they're making
sure no one else does, either.</p>
<p>On the U.S. 8 corridor, or Vilhelm Moberg Commemorative Trail, the signs
help. In Chisago City, they announce that the town is the sister city to
Algutsboda, Sweden, Moberg's hometown.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/i/lindstrom_watertower.jpg" alt="The watertower in Londstrom, MN" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Next comes a sign bidding welcome, or Välkommen, to Lindström, sister
city of Tingsryd.</p>
<p>There's another Välkommen painted onto the old water tower, converted
in 1992 to a coffeepot that steams for special occasions, and Swedish
translations of businesses hang over sidewalks.</p>
<p>Obviously, these are not just any old towns on the prairie. Still, most
people hurry through on their way to Taylors Falls and better-known
points beyond.</p>
<p>Each town is spiked with interesting shops, and one November, I went
antiques-hunting there with some friends.</p>
<p>Of the four Swedish communities along U.S. 8, <em>Chisago City</em> was our
first stop.</p>
<p>Walking into Chisago Antiques, the first thing we saw was a turn-of-the
century portrait of the Swedish royal family that included three present
and future kings, from Oscar II to Gustaf Adolf, grandfather of the
current king.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It was propped next to a rustic table and chairs, sponged and stenciled
with a prayer and names from a smörgåsbord: fisk, fågel, vilt, sallader,
bröd.</p>
<p>Down the street, we browsed in the Glyer Block Building and bought some
sticky rolls from a bakery before going on to <em>Lindström</em> .</p>
<p>It's the largest town and the heart of the Swedish community. Walking
down the street, we got a Swedish lesson from the oval signs hanging
over businesses: Antikviteter; antiques; Böcker, books; Kaffee Hus,
coffeehouse.</p>
<p>At the bakery, we bought bags of pepparkakor, the addictive ginger
cookies for which Swedes are known.</p>
<p>Nearby, a group of local antiques dealers who call themselves the Picket
Fence Gals was holding its monthly sale next to the historic Gustaf
Anderson House, built in 1879 by a Swedish immigrant who struck it rich
on the Montana gold fields.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/i/lindstrom_dancers.jpg" alt="Swedish folk dancers perform during Karl Oskar Days in Linds" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Crowds of shoppers had come to examine the wares, indoors and artfully
strewn around the porch and yard. In the collection, we found a Swedish
winnowing basket, wood skis and hand-painted red-leather clogs.</p>
<p>On the other end of town, we made a circuit through another antique shop
and found a 1937 illustrated map of Scandinavia and a rack of lovely,
turn-of-the-century baptismal gowns.</p>
<p>Then we headed for the area's largest antiques shop, past storefronts
adorned with Dala-horse cutouts and stenciled &quot;Välkommens&quot; encircled
with hearts and vines.</p>
<p>At Lindström Antique Mall, there was a whole shelf of white-enamel
Swedish coffeepots over the front desk, alongside little blue Dala pigs
and a straw goat bound with red ribbons.</p>
<p>In one booth, we found lovely Norwegian pewter and enamelware; in
another, wood pieces immigrants had brought over from Sweden.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We had lunch overlooking South Lindström Lake, on the spot where Daniel
Lindström built his cabin in 1854.</p>
<p>Then we pressed on to <em>Center City</em> , where the Swedes squeezed their
houses, shops and church between North Center and Pioneer lakes. They
may not have gotten rich, but they certainly lived with nice views.</p>
<p>The best view of all is from the cream-brick Chisago Lake Lutheran
Church, rebuilt on a hillside in 1882 but founded in 1854.</p>
<p>Locally, it's known as the historic Swedish church that hosts the
Sankta Lucia Festival of Lights in December, which honors a legendary
saint and kicks off the Christmas season.</p>
<p>Tourists know it as the church shown in the movie &quot;Grumpy Old Men.&quot;</p>
<p>From there, it's fun to climb the sidewalk that goes up the Summit
Avenue hill, a National Historic District of houses built between 1882
and 1910.</p>

<p>In the end, I left with nothing more than a bag of ginger cookies. I
could have gotten that at IKEA, but why would I want to? In Chisago
County, shopping is more than acquisition; it's a way to look into an
era that's not quite over.</p>
<p>&quot;There are so many new people in this community, and even with all the
Scandinavians here, it's hard to preserve the tradition we had in the
'50s and '60s, when people didn't move around so much,&quot; says Sherry
Stirling of the Chisago County Historical Society. &quot;But I think it's
still here, and people enjoy it.&quot;</p>

held at Chisago Lakes Lutheran Church in Center City, with a procession
led by a girl wearing a crown of candles, singing, dancing, goodies and
a character dressed as a tomte, a Swedish elf.</p>
<p>According to legend, Lucia was a wealthy young Sicilian woman whose
generosity to the poor incensed her fiancé; she refused to change, was
put to death by Roman soldiers and later was made a saint.</p>
<p>She became a household name in Sweden during a famine when, the legend
goes, a large ship came across Lake Vanern carrying a white-robed
maiden, her hands full of food for the famished people and wearing a
crown of candles to light the way.</p>
<p>Also in Center City, the Celebration of Lakes is held in late <em>January</em>
on North Center Lake, with hot-air balloons, dog-sled rides, helicopter
rides, ice-fishing contest, kids' games and snowmobile races.</p>
