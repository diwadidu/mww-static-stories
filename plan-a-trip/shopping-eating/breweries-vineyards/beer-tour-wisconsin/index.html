<p>Fat Squirrel. Spotted Cow. Lazy Mutt. Uff-da.</p>
<p>Uff-da? In Wisconsin, say that and you get a great glass of beer.
Anywhere else, and you get . . . a funny look.</p>
<p>Wisconsin may be full of cheeseheads. It may be a party state. But boy,
are they drinking a lot of good beer there.</p>
<p>Its days as the nation's beer capital are over — Schlitz, Pabst and
Heileman are gone — though you still can tour the old Miller plant in Milwaukee and
sample 10 American-style pilseners with different names.</p>
<p>Or you could go to New Glarus for a Belgian Red, a delectable cherry
beer that has won New Glarus Brewing Co. a boatload of prizes.</p>
<p>Or to Middleton for a Blonde Doppelbock from Capital Brewing.</p>
<p>In fact, you could try quite a lot of good beers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>That's what a girlfriend and I did on a tour of southern Wisconsin,
where the state's first brewery was built in 1835 — not in fledgling
Milwaukee, but in Mineral Point. That's where we stayed, at a brewery
that's also an inn, and shopped, at an old brewery that's now a
pottery studio.</p>
<p>We listened to music at a brewpub in Mount Horeb, and toured the
breweries in Middleton and New Glarus as well as one in Janesville.</p>
<p>It was Germans and Englishmen who brewed, but the Swiss also added to
the melting pot. In New Glarus, we bought Linzer bars and nut horns at
one of the best and oldest bakeries in the Midwest.</p>
<p>In Monroe, the capital of cheese country, we stopped at Wisconsin's
oldest cheese shop.</p>
<p>We didn't have the notorious Limburger-and-onion sandwich. But other
than that, we didn't shrink from new flavors.</p>
<p>&quot;Beer people and cheese people have a lot in common,&quot; says Deborah
Carey of New Glarus Brewing. &quot;If all you'd ever had was Velveeta, and
one day you had cheddar, you might be grossed out — or you might fall
in love with it.</p>
<p>&quot;But you'd definitely know there were different flavors out there.&quot;</p>

<h3>Ben Franklin and Frank Zappa</h3>
<p>Behind the 1892 walnut bar at Capital Brewing in Middleton, Tom Westfall
was quoting Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>&quot; 'Beer is living proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy,'
&quot; he said. He led us into the brew house, past fermenting tanks named
for Frank Zappa songs — Redunzel, Magdalena, Heavy Duty Judy — and
handed out kernels of malted barley to chew on; they tasted just like
Grape-Nuts cereal.</p>
<p>Then he let us smell the hops, which grow on vines.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone know what its closest relative is?&quot; he asked. &quot;Yep — a
slight little change in the genome and you're smoking wacky tobacky.
So you're either smoking dope or drinking beer.&quot;</p>
<p>Capital Brewing, he said, was started in 1984 by four servicemen who'd
been stationed in Germany and, once back in the States, yearned for good
beer. They're no longer involved, but their brewery has taken off.</p>
<p>&quot;We were rated No. 1 brewery in the U.S. by the Beverage Testing
Institute, and No. 4 in the world,&quot; Westfall said. &quot;Not bad for
Madison, Wis.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He poured a sample of Capital 1900, from an old Schlitz recipe. &quot;Give
'em a glass of this, and I guarantee they'll never go back to Bud or
Miller.&quot;</p>
<p>In the Bier Garten, picnickers were sitting at tables, with occasional
visits to the open-air bar, adorned with a mural of Alpine mountains.
There's a bandshell, too, for the musicians who play on Friday and
Saturday nights.</p>
<h3>Heading west</h3>
<p>We were tempted to hang out — a guitarist was noodling with some blues
tunes — but we headed west to <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/mount-horeb-wisconsin/">Mount
Horeb</a>,
a Norwegian town whose Main Street is lined with carved wood trolls.</p>
<p>Half a block off the Trollway, we found the Grumpy Troll brewpub in a
restored 1916 creamery.</p>
<p>On the airy second floor, we listened to the jazzy quartet Harmonious
Wail and ordered beer. We had Liberty Pole ale and the Norwegian Wood,
an India pale ale that's packed with hops — enough, by tradition, to
preserve ale on voyages from Britain to colonial India.</p>
<p>Our inn is in nearby Mineral Point, to which Cornish miners came in the
1830s after the discovery of lead. They were expert stonemasons, which
explains the town's lovely limestone cottages, many now used by
artists, and warehouses, including the 1854 Brewery Creek Inn.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mineral_point_brewery_pub.jpg" alt="Pub in Mineral Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Brewery Creek pub in Mineral Point has an "English pub meets
Wisconsin frontier" look.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We ate
elsewhere but we returned to the cozy pub to draw our own beers — a
Kölsch-style blonde ale, a porter from a 1750 recipe and a
Schwartzbier.</p>
<p>Proprietor and brewmaster Jeff Donaghue eventually joined us, offering
pickled eggs, which we politely declined.</p>
<p>&quot;I call this English pub meets Wisconsin frontier,&quot; he said, waving
at the wood-beamed ceiling and paneling from behind the columned oak
back bar, taken from a clothing store near his former home in a
Minneapolis suburb.</p>
<p>And the rooms are simple and elegant, with walls of glowing limestone,
tiled gas fireplaces, gleaming antiques and Arts and Crafts accents. We
threw lavender salts into the double whirlpool and had a soak, emerging
to wrap ourselves in fluffy robes.</p>
<p>Past Pendarvis, a state historic site where costumed interpreters give
tours of restored miner's cottages, we found Brewery Pottery Studio, in
a huge 1850 stone brewery where Mineral Springs beer was made from 1852
to 1961.</p>
<p>Potters Tom and Diana Johnston live and work here, and Diana Johnston
gave us a tour, including the fermenting room, now a basketball court,
and a series of caverns dug into the hillside.</p>
<p>&quot;They definitely brewed beer here during Prohibition,&quot; she said.
&quot;The story is that when the Feds came, the people would climb a
ladder to the ventilation shaft and scatter.&quot;</p>

Brewery's Bier Garten.

<h3>Drinking with the Swiss</h3>
<p>It's a bucolic drive through rolling farmland to New Glarus, settled in
1845 by colonists from the impoverished Swiss canton of Glarus, and
still a town in which the local German dialect often is heard.</p>
<p>It's a great town in which to drink beer — at the 1853 New Glarus
Hotel,  the wood-beamed Glarner Stube and the 1893 Puempl's, with its
1913 murals of Napoleonic scenes and dollar bills stuck to 18-foot
ceilings.</p>
<p>The beer? New Glarus, of course.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody in town feels a distinct personal ownership in our
beer,&quot; said Dan Carey, a master brewer who opened New Glarus Brewing
in 1993 with Deb, his wife. &quot;We have 2,000 people selling for us.&quot;</p>
<p>Carey worked for a small brewery near Munich and for Anheuser-Busch in
Fort Collins, Colo., before returning to Wisconsin with Deb, a Milwaukee
native. Each of its beers — from the popular Spotted Cow to such
limited-edition Unplugged brews as Smoke on the Porter — is made from
a completely different recipe.</p>
<p>We stocked up on its beer, since it's sold only in Wisconsin. Then we
headed to Monroe, where Huber Brewing was started in 1845.</p>
<p>Mountain Crest Brewing of Calgary, Alberta, bought the brewery in 2006
and renamed it Minhas Craft Brewery, but it's still one of the oldest
continually operating breweries in the nation.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Now it's making such craft beers as Lazy Mutt Farmhouse Ale, but it
also still makes its trademark Berghoff beer.</p>
<p>We had some with bratwurst and barbecued beef at Baumgartner's, an
atmospheric tavern and cheese shop opposite Monroe's beautiful
Romanesque courthouse.</p>
<p>Bartender John Stratton pointed out the old-timers playing the Swiss
card game Jass in the corner. &quot;They play for 15 cents a game,&quot; he
said. &quot;It's blood money.&quot;</p>
<h3>All in the family</h3>
<p>Janesville isn't far away. That's where, in 1854, Irish immigrant
Joshua Gray started bottling soda and beer. Gray's stopped brewing beer
during Prohibition, but when the bottling works burned down in 1993,
great-great-grandson Fred Gray rebuilt it to make both beer and gourmet
sodas.</p>
<p>Today, it's the nation's oldest family-owned bottling company.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw a niche for a good ale brewery,&quot; Fred Gray said. &quot;We just
consider ourselves a brewery — I don't really like the word
&quot;micro&quot;; it's too trendy.&quot; Gray's biggest sellers are Honey
Ale and Old Mill Stout, and his connoisseur's beer is the Oatmeal
Stout.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_glarus_brewery_sign.jpg" alt="Sign at New Glarus Brewing." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
New Glarus Brewing mottoes include "Only In Wisconsin" and "Drink
Indigenous."
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;I'm pretty passionate about my beer,&quot; Gray said.</p>
<p>We didn't go on to Milwaukee, since I've already toured its breweries
(for more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/milwaukee-brewery-tours/">Mad about brew</a> ).</p>
<p>Besides, our trunk already was full of six-packs. We hoped they'd last
a while. Like craft brewers, we're followers of a slogan adapted from
an old German wine adage: &quot;Life is too short to drink cheap beer.&quot;</p>
