<p>Oh, the joy of being German.</p>
<p>There's no question that Germans know how to have a good time. After
all, they've given the world Oktoberfest, half-gallon steins and &quot;The
Little Chicken Dance.&quot;</p>
<p>And what else? Beer, of course, the enjoyment of which is a God-given
right to Germans ‐ their adage &quot;<em>Hopfen und Malz, Gott erhalts</em>&quot;
roughly translates as &quot;Malt and
hops, to God, are tops.&quot;</p>
<p>In Minnesota, there's no town more German than New Ulm, which lets <em>le
bon temps rouler</em> on a tide of beer during
its own brand of Mardi Gras.</p>
<p>In Germany, this Fat Tuesday festival is called Karneval, Fasnacht or,
in southern Germany, from which the first Ulmers came, Fasching.</p>
<p>Like Mardi Gras, it mixes ancient pagan rituals with Lenten traditions,
which makes it particularly apt in New Ulm. The town is so Catholic and
Lutheran that many of its children never set foot in a secular school —
and yet its hero, the tribal warrior Hermann, predates Christianity.</p>

<p>Of course, none of this mattered one bit to the thousands of people
gathered one late-winter Saturday at August Schell Brewery. The sun was
shining, a band was playing and the beer was flowing at a brewery
that's been called the most picturesque in the nation.</p>
<p>It was the annual Bock Fest at the Schell Brewery, founded in 1860 and
the second-oldest family-owned brewery in the nation.</p>
<p>By noon, hundreds had polished off their first glasses of bock, a
caramel-colored beer traditionally drunk in early spring. Hundreds
more were off in the forest, looking for seven other bocks.</p>
<p>Bock, in German, also means billy goat, and Ted Marti,
great-great-grandson of August Schell, had hidden wooden goat-head
cutouts on the grounds and in adjoining Flandrau State Park, good for
prizes of $35 to $150.</p>
<p>He'd given out clues — &quot;Eight naked bodies tanning by the trail&quot;
and &quot;Out of sight, yet sustained by the brewery&quot; — but they were
frustrating the searchers, who were coming out of the brush with nothing
but cockleburs.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now, my main objective is to find my way back,&quot; said Tom
Maloney of nearby Mankato, as he looked for catalpa trees, part of a clue.
&quot;But everybody wins today, the weather is so nice.&quot;</p>

<p>The trails led along the looping Cottonwood River and into the state
park. The Dakota hunted and camped on these prairie bluffs until the
U.S.-Dakota Conflict of 1862, when hungry young Dakota plundered and
burned the young town of New Ulm.</p>
<p>The Schells, however, had shared food with their Dakota neighbors,
and their brewery was unharmed.</p>
<p>Today, this brewery still is a neighborly place; its wooded grounds have
been open to the public since they were landscaped in the 1880s.
Visitors wander the garden pathways around August Schell's 1885 brick
home, admire the peacocks and visit the Museum of Brewing.</p>
<p>On my tour, the guests cheered the guide when she told of the days when
horse-drawn carriages delivered beer house to house, just like milk.</p>
<p>Afterward, we guzzled samples of pils, Firebrick lager, German pale
ale and Schmaltz's Alt, named for Ted Marti's father, Warren.</p>
<p>Outside, the Bock Fest Boys were revving up the beer-guzzling swarms by
playing Johnny Cash's &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; and prompting rounds of the
German victory chant &quot;Zicke Zacke, Zicke Zacke, Heu Heu Heu.&quot;</p>
<p>There was a parade, too, at which the St. Paul Winter Carnival Vulcans,
whose winter-banishing rituals are based on the same traditions that
fuel Fasching, joined New Ulm's Narren.</p>
<p>The Narren, or fools, wear folk costumes and hand-carved wooden masks
with long, bulbous noses and chins; the effect is both sinister and
comic.</p>
<p>By late afternoon, five of the hidden bocks had been captured and
returned. Meanwhile, their namesake beer was making the crowd very, very
happy.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;I think we all found the bock,&quot; said a blissed-out Greg Heilman of
Eden Prairie, Minn., dancing in homemade lederhosen and a hunter's cap,
in which he'd stuck a small German flag.</p>
<p>The party continued that evening in downtown bars and at Turner Hall,
named for the group of German socialists and freethinkers who, in 1854,
founded the town.</p>
<p>The Concord Singers, known as one of the foremost German-language male chorus
in America, are the official hosts of Fasching, and they presided over
the lighthearted singing, dancing and costume parade at Turner Hall.</p>
<p>It was an evening, said Bob Beussman, for good old German
<em>Gemütlichkeit.</em></p>
<p>&quot;What does that mean?&quot; he asked. &quot;To us, it means the warmth and
good times everyone has when they're in the city of New Ulm.&quot;</p>
<p>The town holds lots of festivals, including Bavarian Blast in July and, of course, Oktoberfest in fall.</p>
<p>So the only way to avoid wagging elbows to the &quot;Little Chicken
Dance&quot; is to visit on quieter weekends.</p>
<p>In summer, Schell's gives daily tours, and the spiral staircase of the
1897 Hermann Monument opens to those who want a magnificent view of the
Minnesota River Valley.</p>

<p>Hermann united the Alemannic tribes and routed the Romans in 9 A.D.; he
brandishes his sword atop a 70-foot columned dome in Hermann Heights
Park.</p>
<p>There's modern history downtown in the Brown County Historical Society,
whose stepped gables and bands of brick and white terra cotta make it
look like a wedding cake.</p>
<p>Exhibits tell the story of the early settlers and the native Dakota,
whose cultures eventually clashed so calamitously.</p>
<p>Across the street, the elegant 1887 John Lind House, the home of
Minnesota's 14th governor, is open for tours; so is the 1894 childhood
home of Wanda Gag, author and illustrator of the children's classic
&quot;Millions of Cats.&quot;</p>
<p>The carillon bells of the town Glockenspiel play twice every afternoon
as three animated polka-band figures twirl. Shops fill demand for
imported German goods. Domeiers, on Minnesota Street, is the best-known;
often, bus tours fill the tiny store.</p>
<p>There's not much in the way of German culture the town has overlooked.
And why should it? In New Ulm, being German means good times.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Bock Fest in New Ulm, Minnesota</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> It's 1¾ hours west of the Twin Cities, longer
during rush hours.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.schellsbrewery.com/events/bock-fest/">Bockfest</a>:</em> It's
March 4 in 2023.</p>
<p>Brewery tours no longer are offered during the festival, which has
become so popular that brewery gates close after capacity is reached and
people are admitted only as others leave.</p>
