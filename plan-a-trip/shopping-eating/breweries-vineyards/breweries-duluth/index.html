<p>From Duluth News Tribune, June 2019: Dave Hoops says his brewery is like his living room �plenty of beer options, food from all over, sports on TV � but these long tables shared by strangers make it more like Duluth's living room.</p>
<p>As the destination brew hall in Canal Park celebrates two years on Saturday, Hoops said he is pleased if not somewhat surprised at how things have shaped up at Hoops Brewing: almost exactly according to plan.</p>
<p>&quot;That German-style beer hall, the community beer hall was, frankly, the one thing that I really wanted to do,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a viable business model in today's environment.&quot;</p>
<p>As the brewery boom matures, businesses are looking beyond the beer to stand out. Blacklist has axe throwing; Ursa Minor has wood-fired pizza. Canal Park Brewing has lakeside seating; Lake Superior Brewing puts you right next to the bright tanks. Bent Paddle reinvigorated a historic venue; so has Thirsty Pagan.</p>
<p>In an age where consumers can buy everything they want online or, in the case of breweries, at liquor stores, there has been a major push toward &quot;experiential&quot; everything. It works, too: Data shows that people who go to breweries drink more beer than those who don't.</p>
<p>&quot;Getting people into breweries is a good thing for the beer industry, or more broadly, that everyone in beer should not just support brewery visits, but actively try to re-create the reasons people go to breweries,&quot; Brewers Association chief economist Bart Watson writes. &quot;Give beer lovers the variety, experience and quality they are looking for and the volume will follow.&quot;</p>
<p>Hoops had that idea from the start � make it about the place as much as the product. He expects to sell 85 percent of his beer in-house this year, just a slight decrease from years before.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm focused and fixated on this room,&quot; Hoops said. &quot;How do I get more butts in seats, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Let's not forget the beer, though.</p>
<p>As we talked last week, Hoops is handed a glass of the new cherry ale tapped for Saturday's festivities � he gets his nose in the glass, sips and doesn't slug, before handing down his verdict.</p>
<p>&quot;That is great.&quot;</p>
<p>While many craft drinkers still favor their hoppy IPAs � and Hoops does oblige them � variety is the one constant on his growing taplist. That's a trend drinkers will notice around town, as well, with rotating experimental taps or small-batch brews that probably won't end up in cans or bottles. Place, meet product.</p>
<p>While cans (crowlers, rather) of Hoops beer can be found in a handful of stores, the brewery is riding on slow and methodical expansion. So for those who ask him if he's going to start stocking their local liquor store the long answer is Hoops still self-distributes, meaning the short answer is probably not anytime soon.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm trying really hard to stick with the model we're trying to do here,&quot; he said. &quot;I care about these people first that came all the way down here.&quot;</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon a handful of visitors dotted the expansive beer hall, and it would fill out nicely for the weekly cribbage tournament that night. While weekends are reliably busy and the weeknight events help, Hoops said if his model is to succeed it needs to succeed every night: &quot;There are a lot of hours between those weekends.&quot;</p>
