<h2>On a fall girlfriend getaway, we hike, eat and sip our way along the river valley.</h2>

<p>For some people, &quot;Wisconsin wine&quot; is a puzzling concept, like &quot;New York
nice.&quot;</p>
<p>But grapes do grow in Wisconsin, primarily on the high ridges of the
Wisconsin River, near its confluence with the Mississippi. There, vines
bask in sunlight and frosts sink into valleys.</p>
<p>What vintners can't grow they truck in from other states, adding a
Wisconsin <em>je ne sais quoi</em> to the grapes
during blending, fermentation and aging.</p>
<p>Wisconsinites now are enthusiastic supporters of their local vineyards,
thanks largely to the late Bob Wollersheim, who resurrected the state's
first vineyard in 1972.</p>
<p>He made good wines, but more importantly, he made wine-buying fun,
holding tasting events and festivals at his oak-framed hillside
vineyard.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin River Valley isn't the Napa Valley. But it also doesn't
have a shred of snobbery.</p>
<p>&quot;We try to show people they can drink and buy what they like,&quot; says
Julie Wollersheim Coquard, who married the French-born winemaker her
father recruited. &quot;They don't have to drink what's 'supposed' to be
good.&quot;</p>
<p>One October, four girlfriends and I devoted the weekend to fall scenery,
hiking trails, good food-and wine.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Wisconsin River vineyards occupy some of the most picturesque terrain in
the state, and on our way to Spurgeon Vineyards near Muscoda, we admired
little country churches, waved at Amish men pulling weeds and stopped to
pet a trio of billy goats.</p>
<p>At the winery, we met Mary Spurgeon, who'd just returned from Michigan
that morning with six tons of chardonnay grapes, and watched as her
husband, Glen, dumped the grapes into the press.</p>
<p>They planted their first vines in 1978 and became the first vinters in
Wisconsin to use only their own grapes, Mary Spurgeon said, but their
saleswoman sold so much wine they had to start buying grapes to
supplement those from their own 16 acres.</p>
<p>We tasted the dry, oak-aged Proprietor's Reserve Red first, then moved
on to the grapey Proprietor's Reserve White and the sweet Ruby Lady,
the vineyard's best-selling wine.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't care what anybody says, sugar sells,&quot; Spurgeon told us. &quot;Our
top three sellers are sweet; if we dropped everything else except those,
we'd still thrive.&quot;</p>
<p>Then we climbed up a steep hill to the vines, where we soaked up some
sun ourselves and tasted a few grapes, which were packed with flavor.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_green_cave.jpg" alt="Cave in Tower Hill State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Spring Green, Tower Hill State Park includes a limestone tunnel and
shot tower.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then we drove to Botham Vineyards near Barnveld, which looked like a
Wisconsin Falcon Crest. Fittingly, the vintner, Peter Botham, races
vintage cars.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I'd like to have a vineyard,&quot; said my friend Grace, looking
covetously at the owners' Victorian painted-lady, on a manicured knoll
above the red-barn tasting room and picnic terrace.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, this looks as if it could be in California,&quot; said Adele.</p>
<p>Botham doesn't offer tours, so we went straight for the wine, starting
with the driest, the estate-grown Uplands Reserve.</p>
<p>Our lively guide, college student Sara Gullicksrud, provided a running
commentary on each wine, and when I said I'd serve the semi-dry Riesling
as a dessert wine, she laughed.</p>
<p>&quot;That's what's so fun about this job,&quot; Gullicksrud said. &quot;One person
will say, 'Whoa, this is so sweet,' and the next will say, 'It's not
sweet enough, I need it so much sweeter.' &quot;</p>
<p>We all were impressed with Botham's wine, and we left with armfuls of
it, as well as Bolivian wine bags and Stonehill Kitchen chocolate sauces
from the gift shop.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then we took country roads back to the Wisconsin River, where we got in
a late-afternoon hike in Tower Hill State Park near Spring Green. In
1831, enterpreneurs built a shot tower on the hill, dropping balls of
molten lead 180 feet into a pool of water.</p>
<p>The wooded trail led us into the limestone tunnel through which the shot
was retrieved and up to the rebuilt tower, where we had a sweeping view
of the river valley.</p>
<p>From Tower Hill, we headed straight east to Mazomanie, where the popular
Old Feed Mill operates in an 1857 stone mill. It's famous for its pot
roast and cider roast chicken, but we were surprised to see chef's
selections that included sturgeon, wild boar and veal loin.</p>
<p>My New Zealand cherry lamb was delectable, and so was my friends'
chicken and the Lake Louis pale ale, made just down the road in Arena.</p>
<p>The next morning, we followed the river to Wollersheim Winery, across
from Prairie du Sac. The vineyard has quite a history: In 1840, a flashy
Hungarian count named Agoston Haraszthy arrived in the valley with root
stock from Europe, which he planted on a sheltered hillside.</p>
<p>He founded Sauk City, first known as Haraszthyville, but in 1849 he left
for California, where he became the first sheriff of San Diego,
co-founder of the San Francisco Mint and the California wine
commissioner.</p>
<p>He may or may not have been eaten by alligators in Nicaragua while
operating the world's largest rum factory, but he certainly is known as
the father of the California wine industry.</p>

Wollersheim Winery is tucked into the side of a bluff above the
Wisconsin River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Back in Wisconsin, the count's vineyard was taken over by Peter Kehl, an
immigrant from Germany's Rhineland, and cultivated by the family until
1899, a year of record-setting cold that saw the demise of both the
vines and Peter's son Jacob.</p>
<p>In 1972, Bob and JoAnn Wollersheim bought the dilapidated farm, moving
into Peter Kehl's 1858 limestone house and planting hardy Marechal Foch
vines along the wooded ridge above it, on which more than 100 eagles
roost in winter.</p>
<p>Today, people love to visit the picturesque vineyard, framed by giant
oaks.</p>
<p>&quot;Once again, you feel you're not in the Midwest,&quot; Adele said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going with Portugal,&quot; said Sandy.</p>
<p>After a walk around the grounds, we again tasted from dry to sweet,
starting with the pinot noir and going on to the Domaine du Sac, the dry
Riesling and the Prairie Fumé, which is by far the vineyard's best
seller.</p>
<p>Of the three vineyards, we agreed, Wollersheim was most atmospheric,
Spurgeon was most fun and Botham had the best wines. But all of them had
one thing in common.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll tell you a secret,&quot; Mary Spurgeon had told us. &quot;We're in the
entertainment business. Why do people come to a winery? To spend time
and be entertained. When you come into the winery, you're buying an
experience.&quot;</p>
