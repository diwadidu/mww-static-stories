<p>For people who love beer, there's no better place to drink it than in a
brewery.</p>
<p>In 1880s, beer-loving Milwaukee had more than 80 of them. Three became
national giants, giving Milwaukee the nicknames Beer Town and Suds City,
but only one survived.</p>
<p>That's Miller, acquired in 1969 by Philip Morris and now part of Molson
Coors. Schlitz closed in 1981, and Pabst in 1997.</p>
<p>Enter the first upstarts.</p>
<p>In 1985, Sprecher became the first brewery to start up in Milwaukee
since Prohibition. Against Miller's Lite, it put up beers with so much
heft you could have them for lunch: Black Bavarian, Russian imperial
stout, Doppelbock.</p>
<p>Lakefront brewed its first beer in 1987, after Russ Klisch bought his
brother Jim a home-brewing kit and soon found himself competing to see
who could make the best beer.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The brothers brewed fast and furiously-the first fruit beer since
Prohibition, the first certified organic beer, the first gluten-free
beer, a spicy pumpkin lager. With Sprecher, they put the love back into
the beer.</p>
<p>All three breweries offer tours, all different but all popular: You get
to drink the beer.</p>
<p>And when you're done with those, visit the new upstarts: the dozens of
<a href="https://www.milwaukeemag.com/brewery-boom-new-milwaukee-breweries/">craft
breweries</a>
popping up around the city. Many of them offer
<a href="https://jsonline.com/story/entertainment/beer/2018/12/20/guide-milwaukees-fun-and-funny-brewery-tours/2152876002/">tours</a>.</p>
<h3>Lakefront Brewery</h3>
<p>It's safe to say that Lakefront's is the most fun. I got there an hour
early, riding my bike from downtown past the old Schlitz brewery and
through the rejuvenated Beerline B neighborhood. Already, 15 people were
in line for the 1 p.m. tour.</p>
<p>At 12:35 p.m., we showed our IDs and were ushered inside a cavernous
hall, where we got a plastic glass, four coupons for beer and a voucher
for a free beer that afternoon at one of 13 restaurants.</p>
<p>I could see that some serious drinking lay ahead, so I bought a slice of
Meglio's pizza to have with a glass of the Rendezvous Ale, a French
country ale that was light but more substantial than New Glarus' popular
Spotted Cow, a Wisconsin farmhouse ale.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lakefront_mug.jpg" alt="Lakefront Brewery tour." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Lakefront's tour, "the only rule is to have a good time."
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>That went down pretty easily, so I followed it with a glass of Wheat
Monkey, which our guide, Joe, said was &quot;flying off the shelves.&quot;</p>
<p>Standing in front of three fermentation tanks painted with the images of
the Three Stooges, Joe told us the only rule at Lakefront is to have a
good time.</p>
<p>&quot;There's always someone who's been here as many times as I have, and the
reason is what we have in our hand, it's the beer,&quot; he said. &quot;Okay,
who's been here 25 times? 35 times? More than 100?&quot;</p>
<p>He told us about the home-brewing kit that started it all and claimed
that the city sold the current brewery, an old power plant, to the
Klisch brothers in return for &quot;free beer for life.&quot;</p>
<p>The brewing process is basically the same everywhere: In the mash tun,
grain is steeped in hot water. After the grain is strained out, the
resulting wort is boiled and hops are added. It's cooled and sent to
fermenting tanks, where yeast is added.</p>
<p>But at Lakefront, Joe explained what the yeast does after it devours the
sugars in the wort: &quot;It does what we do when we eat too much. The yeast
is going to poop-poop out alcohol and carbon dioxide, which creates
carbonation. Then it reproduces with itself and parties.&quot;</p>
<p>The used-up grain, he said, is fed to worms, whose waste becomes organic
fertilizer. For good measure, he added that the cups from which we were
drinking were made from old plastic bags and diapers and also will be
composted.</p>
<p>Yum! But no one stopped drinking.</p>
<p>Then Joe showed us the original Bernie Brewer's Chalet from the old
County Stadium, which the Klisches bought as a souvenir. He pointed to
its famous slide.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Bernie would only slide down it when the Brewers hit a home run, so of
course it's in perfect shape,&quot; he cracked.</p>
<p>In the bottling room, Joe made us sing &quot;Making Our Dreams Come True,&quot;
the theme song from &quot;Laverne and Shirley,&quot; the TV sitcom that was based
in the fictional Schotz Brewery in Milwaukee and ran from 1975 to 1983:
&quot;Schlemiel! Schlimazel! Hasenpfeffer Incorporated!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you don't sing, we'll send you out that exit door, and that way
there's no more beers,&quot; he warned.</p>
<p>But I made it onto the sunny riverside patio where tour guests can spend
as much time as they want, using up their coupons and watching the Brew
City Queen II tour boat chug up and down the river between Lakefront and
two brewpubs, the Milwaukee Ale House and Rock Bottom Brewery.</p>
<p>I only had room for one more beer, so I tried the Riverwest Stein amber
lager, which Joe said was the brewery's most popular.</p>
<p>&quot;People think it's too dark, but then they taste it,&quot; he said. I could
see why the brewery is so popular. Its beers are deceptively mild,
pleasing to most palates yet packed with flavor.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/sprecher_truck.jpg" alt="A traveling beer garden." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Milwaukee Parks</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3>Sprecher Brewery</h3>
<p>At Sprecher, the beers are as chewy as a slice of multigrain bread.
Started in 1985 by Randal Sprecher, a former Pabst supervisor, it takes
the Belgian view that beer is the bread of life.</p>
<p>And sure enough, on the tour, we got up close and personal with the
ingredients, smelling hops pellets and tasting barley-malt grains --
yum, just like a bowl of Grape-Nuts.</p>
<p>Brewmasters can tinker with the beer at many points. Corn, rice or wheat
can be used as grains along with various barley malts, which, when
roasted, give beer color and flavor-of coffee, caramel or chocolate,
for example.</p>
<p>The type of hops used gives it aroma, and its bitterness balances the
sweetness of the malt. Like Lakefront, one of Sprecher's bestsellers is
a Viennese-style lager, the Special Amber.</p>
<p>Its flavors span the globe-in addition to its German-style Black
Bavarian and Hefe Weiss, it also produces the Belgian Abbey Triple,
Irish Stout and Austrian-style Radlers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Ironically, for the first Milwaukee brewery to open since Prohibition,
Sprecher is just as well known for its delectable sodas, which are
ubiquitous in gourmet delis.</p>
<p>On this brewery tour, you're likely to drink just as much of its root
beer and cream soda, and it makes seven other soft drinks, including
Orange Dream, Grape and Cherry Cola.</p>
<h3>MolsonCoors</h3>
<p>And then there's the MolsonCoors brewery tour. It's just as popular as
the other two, because more people still drink Miller Lite than craft
beers.</p>
<p>When I went, it was only 11 a.m. on a chilly Saturday, and already 94
people were gunning for a taste of High Life.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, you all signed the Enthusiasm Clause before going on the tour,&quot;
shouted a peppy young guide named Ryan. &quot;So I'll be assessing your
enthusiasm to see if you get the free samples.&quot;</p>
<p>We had gathered in Miller Valley, along the Menomonee River, to hear the
story of Frederick Miller, a royal brewmaster in Germany who had New
World-size ambitions.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_miller_tour.jpg" alt="A group touring Miller Brewing in Milwaukee." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A tour group heads for the Caves Museum of Miller Brewery in Milwaukee.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>One day, he packed up his yeast and decamped to America, where, in 1855,
he bought a small brewery in Milwaukee. Miller not only knew how to make
beer, he knew how to make people want to drink beer.</p>
<p>Over the years, he and his sons gave social cachet to a workingman's
beverage. They opened a beer garden and used catchy slogans â€” for High
Life, it was &quot;the Champagne of Bottle Beers,&quot; winner of a 1903 contest
â€” and symbols, such as the Girl in the Moon, a coy damsel perched on a
crescent.</p>
<p>Thus Miller beers became part of the fabric of Milwaukee, and the city's
beautiful new ball park bears its name.</p>
<p>The nice family success story grinds to a halt in 1969, when Miller was
acquired by tobacco giant Philip Morris. In 2002, South African Brewing
bought it, and in 2008, it merged with Coors. In 2016, the Belgian
multinational InBev acquired SABMiller, which then sold its stake in
MillerCoors to Molson Coors.</p>
<p>Today, it's a little hard to work up much enthusiasm for a global
conglomerate that's best known for making Miller Lite and 30 other
brands of American-style pilsener.</p>
<p>The tour include a flashy video, but it's as insubstantial as the beer.
We looked through a glassed-in balcony at a room full of machinery and
got a dizzying 30-second explanation of brewing as we looked at a row of
kettles.</p>
<p>However, the Caves Museum and wood-paneled Miller Inn pub, where we
drank our samples, were quite atmospheric.</p>
<p>They should be, considering the brewery's age and history. Even if a
tour guide's explanation of the brewing process makes your eyes glaze
over, the story behind the beer always is interesting.</p>

<h3>Where to drink beer</h3>
<p>Great bars and brewpubs are legion. But one of the most popular places
to drink in the summer is <strong><a href="http://www.oldgermanbeerhall.com/estabrook-beer-garden/">Estabrook Beer
Garden</a></strong> in
Estabrook Park, on the Milwaukee River and Oak Leaf Trail north of
downtown.</p>
<p>Modeled on beer gardens in modern-day Munich, it features German beer
served in half- and full-liter glass mugs, shared tables, polka music
and fresh-baked German pretzels and wurst.</p>
<p>People also can bring their own food, and dogs are allowed. In the park,
there's a dog park, disc golf and a riverfront boardwalk.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="http://county.milwaukee.gov/Parks/BeerGardens">beer
gardens</a> in Humboldt,
Hoyt and South Shore parks. Others parks are served by a traveling beer
truck from Sprecher Brewing. There's live music at each of the stops
from Wednesday through Saturday.</p>
<p>In Glendale, the <a href="http://www.thebavarianbierhaus.com/">Bavarian Bier
Haus</a> has a large beer garden. On
the four weekends after Labor Day, it hosts the annual Oktoberfest in
adjoining Old Heidelberg Park.</p>
<h3>Where to stay</h3>
<p>The 90-suite <strong><a href="http://www.brewhousesuites.com/">Brewhouse Inn &amp;
Suites</a></strong> now occupies parts of the
1877 Pabst Brewery. It's built of Cream City brick and is the
centerpiece of the new Brewery neighborhood around the 20-acre complex.</p>
<h3><strong>Getting around</strong></h3>
<p>It's easiest by bike. Not far from Schlitz Park, the paved, 3.7-mile
<a href="https://city.milwaukee.gov/Beerline-B-Trail">Beerline Trail</a> heads
north on the west side of the Milwaukee River, passing Lakefront
Brewery. The trail is lined with murals and public art.</p>
