<h2>Craft breweries are popping up all over, offering taprooms, music and food trucks.</h2>

Bad Weather's taproom is on West Seventh Street, not far from downtown

<p>It used to be that rebellious young men started garage bands. Now, they
start garage breweries.</p>
<p>Bud, Coors and Miller may rule the beer world, but craft brewers are its
rock stars. At first, they made their own, getting supplies from St.
Paul's Northern Brewer (&quot;good beer is your right&quot;).</p>
<p>Then, they started real breweries with names like Surly (&quot;the anger
fueled by the inability to find good beers&quot;) and Flat Earth (&quot;join
the movement against the reign of watered-down domestics&quot;).</p>
<p>Summit Brewing has supplied the Twin Cities with good beer since 1986.
But in 2006, Surly led a second, edgier wave of microbreweries that
stirred the pot with heaps of hops, exotic malts and beers named
Furious, Abrasive and Cynic.</p>
<p>The fans who loved them became known as Surly Nation and pushed the
so-called &quot;Surly bill,&quot; which passed in 2011 and allows Minnesota
breweries to sell their own beer on the premises.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Now, the rebels are going mainstream, offering tap rooms and also tours,
trivia nights and food trucks.</p>
<p>Breweries are popping up all over the Twin Cities; now, nearly every
neighborhood has one.</p>
<p>Yet the Twin Cities are nowhere near the saturation point for
microbreweries; Minnesota is 13th in the nation in <a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics/by-state/">craft beer produced
per capita</a>.</p>
<p>The craft-beer segment of the U.S. market still is small, but it's
growing.</p>
<p>&quot;Ninety-five percent of people don't know any better, or they're
scared of craft beer,&quot; says brewer Broc Krekelberg. &quot;But once they
try it, they say, 'Holy buckets, that's pretty good.' &quot;</p>
<h3>Visiting the breweries</h3>
<p>Two companies offer organized van tours, with a different slate of
breweries each day: <a href="http://www.hoppytrolley.com/#">Hoppy Trolley Craft Brewery
Tours</a> and <a href="http://bitterminnesotabrewerytours.com">Bitter
Minnesota</a>.</p>

called growlers.</p>

regardless of age.</p>
