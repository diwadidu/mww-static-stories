<h2>In central Wisconsin, shoppers flock to a flea market like bees to clover.</h2>

<p>In an up-and-down economy, people still like to shop, even if they
can't spend much.</p>
<p>That's turned out pretty well for the town of Princeton, which operates
Wisconsin's largest outdoor weekly flea market in its tree-shaded City
Park.</p>
<p>The last years have been busier than ever for the market: For a buck or
two, anyone can find a treasure, even if it's a bag of marbles or a
freshly baked pastry.</p>
<p>Thousands of people stream into Princeton on sunny Saturdays, providing
part of the show. Think looking at stuff in flea markets is pretty fun?
Try watching the people who look at the stuff.</p>
<p>The man who lifted the lid off a crystal candy dish, for example, just
like the several dozen people before him.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Everyone has to pick up covers; it's a human urge to pick up
covers,&quot; the late Appleton, Wis., dealer Norm Simon told me when I was
there. &quot;It's fun to see the personalities, the way people think.&quot;</p>
<p>At the Princeton Flea Market, I got a lesson in psychology. Ever wonder
why flea-market stuff always is in such a haphazard pile? It's not
because the dealers are slobs-it's because customers want to think
they've &quot;discovered&quot; something.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have your stuff all organized, that's no fun; it's like
shopping at Walmart,&quot; Simon told me. &quot;People like to find something
under a box.&quot;</p>
<p>I watched as three different people asked the price of a rocker, and
Simon quoted three different numbers.</p>
<p>&quot;Another thing people don't understand is attitude,&quot; he
said.&quot;Price changes according to attitude. Some guy comes in and says,
'Oh, I'm a big expert on this . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;. . . and he pays top dollar,&quot; said Robin Simon, a third-generation
dealer who met Norm at a flea market.</p>

<p>It's an entertaining game, and people come from miles around to play
it. Whether they go home with a pair of lime-green bookends or a rare
tin toy, they're happy looking.</p>
<p>&quot;For us, it's the thrill of the hunt,&quot; Norm Simon said. &quot;Once I
bought two toy trucks for 15 cents and sold them for $900 to a person
who flew in from New York to pick them up.</p>
<p>&quot;You make mistakes, too,&quot; he said. &quot;Once I sold a piece of Carnival
glass for $100, and later the guy went down to St. Louis and sold it
for $2,800. But I only paid $10 for it, so it was a good deal for me.
If I said, 'I could have done this, I could have done that,' I'd go
nuts.&quot;</p>
<p>Sixty years ago, Princeton was a sleepy town with so many taverns it was
listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>
<p>Its beginnings were more promising. Father Marquette came through in
1673, erecting a cross the town still maintains, and the town prospered
from its position on the Fox River, whose waters turned the engine of
industrialization in Wisconsin.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The huge saw and paper mills were downstream, but Princeton claimed fame
through shipping-especially navy beans, through which it acquired
the nickname Beantown-and selling, at a monthly Cattle Fair to which
people came to buy and sell goods of all kinds.</p>
<p>And selling is still what Princeton does best. The big draw is the flea
market, which has as many as 180 vendors each week and a carnival
atmosphere.</p>
<p>&quot;I love this flea market; it's the best variety of everything, not
just antiques,&quot; said Joan Herbst, who had driven in from Theresa,
Wis. &quot;Not everybody likes antiques. Today, we bought T-shirts, and I
bought Barbies for my granddaughters. Oh, and I bought a doily. And I
like all the food-especially the mini-doughnuts.&quot;</p>
<p>The flea market attracted antiques shops, which drew more shoppers, then
more shops.</p>
<p>That was just the beginning. Locals, tired of looking at the boarded-up
downtown, went after new tenants for its neglected brick storefronts.</p>

<p>Princeton isn't far from the resort town of Green Lake, Wisconsin's
deepest lake and a traditional vacation spot for Chicagoans. Over the
years, it's drawn upscale outposts to the little downtown on the Fox
River.</p>
<p>And it's the flea market that helped bring people to the more upscale
shops.</p>
