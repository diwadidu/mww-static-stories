<h2>On the shores of Elkhart Lake, a luxury resort imports a slice of Germany.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/a/santa_osthoff.jpg" alt="Father Christmas with child on his lap." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>No one knows how to celebrate Christmas like the Germans.</p>
<p>It's thanks to them that Americans decorate Christmas trees, hang
wreaths and put nutcrackers on mantels. Because of them, we bake
gingerbread men, open Advent calendars and fill stockings with treats.</p>
<p>Still, not every German Christmas tradition has crossed the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Since the Middle Ages, German towns have held a Christ-child market, or
Christkindlmarkt, in their market squares.</p>
<p>During Advent, rustic timber booths draped with fragrant evergreen
boughs line the squares, selling wooden toys, blown-glass ornaments,
cones of warm sugared almonds and steaming mugs of spiced Glühwein to
festive shoppers.</p>
<p>It's a charming tradition, but a hard one to import: We have malls in
the United States, not market squares.</p>
<p>But that hasn't stopped the Osthoff Resort in Elkhart Lake from
creating one anyway, complete with traditional German wares, food and
even vendors.</p>
<p>Founded in 1886 by a former Prussian soldier named Otto Osthoff, this
lake resort in heavily German eastern Wisconsin first was called the
Hotel Münsterland.</p>
<p>The Osthoff family ran it until 1955, then sold it to a Chicago couple
who turned it into a theater camp. In 1989, the resort was sold to
investors and the old buildings were razed.</p>
<p>Today, the Osthoff is a sprawling, faux-Victorian condominium resort and
conference center that caters to affluent Chicagoans and, despite its
name, is as American as can be.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But for 10 days each December, the Osthoff returns to its roots.</p>
<p>Inside a big white tent, Father Christmas passes out candy canes,
sentimental folk tunes play over the sound system and local
restaurateurs cook up plates of sauerbraten, schnitzel and spaetzle.</p>
<p>Shoppers drift from booth to booth, laden with the wares of vendors who,
it turns out, are happy to make the trip to this resort town near Lake
Michigan.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a dream vacation for me,&quot; says Gerhard Lippmann, who carries
on the wood-carving business that was founded in 1899 by his grandfather
in the Thuringian town of Empfertshausen, seized by the East German
government in 1972, then restored to the family in 1990.</p>
<p>The jovial Lippmann, who likes to tease his customers in German, is one
of the most popular vendors. One of his loyal customers is James Peychal
of Milwaukee, who likes to spend afternoons on a stool in Lippmann's
booth, next to shelves lined with hand-carved and hand-painted
nutcrackers, smokers, bookends and folk figures.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/s/osthoff_ornament_shoppers.jpg" alt="Ornament shopping at the Osthoff." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;I came at 2 p.m. and didn't even get past Gerhard's booth,&quot; he
said. &quot;I like wood carving, and those two shelves there, it's hard to
find the quality and beauty of carving like that. Around here,
everything is resin and Wal-Mart; this is the real thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Peychal said he's made 30 trips to Europe and particularly likes
Bavaria, in Germany.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't always go to Europe, but this is very authentic,&quot; he said.
&quot;The idea he's from Germany, speaking German, is infectious for me.&quot;</p>
<p>In another corner of the tent, Vaclav and Nadia Cinadr had put out a
dazzling array of traditional blown-glass ornaments: delicate globes,
glittering icicles, silver and gold swans with gracefully arching necks
and feathered tails.</p>
<p>Czechs who now live near Milwaukee, the Cinadrs make their living
selling Czech and Slovak ornaments at trade shows, then finish out the
year at the Osthoff, where they sell their wares at a price never seen
in retail stores.</p>
<p>&quot;See, for $5.50, people can buy something very, very pretty like
this,&quot; said Vaclav Cinadr, holding up a globe with blue and silver
snowflakes, &quot;and they will not throw it in the garbage; they'll keep
it for years. Tomorrow morning, they'll be in a line waiting to fill
their baskets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's scary,&quot; Nadia Cinadr said. &quot;People get in a big line, and it
stops right here, but nothing gets broken. They wait so patiently.&quot;</p>
<p>A few of their pieces reflect the gaudy colors introduced by American
entrepreneur Christopher Radko, and a few have non-traditional themes,
such as spiders or soccer balls.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But they're all made in European workshops, unlike Old World Christmas
Co. ornaments, which were made from old German molds in the 1980s and
'90s, when they helped popularize old-fashioned ornaments, but now are
made in China.</p>
<p>&quot;If you look at the tag, it says, 'A tradition to cherish,' &quot;
Vaclav Cinadr said. &quot;But what kind of tradition is an ornament made in
China?&quot;</p>
<p>As she carefully packs up six glass swans, Nadia Cinadr lowers the price
even more. &quot;This is very traditional,&quot; she says approvingly. &quot;In
Europe, you will see a swan on every tree.&quot;</p>
<p>June Anderson of Wausau, Wis., also makes her living at trade shows,
selling an exquisite collection of enameled ceramics from Uzbekistan and
Russian Father Frost figures, nesting dolls and pecking hens, signed on
the bottom with the name of the artist and the town where they were
made.</p>
<p>Most of the goods come from a single village near Moscow, where Anderson
negotiates for them using her &quot;30 words of Russian.&quot; For years, she's
been selling her finds at the Osthoff.</p>

The Osthoff Resort is named for a 19th-century resort owner who
emigrated from Prussia.

<p>&quot;It's so cool to see people coming back to me every year; it's fun,&quot;
she said. &quot;Is this your first time here? Well, it's about time you
showed up.&quot;</p>
<p>Other booths sell Czech crystal, Polish pottery and etched ornaments
from Egypt. Vendors from Germany sell lace, straw ornaments and
ceramics.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to buy plump, iced gingerbread boys or girls from the
Ovens of Gracie O'Malley, which also sells cellophane bags of
gingerbread plums and pears, dusted with real gold.</p>
<p>Few resist a cone of the warm, roasted almonds that are a staple at
German festivals. And for many, a bite of the potato pancakes, eaten
with applesauce and sour cream, will be a reminder of childhood, perhaps
of grandmother's cooking.</p>
<p>&quot;It's 80 percent German and Polish here, though there are still some
of us French-Canadians around,&quot; said Michelle Maurer of nearby New
Holstein.</p>
<p>Maurer is an anomaly at the market, selling necklaces of crystal and
glass beads she makes herself. But her elegant, inexpensive necklaces
sell well, and she keeps getting invited back.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;I love this show,&quot; she said. &quot;I see stuff I've never seen before.
The beer garden is nice, and I love the evergreen smell. By now, we all
know each other. It's like a tribe of gypsies.&quot;</p>
<p>By mid-morning on the first Saturday of the market, the weekend crowds
begin to arrive. Sure enough, Vaclav and Nadia Cinadr's booth is mobbed
with people snapping up fragile glass baubles at bargain prices.</p>
<p>&quot;I put out so much, people can't leave without buying something,&quot;
Nadia Cinadr says with glee. &quot;We have so much fun here.&quot;</p>
