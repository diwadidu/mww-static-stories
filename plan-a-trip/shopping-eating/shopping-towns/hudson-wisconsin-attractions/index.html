<h2>The Wisconsin river town of Hudson has a treat for every visitor.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/u/hudson_sign.jpg" alt="The entrance to Hudson's Lakefront Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 1936 Hudson arch draws visitors into Lakefront Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From the beginning, the St. Croix River has shaped Hudson's identity.</p>
<p>The first settlers came by canoe on the fur-trade highway. The first
steamboat docked in 1847, and soon logs were floating down the St. Croix
to sawmills in Hudson and its neighbor on the Minnesota side,
Stillwater.</p>
<p>Hudson's 1913 toll bridge became a landmark on the St. Croix, fattening
town coffers after the lumber boom ended. The bridge closed in 1951, but
its raised bed still stretches partway over the river, giving residents
and visitors a place to stroll on warm summer evenings.</p>
<p>Today, the St. Croix River is the only thing separating Hudson from the
Twin Cities, which have spread right up to the opposite banks.</p>
<p>Some tourists arrive via boat, walking the block from the river to the
restaurants on Second Street. Others drive over from Minnesota to poke
around in the shops and see the regal Victorian homes on Third Street.</p>
<p>The neighborhood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places
and includes the Octagon House museum, built in 1855 for the New York
judge who named Hudson.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Everyone is drawn to the river by the 1936 arch that leads to Lakefront
Park. Bands play on summer evenings, and families spend the day at the
beach, which has a handsome Arts and Crafts-style bath house.</p>
<p>The Phipps Center for the Arts overlooks the park and is a venue for
plays, concerts and art exhibits year-round.</p>
<p>Stillwater is better known as a day-trip destination, though it has no
beach or theater, and tourists clog its streets in summer and fall. But
the I-94 bridge separates Hudson from the Twin Cities enough to keep
crowds at bay.</p>
<p>Hudson still feels like a small town, not a suburb. Yet the shops in its
compact downtown-there's only room for a few streets at the foot of
the bluffs-have a big-city sensibility that's popular with
visitors.</p>
<p>Abigail Page Antiques, named after the first white child born in Hudson,
was one of the first destinations, a consortium of dealers who sell
pop-culture relics, consignment furniture and home decor.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/u/hudson_octagon_house.jpg" alt="Hudson's Octagon House." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Seasons on St. Croix Gallery carries an alluring array of pottery,
glass, jewelry, paintings and metalwork from 130 artists, five of whom
work in studios on-site.</p>
<p>After a hard day shopping, visitors can settle into one of the Second
Street restaurants for a meal inspired by the cuisine of Italy, Germany,
the Caribbean or the Southwest.</p>
<p>But first, they must stop by a shop that is just up the hill on Locust
Street. Knoke's Chocolates is perhaps the most-loved shop in Hudson by
adults and children alike.</p>
<p>It's candy for the eyes as well as taste buds, lined with glass jars
full of gummies, licorice, pastel malted-milk balls and old-fashioned
penny candy.</p>
<p>Owner David Knoke makes its European-style molded truffles by hand,
filling them with ganaches flavored by Grand Marnier, espresso and
amaretto. There's also caramel corn, fudge and peanut brittle; no one
gets away without buying a bag of something.</p>

<p>Beer lovers won't want to miss Casanova Liquors, which occupies an 1896
brewery set into a hillside along Coulee Road. For many years,
Wisconsin's drinking age was 18, and underage Minnesotans flocked to
its bars.</p>
<p>There's no longer any reason to come for tap beer, but Wisconsin stores
carry many great microbrews that don't ship outside the state.</p>
<p>Casanova not only has one of the region's best selections of craft
beers, it sells them all by the bottle, allowing customers to sample
a broad selection of porters, stouts and ales.</p>
<p>You can visit Hudson for the beach life, the historic houses or picnics
in blufftop parks. But get to know it, and you'll find yourself
returning for the treats.</p>
