<h2>In laid-back Spring Green, any day is worth celebrating.</h2>

If it's your birthday, admission to over-the-top House on the Rock is

<p>People converge on Spring Green, Wis., for many good reasons: To admire
Frank Lloyd Wright masterpieces. To hear Shakespeare at American Players
Theatre. To see world-class kitsch at House on the Rock.</p>
<p>But what brought me to Spring Green? Free stuff.</p>
<p>Spring Green calls itself &quot;The Birthday Town,&quot; because people
celebrating birthdays can go around to its businesses collecting free
loot, like trick-or-treaters. It's like having another holiday, except
you're the only one who gets to celebrate it.</p>
<p>I already know and like the town. So it was an easy thing to tweak my
weekend itinerary a bit and land in Spring Green.</p>
<p>This town on the Wisconsin River looks average, but it isn't. When
people do things here, they do them in a big way.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Frank Lloyd Wright used 600 acres of valley as a laboratory for his
ideas about organic architecture, and visitors can see buildings that
range from an 1886 family chapel that Wright built as an 18-year-old to
a schoolhouse built three years before his death in 1959.</p>
<p>Cognoscenti from around the world come to see Wright's elegant designs.
But they're vastly outnumbered by those who come to see the gloriously
gaudy House on the Rock, built into a hillside with the same slabs of
golden limestone that Wright so prized.</p>
<p>In a natural amphitheater in the valley, American Players Theatre was
founded in 1980 to perform the classics.</p>
<p>And artists have flocked to Spring Green's hills and valleys, opening
galleries and studios that are stops on the wildly popular Fall Art Tour
in October.</p>
<p>Spring Green is a tourist town in summer, and I'd been assured that
most shops would be open on Memorial Day, my birthday.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_green_general_store.jpg" alt="The Spring Green General Store." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>The nonprofit Bargain Nook would be closed, though, so on the way, my
husband and I stopped at the Bargain Nook in Platteville, which agreed
to give me an early birthday discount.</p>
<p>Thanks to overenthusiastic use of the discount, the stores now limit it
to 10 percent of purchase, but I still got a great deal on three pairs
of Land's End shoes, two bathing suits and a cashmere sweater with a
split seam.</p>
<p>We rolled into Spring Green at 5 p.m., and I was surprised to see No
Rules Jewelry &amp; Gallery still open. The good news was, it was open late
because of the crowds attending BobFest down the street.</p>
<p>The bad news was, it would be closed for the holiday, and so would all
the other shops. There went my free bar of fancy soap from Panacea.</p>
<p>Jewelry designer Maya Madden felt bad about the bum steer, but she
shrugged it off.</p>
<p>&quot;That's just the kind of town this is,&quot; she said. &quot;If there's
people, we're open. If not, we're closed.&quot; Instead of a 40 percent
discount on earrings-I don't have pierced ears-she gave me a
free Gail Ambrosius truffle for my birthday.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_green_bobfest_singer.jpg" alt="A Dylan impersonator sings at BobFest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>That worked out well for her, since I then bought another four truffles
and a $50 amber and brushed-silver pendant. And if we decided to ride
bikes instead of shop on my birthday, Madden said, we could borrow hers.</p>
<p>Down the street, in the back yard of the Spring Green General Store, a
happy crowd was celebrating Bob Dylan's birthday at BobFest.</p>
<p>The headliner was a band led by Marty L'Herault, a musician from nearby
Arena who gave an uncanny impersonation of Dylan, right down to the
frizzy hair and raspy voice.</p>
<p>&quot;BobFest is like going back to the late '60s and early '70s,&quot; said
Sarah Thompson, a Barneveld, Wis., teacher who lived in Madison during
its halcyon days. &quot;In fact, I think I smell patchouli.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I always smell patchouli in Spring Green,&quot; said Sara L'Herault of
Verona Wis., Marty's sister-in-law.</p>
<p>Started in 1978, the Spring Green General Store still caters to the
tie-dyed set, though that's more affluent these days.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I got my free birthday entree-a square of Roberto's Frito Pie,
nearly the only food left -and ate it on the screened porch with a
brownie and a wonderfully hoppy bottle of Kiss the Lips IPA from Lake
Louie Brewing in Arena.</p>
<p>Owner Todd Miller said he and a couple of local &quot;Dylanologists&quot;
started the fest in 1997 as something goofy to do on the holiday
weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;Every year, people just come; we don't really advertise,&quot; he says.
&quot;The musicians perform free, and most of them have already asked to
come back next year.&quot;</p>
<p>From town, we drove to the Silver Star B&amp;B, a country inn up in the
hills. We didn't get anything free, but we had a lovely stay; owner
Jean Langer is an artist and once owned a gallery in Madison, and its
log walls are covered with original art.</p>
<p>We showed up at House on the Rock right after breakfast, and I collected
my free birthday ticket for all three parts of the self-guided tour. We
weren't sure we wanted to see all three parts, but it's hard to turn
down something that's free. My husband pointed at the packets of
aspirin in a vending machine near the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Look, they've got the headache medication right at the start,&quot; he
said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_green_silver_star.jpg" alt="The Silver Star Inn in Spring Green, Wis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

photographer.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>House on the Rock is like a train wreck-looking won't make you feel
good, but it's impossible to turn away.</p>
<p>We walked and walked and walked through endless passageways and rooms,
wondering how one man could assemble so much stuff in the days before
eBay. Perhaps a thousand weekends of garage sales? But more importantly,
why?</p>
<p>An attendant named Phil said we could credit-or blame-tourists,
who prompted Alex Jordan to expand his 1946 &quot;Japanese house&quot; that
jutted over the valley, reportedly to annoy the abrasive Frank Lloyd
Wright.</p>
<p>&quot;The tourists came and wanted to see it, so he charged them 50 cents to
get rid of them,&quot; Phil said. &quot;But that didn't work. So he built
more rooms to give them something to look at.&quot;</p>
<p>After a while, our 2½-mile slog past an endless procession of mechanical
orchestras, dollhouses and model ships began to feel like karmic
retribution for past excess and an admonition for the future: As another
famous architect said, less is more.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We fled to have lunch at the Frank Lloyd Wright Visitor Center's
Riverview Terrace Cafe, where muted classical music was balm to our ears
after the tinny carousel noise at House on the Rock.</p>
<p>Before heading home, we stopped at the Spring Green Culver's for my
free birthday sundae, then at a nearby liquor store to pick up a few
six-packs of Lake Louie, the local beer. Kiss the Lips for sure, but
what else? Fatty Boombalatty Belgian-style ale? Warped Speed Scotch ale?</p>
<p>Proprietor Gayle Wood tried to help, and at the counter, I asked about
her birthday deal, since the store was listed as a participating
business. But she said she'd discontinued it.</p>
<p>&quot;I got tired of people calling and saying, 'What are you going to give
us?' and then, 'Oh, I don't like that,' &quot; Wood said. &quot;But since
you didn't call and didn't worry about it, I'm going to give you
something.&quot;</p>
<p>She handed me a combination bottle opener, corkscrew and knife that was
exactly like the one confiscated from me at the Frankfurt airport. I was
still missing it, and now it had come back to me.</p>
