<h2>In northwest Illinois, this historic village is a favorite destination.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/a/galena_trolley.jpg" alt="Two trolley tours prowl the streets of Galena, Ill." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On trolley tours, tourists learn about the town's history.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the grand scheme of things, Galena, Ill., was destined to be a flash
in the pan.</p>
<p>The flash came from the shiny lead sulfide upon which the town's
fortunes were built in the 1830s, '40s and '50s; galena is the Latin
word for the ore.</p>
<p>It made many people rich, and in the 1850s, Galena, three miles from the
Mississippi, was the busiest port between St. Paul and St. Louis.</p>
<p>The new railroad approached, but the steamboat lines made sure it stayed
away from Galena.</p>
<p>Then the lead market weakened, trade routes shifted and the town's
steep hillsides, which had given up their trees for the smelting
furnaces and their limestone for houses, began to erode into the Galena
River.</p>
<p>By 1910, the river had shrunk so much the steamboats couldn't get
through.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Galena settled into obscurity. But its luster began to return in the
1960s, when people looked around and saw a town that wasn't just old,
but antique.</p>
<p>On Main Street were rows and rows of brick storefronts. High above on
&quot;Quality Hill,&quot; and across the now-puny river, were rows of
Italianate mansions and Queen Annes and Greek Revivals.</p>
<p>Well, everyone's seen nice houses. But what sets Galena's architecture
apart is what's not there: no concrete boxes, no plywood facades,
barely anything built in the 20th century, except a Carnegie library and
the old hilltop high school, now condos. Galena's residents simply
couldn't afford to replace anything.</p>
<p>With prospects so diminished, no one could afford to modernize the
mansions or the old brick storefronts that lined downtown, which
included the leather shop in which Ulysses S. Grant worked before war
broke out.</p>
<p>The town was rediscovered in the 1960s, and antiques dealers moved in.
Mansions and storefronts were restored, though not to an unholy
perfection.</p>
<p>Galena has continued to evolve. Today, the antiques shops largely are
gone, replaced by specialty boutiques and galleries that cater to
tourists from Chicago. Wine tastings in Main Street shops and vineyard
tours in the countryside are in vogue.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/a/galena_bridge.jpg" alt="In Galena, tourists watch a canoe race." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
People watch a canoe race from a bridge over the Galena River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>History is a growth industry: There are two trolley companies, two ghost
tours, a walking tour, kayak tours on the placid Galena River, even a
scooter tour to a country vineyard.</p>
<p>Festivals cram the town with even more visitors than it gets on ordinary
weekends, when crowds jostle on the narrow sidewalks and noise from
packs of Harleys stops conversations.</p>
<p>Along Main Street, fancy shops sell cappuccino, pottery, retro toys,
beads, cookwares and crystal.</p>
<p>The DeSoto House Hotel is in the center of it all, its wrought-iron
balcony hung with red, white and blue bunting in memory of 1856, when
Abraham Lincoln spoke from it, and 1868, when Gen. Ulysses Grant ran his
successful presidential campaign out of the hotel.</p>
<p>Hugging the hillside above downtown is Bench Street, home to inns, the
Galena/Jo Daviess County History Museum and four of the churches whose
white steeples contribute so much to the town's skyline.</p>
<p>The really fine mansions, several of them guest houses, are a huff and a
puff higher, on Prospect Street.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>This historic district is best seen from across the river in pleasant
Grant Park, reached by footbridge. Here is a statue of the great man,
who was not so great in 1860, when, having resigned from the Army, he
came to Galena to work as a clerk in his father's leather shop.</p>
<p>When war broke out, Grant formed a volunteer company of locals and began
drilling them.</p>
<p>Two years later, he was commander-in-chief of the Union Army. In another
two years, he returned to Galena's huzzahs and a house bought for him
by local businessmen.</p>
<p>Today, the Grant Home is open for tours, with almost all of its original
furnishings.</p>
<p>This peaceful part of Galena also contains houses that have a variety of
histories and architectural styles, explained on the trolley tours.</p>
<p>Guides toss out interesting historical tidbits, of which Galena seems to
have a limitless supply: For example, Gen. Grant, who died of throat
cancer, smoked more than 20 foot-long cigars a day and was given 10,000
boxes of cigars by a tobacco company after the war.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/a/galena_cannon.jpg" alt="A cannon in Galena." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Galena's first heyday was before the Civil War, when it was home to
Ulysses S. Grant.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Galena had a short heyday, but the town packed a lot into it. The
characters it produced, including nine Civil War generals and one
accused traitor, provide plenty of grist for ghost tours and cemetery
walks.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, all this history and charm attracts tourists.
Galena's current population is 3,400, but weekend visitors push it back
toward and sometimes past its 1858 peak of 14,000.</p>
<p>May and the first half of June is the best time to visit; in summer and
fall, the streets can be crowded.</p>
<p>Obviously, this old flash in the pan has plenty of flash left.</p>

<p><strong>Accommodations:</strong> For summer and fall
weekends, book far in advance. There are many nice inns, cottages and

the <a href="https://galenabandb.org/">Bed and Breakfast Inns of Galena</a>. There
are also motels, resorts and vacation rentals.</p>
<p>The ideal thing to do is arrive midweek at the visitors center, just
across the river in the old railroad depot, and leaf through its photo
album of inns. Many smaller places have a two-night minimum on peak
weekends.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.greenbriargalena.com/">Greenbriar Country Inn &amp; Suites</a>, a
short walk from downtown, offers a good value and doesn't have a
two-night minimum. The <a href="http://www.desotohouse.com/">DeSoto House Hotel</a>
on Main Street is well-known and convenient.</p>
<p>Up on U.S. 20, the <a href="http://www.theirishcottageboutiquehotel.com/">Irish Cottage Boutique
Hotel</a> has a day spa and
pub with live entertainment. Rooms on the back side are quiet and have a
view.</p>
<p><strong>Dining:</strong> There are many good restaurants
on Main Street, including <a href="http://www.fritzandfrites.com/">Fritz and
Frites</a>, a French-German bistro; <a href="http://www.vinnysgalena.com/">Vinny
Vanucchi's</a>, a long-time Italian
favorite; <a href="http://www.oneelevenmain.com/">One Eleven Main</a>, which
serves an eclectic array of American standards; and <a href="http://www.friedgreen.com/">Fried Green
Tomatoes</a>, which has a large Italian menu.</p>
