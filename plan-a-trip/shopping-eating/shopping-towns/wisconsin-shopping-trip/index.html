<p>Down comforters, to nestle all snug on a bed. Fleece stockings, to wear
with care. Bowlsful of jelly, and a shop full of toys.</p>
<p>These visions were enough to draw six Minnesota women toward the rolling
folds of southwest Wisconsin, holiday lists in hand. Until that trip, my
friends and I never had thought of ourselves as power shoppers.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, I've never done this before,&quot; marveled my friend Mary,
looking on as three of us tried futilely to close the lid of the bulging
car-top carrier. &quot;I've heard about women who do this.&quot;</p>
<p>We came, we saw, we bought-enough to fill every inch of a minivan
and a Yakima Space Booster, too.</p>
<p>Our first stop was LARK Toys, along the Mississippi south of Wabasha.
This nifty little complex is the home of a magnificent hand-carved
carousel, where we hopped atop dragons and flamingos.</p>

<h3>Shopping with the Amish in Cashton</h3>
<p>Watching for eagles, we continued down Minnesota 61 and across the I-90
bridge to Cashton, deep in the coulee country east of La Crosse. Old
Order Amish began moving to these rocky valleys and ridges in 1966. To
supplement their farm incomes, they began selling jellies, candy, quilts
and wood furniture to &quot;the English.&quot;</p>
<p>The tourists, however, had a hard time finding Amish farms on the
winding roads and often asked neighbor Kathy Kuderer for directions. So
Kuderer opened a shop selling Amish goods, and then began to lead tours
of farms owned by Amish friends.</p>
<p>&quot;I try to keep the tours on a very personal, respectful level,&quot; she
says. &quot;I don't want them to feel, 'Here come the tourists, we're on
display.' &quot;</p>
<p>From the first farm, we bought cashew crunch-just butter, sugar and
nuts, but so addictive-from young women in muslin bonnets, toiling
in a toasty-warm kitchen.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mineral_point_high_street_pedestrian.jpg" alt="Shops on High Street in Mineral Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Shops and galleries line High Street in Mineral Point.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At the second, we bought wooden spoons and puzzles carved by a
grandfather of one of the young women, who patiently showed us how they
worked.</p>
<p>At Uriah Herschberger's wood shop, Becky wanted an ingenious
three-in-one child's desk, high chair and rocker, but knew we didn't
have room to carry it home, so she settled for a collapsible wooden
fruit basket.</p>
<p>In one home, a bed was piled with lovely, hand-stitched quilts, but we
took home only quilted potholders, a child's apron and a vivid red rug.</p>
<p>In between stops, Kuderer told us how the Amish make do without such
comforts as electricity, central heat or plumbing, according to the
strict dictates of their order.</p>
<p>&quot;This is how they've chosen to live-'To be in this world, but not
of the world,' &quot; she said. &quot;It's very simple, very plain, very
humble.&quot;</p>
<p>We were running out of time, so we had to bypass Spring Green, where
dozens of artisans have set up shop. In Mineral Point, we stayed at the
Brewery Creek Inn, a renovated 1854 limestone warehouse.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/mineral-point-art-tour/">Bargains in Mineral Point</a></h3>
<p>The next morning, after walks on the Cheese Country State Trail, just
down the street, we hit the Bargain Nook on High Street. It's one of
five non-profit resale shops to which Land's End, based in nearby
Dodgeville, donates its returned catalog goods.</p>
<p>As we started looking, Sue Cimino of Lake Delton, Wis., was finishing
her shopping, and she was flushed with success. Not only had she found
some great deals- lambs-wool sweaters, silk long underwear, a down
coat, clogs, a fleece jacket-but it was her birthday, so she got an
extra discount.</p>
<p>&quot;This is so much fun,&quot; she said, eyes sparkling. &quot;It's the best
birthday present ever. You can't find a better deal in the
universe.&quot;</p>
<p>We filled bags with our buys: a child's parka, sets of women's silk
long underwear, wool-felt clogs. I wanted an enormous $245 rolling
suitcases, $10 with a pull-out handle that didn't work, but my friends
just shook their heads-no room in the van.</p>
<p>And we made a serious dent in our Christmas lists across the street at
the Johnston Gallery, buying hand-dipped candles, earrings, art-glass
coasters. At Brewery Pottery Studio, we bought bowls, trays and low,
patterned vases.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mineral_point_shoppers.jpg" alt="Shopping in Mineral Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Mineral Point is full of interesting shops and galleries, and we wished
we'd had more time to explore them.</p>
<p>After a lunch of Cornish pasties at the Red Rooster CafÃ©, we moved on to
Bargain Nook No. 2 in Darlington, 15 miles south of Mineral Point. While
I bought khakis and fleece socks, Mary ducked into the antiques store
next door and bought a porcelain rice cup to use as a votive.</p>
<p>At the office of Yellowstone Lake State Park, where we stopped to hike,
she bought a half-price T-shirt for her son.</p>
<p>&quot;So have we made a stop where we <em>haven't</em>
bought anything?&quot; Becky asked.</p>
<h3><a href="https://admin.midwestweekend.com/plan_a_trip/history_heritage/ethnic_towns/new_glarus_wisconsin.html">Swiss treats in New Glarus</a></h3>
<p>In the picturesque Swiss town of New Glarus, we stocked up beer from the
New Glarus Brewing Co., which doesn't distribute in Minnesota. The
Belgian Red, made with Door County cherries, was requested by several
husbands.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On Sunday morning, after walks and runs along the Sugar River State
Trail, we bought Swiss pastries at the New Glarus Bakery and German
Advent calendars at the Maple Leaf Cheese and Chocolate Haus, then
headed toward home.</p>
<p>But we had one last stop-the Shoe Box in Black Earth, known not so
much for bargain-basement prices as for its huge variety of sizes and
styles. At 11 a.m. Sunday, every spot in the parking lot was full, and
the store-&quot;Voted Madison's favorite shoe store!&quot;-was
packed.</p>
<p>In our allotted 25 minutes, I managed to find half-price Asics running
shoe. Becky, who wears narrow sizes, found half-price Clarks clogs and
fleece socks.</p>
<p>&quot;I like to have more time to spend in a place like that,&quot; she said
wistfully, as our friends hustled us into the van for the trip back.</p>
<p>At home, gathering up our many purchases, we looked just like bag
ladies. But then, so does St. Nick.</p>
