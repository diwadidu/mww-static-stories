<h2>In this colorful college town, materialism and muckraking co-exist.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_art_fair2.jpg" alt="Shopping at Madison's Art on the Square." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In July, thousands of shoppers come for Art on the Square and Art Off
the Square.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Madison, a visitor is exposed to many messages: Resist corporate
globalization. Fight for social justice. Housing is a RIGHT!</p>
<p>But when I was there one November, no one said anything against
materialism.</p>
<p>Madison — sometimes called the People's Republic of Madison — is so
anti-establishment and anti-corporate that a Starbuck's caused an uproar
when it opened on State Street.</p>
<p>Aside from the Starbucks, and a Gap whose windows often are plastered
with political graffiti, State Street is nearly franchise-free —
meaning it's lined with small, locally owned, one-of-a-kind businesses.</p>
<p>That makes Madison a great place to shop. My consumption —
inconspicuous, I hoped — started in the gift shop next to the Hotel
Ruby Marie, with pint glasses from Wisconsin breweries.</p>
<p>From there, I walked downtown, passing the offices of Progressive
magazine, which has been agitating since it was founded in Madison in
1909; on its windows hung a sign: &quot;Justice, Not Vengeance.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then I rounded Madison's beloved, blindingly white Capitol, topped by a
gilt damsel called Ms. Forward — Forward is the state motto — with
corncobs behind each ear and a badger sitting on her head; her rear end,
notes local smart-aleck Michael Feldman, is the highest point in town.</p>
<p>State Street is one of 16 streets, mostly one-way, that radiate from
Capitol Square and trap unsuspecting tourists like flies in a web. Cars
aren't allowed on State Street, but there's nothing pedestrian about it;
somehow, the flavor of the '60s still wafts from its slightly tatty
storefronts.</p>
<p>At Urban Outfitters, two foreign students were giggling over Jesus
action figures. Near the cult-fiction section at a bookstore, pamphlets
lambasted the World Trade Organization, the media and space weapons.</p>
<p>At a boutique, a glass case held rhinestone tiaras: &quot;The drag queens buy
those,&quot; said the manager. &quot;We actually sell quite a few.&quot;</p>
<p>It also had racks and racks of beaded and sequined party dresses,
snapped up by sorority girls to wear clubbing. Across the street,
Sassafras carried black-leather sheaths and Italian camisoles.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/state_street.jpg" alt="Madison's State Street." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
State Street connects the Capitol and the campus.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At the State Historical Society Museum, I bought inexpensive die-cast
pencil-sharpeners in the shapes of paddleboats and typewriters, but I
coveted the Ojibwe boxes of birchbark and porcupine quills.</p>
<p>At the end of State Street, carts were selling Thai, African, Jamaican,
Greek, Southern and Cuban take-out.</p>
<p>I bought a tray of Thai noodles and ate them on the steps of the campus
library, listening to a man with a wispy white beard play the
&quot;Flintstones&quot; theme on a piccolo and watching students with the
Wisconsin Public Interest Group paint affordable-housing slogans on
plywood.</p>
<p>From State, I drove to Monroe Street, another street of old brick
storefronts filled with shops, galleries and coffeehouses just south of
Camp Randall Stadium.</p>
<p>At Orange Tree Imports, I found tiny glass candy-cane and bonbon
ornaments, chocolate Advent calendars from Germany and classy but
inexpensive cooking utensils.</p>
<p>At Calabash, I bought a painted-glass platter from South Africa. The
shop was filled with African items: a Namibian wood giraffe, stone
carvings from Zimbabwe and pop-can Peugeots fashioned by Soweto
teen-agers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>That evening, a Broadway production of &quot;Les Miserables&quot; was playing to
a sold-out crowd at the Overture Center for the Arts.</p>
<p>I was at the other end of State Street, listening to national folk
artist Utah Phillips — imagine Garrison Keillor as a white-haired,
rail-riding anarchist — tell anecdotes about class struggle and sing
songs with such refrains as &quot;Dump the bosses off your back.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In a mass-market environment, a revolutionary song is any song you
choose to sing yourself,&quot; Phillips said wryly.</p>
<p>I doubted there was a single truly blue-collar worker at the
performance, a benefit for Wisconsin Wetlands Association. The Wobblies
had a table in the lobby, though; the Industrial Workers of the World
may be a footnote in history elsewhere, but they're alive and kicking in
21st century Madison.</p>
<p>The next day, I shopped in earnest. The Winter Art Festival was being
held at Monona Terrace, a convention center first designed by Frank
Lloyd Wright in 1938 and finished in 1997.</p>
<p>With ceiling-to-floor windows overlooking Lake Monona, and a
Jetsons-go-Greek rooftop garden, it's one of Madison's favorite spots.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_monona_terrace.jpg" alt="Monona Terrace in Madison." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Market in winter.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Inside, more than 140 Wisconsin artists were selling their wares; my
prize was a walnut coat rack from Marcus and Penny Neal of Cassville,
Wis.</p>
<p>At Matthias James' pottery booth, Mary Tonti of Milwaukee was buying a
$350 double-glazed jar, &quot;a bargain for the price.&quot; In the afternoon,
she planned to hit Monroe Street, which she'd discovered the previous
day driving around the Arboretum.</p>
<p>&quot;Madison has all these great little shops to stop at,&quot; she said. &quot;I
think it's because of the diversity of the university, all the students
they attract. You've got this great cross-cultural thing going on.&quot;</p>
<p>Then I headed for Middleton, Madison's western suburb. That's the home
of Clasen's European Bakery, which has been making pastries and breads
since 1960.</p>
<p>Its building is modern but its baked goods are Old World —
Linzertortes, apfelkuchen, stollen and Lebkuchen, as well as chocolates,
cookies, cakes and a big tray of blueberry-streusel bars to sample.</p>
<p>I headed home, having dutifully consumed and stocked up on all things
Wisconsin: frozen custard, Clasen's pastries, New Glarus beer. Then, I
spotted a black-and-white spotted building, and a sign: Fresh Cheese
Curds. I was tempted — but only for a minute.</p>
