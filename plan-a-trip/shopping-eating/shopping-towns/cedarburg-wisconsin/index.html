<h2>In southeastern Wisconsin, a historic village has perfected the art of the party.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/e/cedarburg_main_street.jpg" alt="Historic buildings on Cedarburg's Washington Avenue." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When a small town is about as pleasing as can be, what else can it do?</p>
<p>Why, make sure everyone notices, of course.</p>
<p>In 1972, an old Yankee mill town just north of Milwaukee started a Wine
&amp; Harvest Festival. Two years later, it started Winter Festival.</p>
<p>Eight years after that, it started Strawberry Festival. And people
poured into Cedarburg by the thousands.</p>
<p>&quot;It's charming and quaint and sweet and walkable, and when you throw a
festival on top of that, it makes it very irresistible to a lot of
people,&quot; says Kristine Hage, former director of the chamber of
commerce.</p>
<p>But in the early 1970s, the town was not so charming. Many of its
antebellum limestone and cream-brick buildings were in disrepair, and an
oil company wanted to tear down the 1864 stone woolen mill on Cedar
Creek and put in a gas station.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But a preservation-minded mayor refused the permit, and a local couple
bought the mill, started a winery and rented space to shops, calling it
Cedar Creek Settlement.</p>
<p>Another local couple bought an 1853 inn that was being used as a biker
bar and made it an inn again.</p>
<p>Stone and clapboard cottages were restored and used as shops and
studios, and the 1886 Washington House was turned back into an inn,
after years as offices and apartments.</p>
<p>Today, Cedarburg has two districts on the National Register of Historic
Places, each with more than 100 buildings, and it's a favorite weekend
destination, especially for people in Milwaukee and Chicago.</p>
<p>The big mill, with its winery, shops, cafe, blacksmith forge and
galleries, is the hub for celebrations.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/e/cedarburg_strawberry_contest.jpg" alt="A girl gobbles strawberry shortcake in Cedarburg" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In November, the wreaths, ribbons and twinkle lights come out, and Cedar
Creek Settlement begins to celebrate Festive Friday Eves, with live
music, dancers, wine-tasting, cookie-decorating, luminarias and outdoor
cookouts.</p>
<p>&quot;We always come at the holidays,&quot; says Cindy Meckl of Oconomowoc, Wis.
&quot;It's not necessarily what we buy, it's the atmosphere.&quot;</p>
<p>I met Meckl and her family in June when they were in a long line outside
the Cream &amp; Crepe Cafe, always their first stop. They had come to
Cedarburg for their first Strawberry Festival, which draws 40,000 people
to the town of 11,000.</p>
<p>My husband and I got to town early and spent Friday bicycling on the
Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which goes through Cedarburg on a route once
used by the Milwaukee-Sheboygan trolley.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When we got back, Cedarburg's Washington Avenue was lined with artists
hunched over easels, putting final touches on their entries for the
Cedarburg Cultural Center's annual Plein Air Competition.</p>
<p>The historic buildings look good in oil paintings, and Jim Hempel's
featured a woman in a straw hat walking a dog past a flower shop. His
model was Karen Spinti, who grew up nearby and was a first-grader when
the mill was restored.</p>
<p>&quot;It's always been a cute town,&quot; she says. &quot;I'd go into the mill
building, poking around the shops with my sister and mom. It's exactly
as it was when I was 8 or 9 years old, except now there are more coffee
shops.&quot;</p>
<h3>Links to the past</h3>
<p>The influx of admiring tourists sometimes annoys some residents.</p>
<p>&quot;People view Cedarburg as an old-fashioned movie where time has
stopped,&quot; said Debbie Menzel. &quot;I guess because I live here, I don't
see it that way.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/e/cedarburg_mill.jpg" alt="The old woolen mill in Cedarburg." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Cedarburg's grist mill was built in 1855.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But the scenery encourages the illusion. There's the state's last
original covered bridge, in a park north of town.</p>
<p>There's the five-story 1855 Greek Revival grist mill, part of it piled
with bags of feed and seed for birds and pets. There's the 1926 filling
station, built in the style of a Japanese teahouse.</p>
<p>It doesn't look frozen in time. McMansions have popped up close to the
1876 lattice-truss bridge, whose planking is held together with hardwood
pins. The red-roofed filling station is a jewelry store now, and the
gristmill is a microbrewery.</p>
<p>But it's still easy to imagine the town as it was 150 years ago, as we
discovered while sitting over pizza and Silver Creek ale along the
millstream, listening to water rush over the dam and throwing crumbs to
two ducks that had waddled over. Links to the past are everywhere.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At the 1886 Washington House Inn, our high-ceilinged room was named for
John Armbruster, who we knew was a jeweler because we'd admired the
ornate 1884 street clock outside his store, now run by another John
Armbruster.</p>
<p>The elegant but unpretentious inn was our kind of place: In the evening,
we found a plate of chocolate-dipped strawberries in our room, and the
morning buffet included as much freshly squeezed orange juice as we
could drink, plus freshly baked breads, hardboiled eggs, yogurt,
homemade granola and platters of fruit.</p>
<p>Vicky Aitken and Mary Elizabeth O'Hara of St. Louis, Mo., have been
staying at the inn for more than 20 years, since they picked up a
Cedarburg brochure at the Wisconsin border and drove up on a whim.</p>
<p>Now, they come to Cedarburg several times a year-in the summer, for
Aitken's birthday in September and during the holidays.</p>
<p>&quot;We do a lot of shopping, believe me,&quot; Aitken said. &quot;It's a great
walking town, which is really important.&quot;</p>

<h3>All about strawberries</h3>
<p>On the Saturday morning of Strawberry Fesival, white tents had sprouted
up and down Washington Avenue. By 10 a.m., Amy's Candy Kitchen was
packed with people ogling fat caramel apples covered with pecans,
cashews, white chocolate and M&amp;Ms.</p>
<p>Outside the meat market, people stood in line to buy freshly grilled
strawberry brats. Gift shops were packed with shoppers looking at tile
birdhouses, hand-painted martini glasses and beaded purse pins that
read, &quot;I came, I saw, I bought.&quot;</p>
<p>At Cedar Creek Settlement, the winery was filled with people buying
bottles of Strawberry Blush, Settlement Gold and Waterfall Riesling.
Upstairs, shoppers walked narrow hallways past shops displaying pottery,
paintings, vintage wear and antiques.</p>
<p>In the mill's courtyard, contestants were vying to see who could lap up
bowls of strawberry shortcake fastest and blow the biggest bubble of
strawberry gum.</p>
<p>On Washington Avenue, people were downing glasses of Sprecher Strawberry
Hefe Weiss and painting their own strawberry clay pots.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/e/cedarburg_kids_window.jpg" alt="Kids look into a candy store in Cedarburg." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Mostly, the strawberry was a good excuse for a June festival, although
once there was a big strawberry farm outside town.</p>
<p>But it was sold to make room for condos-a familiar story. There are
more condos and subdivisions in nearby towns, plus the franchises,
big-box retailers and strip malls that blight towns everywhere.</p>
<p>Not in Cedarburg, though. They're miraculously absent from Cedarburg.
Beyond the downtown historic district, there are modest homes.</p>
<p>There's a drive-in, a city pool, a castle playground, a Piggly Wiggly.
It looks exactly like-a small town.</p>
<p>The longtime meat market and old-fashioned bakery closed, but they were
replaced by another meat market and another bakery,</p>
<p>It turns out that the same people who worked hard to restore the town
are working hard to keep the town what it is.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/e/cedarburg_bike2.jpg" alt="The Interurban Trail in Cedarburg." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>And Kristine Hage said there will be no runaway development in
Cedarburg.</p>
<p>&quot;The pressure from developers is pretty relentless here, but the
political powers in this town are a force to be reckoned with,&quot; she
said. &quot;There are a lot of people looking out for Cedarburg.&quot;</p>
