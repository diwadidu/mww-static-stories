<h2>When artisans and shopkeepers followed potters into Cambridge, Wis., the former resort village became a magnet for shoppers.</h2>
<p>IMG:RIGHT</p>
<p>When Christmas approaches, people unpack those cute little ceramic villages, arranging the tiny shops and steepled churches on mantels or in windows with strands of white twinkle lights.</p>
<p>But if you don�t have your own miniature village, you can always visit the real thing.</p>
<p>Cambridge, Wis., is not made of ceramics, exactly, but it does owe a lot to pottery.</p>
<p>In 1975, when the country-d�cor fad was gathering steam, Jim and Tina Rowe bought a blacksmith shop in this village of 1,000, in the countryside east of Madison.</p>
<p>They opened an antiques shop and pottery works, saw the prices at which old pieces of salt-glazed pottery were selling and began to make their own crocks and plates with the distinctive blue-and-gray finish, achieved by throwing salt into the flames during firing.</p>
<p>They were a big hit. Today, Rowe Pottery Works is the nation�s largest producer of salt-glazed pottery, and Cambridge is known as the pottery center of the Midwest.</p>
<p>Along with other potters came artisans and shopkeepers, who moved into the brick storefronts of Main Street, which slopes past the village square to Koshkonong Creek and West Side Park.</p>
<p>In winter, ice skaters circle on the park�s rink, and skiers head out along the wooded trail that follows the creek.</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>At Christmas, the town lives up to its motto: ``The best of yesterday and today.�� Pine garlands and white twinkle lights are wrapped around its lampposts and storefronts. During Country Christmas weekend in December, carolers and Dickensian street urchins roam the streets, where visitors ride on horse-drawn wagons. On the porch of the pottery works, Jim Rowe roasts chestnuts.</p>
<p>``This is a piece of Americana I thought you couldn�t capture,�� says Dotti Krieger, who runs the 1893 Cambridge House B&amp;B with her husband, Bill. ``But it�s here, and it�s real. We first came to look at the house during the Dickens Festival at Christmas, and I said to Bill, `Does this start to look like Stepford Wives to you? Is this too good to be true?� ��</p>
<p>When I arrived this summer, after a day of bicycling on the nearby Glacial Drumlin State Trail, I checked in first at the Cambridge House. I had some of the wine, cheese and crackers Dotti had put out, then strolled down Main Street, looking in the windows.</p>
<p>All year round, day-trippers and weekenders come here, mainly to shop.</p>
<p>Then I walked down to the creek and the park, where so many fireflies were flitting around it looked as if the town had already put up its twinkle lights.</p>
<p>Back at the Cambridge House, Bill Krieger told me about the town�s past, when tourists from Illinois came to spend the summer at spring-fed Lake Ripley, also the spot where local boy Ole Evinrude first tested his outboard motor.</p>
<p>The lake at the edge of town still draws summer tourists, and Cambridge still is known as the ``Umbrella City,�� after the striped -canvas beach umbrellas used at the lake and to decorate downtown lampposts.</p>
<p>In the morning, after a run along the creek in Cam-Rock Park and a large breakfast, I walked down Main Street to the shops.</p>
<p>From Melli Chocolates, I went away with a small bag of chocolate-dipped Door County cherries.</p>
<p>then walked across the street to Rowe Pottery Works, which was full of shoppers. Since 1975, it�s ventured into tile, wrought iron and other home d�cor.</p>
<p>It has even sold its own miniature village, with a salt-glazed blacksmith shop, mill house, steepled church, general store and brick schoolhouse, just like the 1906 school the town is turning into a museum and pottery center.</p>
<p>Tina Rowe says she and her husband didn�t notice Cambridge was a cute town when they moved to it; they moved there because the shop they wanted was on a natural-gas line, which they needed for their kiln. She notices now; she has to, as president of the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>ADS:16</p>
<p>&quot;I just love it in the morning after a snow has fallen, when I look down the street and see smoke coming out of the chimneys,�� she says. &quot;It really is charming.��</p>
