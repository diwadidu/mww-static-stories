<h2>The Mall of America is huge, but take your time and you'll find its heart.</h2>

<p>Twin Citians can boast all they want about their quality of life, their
lakes and their urban civility.</p>
<p>But the only thing most people in other states and countries really want
to know about is the Mall of America, and the very interesting fact that
there's no tax on clothing and shoes in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Opened in 1992, the megamall was an instant hit, attracting eager
shoppers from all over the world, most arriving with empty suitcases
they can stuff with deals.</p>
<p>It's the No. 1 attraction in Minnesota-those 10,000 lakes aren't
even in the running-drawing 40 million people every year to its 4.2
million square feet of stores, restaurants and amusements.</p>
<p>This massive bubble in the 'burbs holds more than 520 shops, and
grumblers complain that it's like any other mall, except bigger.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I was one of them until I spent a whole day there. I saw interesting
things, I met interesting people and I ate a lot of free goodies offered
by friendly shopkeepers. Then I had to eat my words.</p>
<p>The last time I'd been to the megamall, I thought I was coming down
with the flu. Turns out it was just the deafening white noise, the heavy
gray air that seemed to press against my eyes and the masses of
shuffling shoppers.</p>
<p>This time, I arrived just after opening on a sunny weekday, as the mall
walkers were making their final rounds. The aroma of freshly brewed
coffee and cinnamon rolls hung in the air, and sunlight seeped in
through the dome over Nickelodeon Universe, the world's largest indoor
theme park.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was that there were plenty of shops you
<em>don't</em> see in every mall, as well as
seasonal carts. I passed a Zubaz cart and offered silent sympathies to
the otherwise attractive female clerk wearing the baggy striped pants;
at the Panda Hats cart, the clerk managed to make his tassled pig hat
look jaunty.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mall_america_pastries.jpg" alt="Pastries at Pardon My French." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The locally owned Pardon My French sells European-style pastries.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Rounding the corner from Bloomingdale's, I saw Stuart Weitzman, Michael
Kors, Hugo Boss, Burberry and Lacoste, a mini-Manhattan. The LEGO store
made me smile-who wouldn't, at the sight of a giant armored knight,
a Spanish explorer and a man rappelling out of a helicopter, all made of
blocks?</p>
<p>Then I came upon a young woman drizzling chocolate onto fresh-raspberry
dessert cups right there in the window of the Godiva shop. Screech!
There was no way I could pass <em>that</em> up, even at $4.83. They were
giving out free peppermint truffles, too.</p>
<p>There's a constantly changing selection of locally owned shops, too. In
a little lane near Nordstrom, I found a locally owned shop with a trove
of exquisite gifts and Christmas ornaments from Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The herd only goes in a circle, so if you follow the herd, you never
find these hidden treasure lanes,&quot; said the owner, who said he and
his neighbors pay less rent to occupy their &quot;butt-up&quot; off the main
route.</p>
<p>He also supplied tips on how to avoid congestion getting into the mall:
&quot;Don't follow the car in front of you,&quot; he said.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When I headed back into the main lane, I had a one-of-a-kind ornament.
And I was actually having a good time.</p>
<p>On the second level, I was greeted by the cartoon character Dora the
Explorer, looming at the side of the Ferris wheel at Nickelodeon
Universe.</p>
<p>This seven-acre thicket of spiraling coaster tracks and rides is a fun
spot, and like thousands of other Twin Cities parents, I've thrown
birthday parties there for my kids. It's not cheap, but you can't
miss.</p>
<p>On the second level, I passed Famous Footwear, Zales Jewelry, Old Navy</p>
<ul>
<li>national brands, ho hum.</li>
</ul>
<p>At that point, the duplicate shops started messing with my sense of
direction, but I was careful and stayed on course. On the third level, I
found Moose Mountain Adventure Golf and shops that cater to a less
upscale crowd-Marshall's, the Dollar Tree, a food court with
McDonald's and Arby's.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mall_america_hats.jpg" alt="Selling hats at a kiosk." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Two Panda Hats carts sell fuzzy animals for the head.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But I found my way to a gelato cafe, where an adorable young man handed
me samples as fast as I could eat them-banana toffee, hazelnut,
amarena black cherry, pink lemonade, orange tangerine.</p>
<p>At an imports shop, I picked up a $75 gingerbread Advent calendar from
Nuremberg, Germany, for $15. &quot;You got the deal of the day,&quot; the
pleasant owner said.</p>
<p>Then I had no more arm space on which to hang bags, so I made my way
back to the first level and Kiehl's, which was giving away almond-cake
lollipops covered with white chocolate and a tiny dark-chocolate
mustache. They were delicious.</p>
<p>I stopped to snap a photo of the jaunty young man in the pig hat, who
turned out to be an Israeli college graduate who had come from New York
with the hat cart, and we had a fun chat about the shopping habits of
American consumers.</p>
<p>Many people who come to the Mall of America praise the people-watching;
I didn't see anything notable about the shoppers, but the people who
work there are really interesting. They also seemed to be on top of
their game, competent as well as friendly; it was a pleasant change from
shopping in most other places.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>My last stop was the Rotunda, where chairs were being set up for that
evening's free concert. This is Minnesota's town square, the place
where celebrities can make a splash.</p>
<p>I spent more than six hours at the mall, and I had a great time. It's
got people-watching, for sure. It's got great shopping and sightseeing.
All you have to bring is the right attitude.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: The Mall of America</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : It's in the southern Minneapolis suburb of
Bloomington, just southwest of the airport, at the southeast corner of
Minnesota 77, or Cedar Avenue, and Interstate 494/Minnesota 5.</p>
<p>Most people take the Lindau Lane exit from 77; if you want to avoid
congestion on weekends, take the Killebrew Drive exit.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mall_america_legos.jpg" alt="Giant figures made of Legos." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The mall is connected to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and
downtown Minneapolis by the <a href="http://metrotransit.org/light-rail.aspx">Blue Line/Hiawatha light-rail
train</a>, which runs frequently
to and from the Transit Station on the lower level of the East parking
ramp.</p>
<p>It's a 12-minute ride from the airport and 35 minutes from Nicollet
Mall in downtown Minneapolis.</p>
<p><em>Parking</em> : It's free, and most spaces are in ramps. On busy weekends,
it's fastest to drive straight to the top level of the ramp. Be sure to
remember where you parked.</p>
<p><em>Getting around</em> : Wheelchairs, strollers and shopping carts can be
rented at first-level entrances, which also have rest rooms and
lockers.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : If you don't mind crowds, go on weekends, when there's
more going on and lots of people-watching.</p>
<p>Otherwise, go on early in the day on weekdays, when salespeople have
more time for you and there's not so much white noise and hubbub.</p>
<p>If you find giant malls oppressive, go on a sunny day, when natural
light shines in through skylights.</p>
<p><em>What to know</em> : From 4 p.m. through close on Friday and Saturdays,
youths under 16 must be escorted at all times by an adult age 21 or
over, and adults 21 or younger may be asked to show a photo I.D.</p>
<p><a href="http://mallofamerica.com/events/">Events</a> : Celebrities frequently sign
books, launch products or perform in the Rotunda, on the East side of
the first level.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.greatwolf.com/minnesota">Great Wolf Lodge</a> with an indoor
water park is next to the mall. It has a wave pool, lazy river, raft
ride, tube slides, ropes course, Magiquest game and bowling alley.</p>

<p><a href="http://mallofamerica.com/dining/dining-guide">Dining</a> : There are
dozens of snack and fast-food joints plus 20 restaurants, many of them
good but rarely listed as among the best in the Twin Cities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mallofamerica.com/visit/hotels">Accommodations</a> : There are
dozens of nearby hotels, nearly all offering free shuttles to the mall.
