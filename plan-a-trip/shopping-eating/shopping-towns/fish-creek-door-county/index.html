<p>Few tourist towns are more blessed than Fish Creek.</p>
<p>It's known as Door County's shopping town, and if people think that's
too much of a good thing — well, they're in the minority, judging by
throngs on the streets.</p>
<p>It's also the gateway to the wildly popular Peninsula State Park. This
big park is more like a resort, with a beach, boat rentals, playgrounds,
tennis court and golf course, plus a theater, lighthouse, bike trails
and one of the state's best-known hiking trails.</p>
<p>The town itself is both historic and adorable. A photograph of it, taken
from the park's Shore Road, illustrated a 1969 story in National
Geographic that is credited with kick-starting the modern era of tourism
on the peninsula.</p>
<p>Loggers and fishermen were the first settlers in Fish Creek, as they
were on the rest of the peninsula. But by the turn of the century, it
had become a resort town, and much of it now is a historic district.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Some tourists don't notice that Door County is made up of a series of
towns. It can be hard to tell, especially on the Green Bay side of the
peninsula, because of the non-stop stream of ice-cream parlors,
wineries, gift shops, bistros and inns.</p>
<p>All of the towns also have lovely beaches and parks. But each town has a
different personality, and each has attractions that set it apart from
the others.</p>
<p>So . . . what makes Fish Creek special?</p>
<h3>The park</h3>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/peninsula/">Peninsula State Park</a>
occupies the helmet-shaped point that separates Fish Creek from Ephraim,
and it has two bays of its own. Nicolet Beach occupies the most
protected one and often is cited as one of Wisconsin's best beaches.</p>
<p>From the 10-mile Sunset Bike Route, you can stop to tour the 1868 <a href="https://doorcountyhistoricalsociety.org/eagle-bluff-light-station/">Eagle
Bluff
Lighthouse</a>, Nicolet Beach and the nature center.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/door_county_view.jpg" alt="The view from Eagle Bluff." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Peninsula State Park, there's a panoramic view of Green Bay from
Eagle Tower.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The trail is finely crushed limestone, and you can ride onto it from
Fish Creek, along Shore Road. There are bike rentals near the park
entrance and also at the park concession at Nicolet Beach.</p>
<p>From the two-mile Eagle Trail loop, you can scale Eagle Tower for a view
of Eagle Harbor and Ephraim. It's a beautiful walk, past springs and
limestone outcroppings.</p>
<p>Needless to say, campsites are coveted in this park, which is the
state's most popular camping destination. For weekends,
<a href="https://wisconsin.goingtocamp.com">reserve</a> exactly 11 months in
advance.</p>
<h3>The theaters</h3>
<p>If you're not from Wisconsin, you can learn a whole about its culture
and lingo by watching the plays at <a href="http://www.northernskytheater.com/">Northern Sky
Theater</a>.</p>
<p>The professional troupe performs in an amphitheater in Peninsula State
Park and is best known for its hilarious plays about lovable Wisconsin
doofuses: &quot;Guys on Ice,&quot; &quot;Packers Fans From Outer Space,&quot;
&quot;Lumberjacks in Love.&quot;</p>
<p>South of Fish Creek, on the shores of Green Bay, the <a href="http://www.peninsulaplayers.com/">Peninsula
Players</a> is the nation's oldest
professional resident summer theater.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/i/fish_creek_guysonice5.jpg" alt="
Jeffrey Herbst and Doug Mancheski star in "Guys on Ice.
" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Len Villano</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It put on its first plays in 1935 in the back yard of a Fish Creek motel
and now performs in an open-sided pavilion on the edge of a twinkle-lit
cedar forest.</p>
<h3>The auditorium</h3>
<p>For a town of 1,000, Fish Creek attracts a lot of big-name performers
— Ziggy Marley, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, the Indigo Girls — thanks
to the <a href="http://www.dcauditorium.org">Door Community Auditorium</a>.</p>
<p>It's also the home of the classical <a href="http://www.musicfestival.com/">Peninsula Music
Festival</a> for three weeks in August, and
in September and October, it hosts <a href="http://www.northernskytheater.com/">Northern Sky
Theater</a> plays.</p>
<h3>The drive-in</h3>
<p>In a wooded setting on the hill between Fish Creek and Ephraim, the
<a href="http://www.doorcountydrivein.com/">Skyway Drive-In</a> is a throwback to a
simpler time.</p>
<p>It's been showing double features of first-run movies since 1950.
There's a snack bar, too, serving foot-long hot dogs, pizza and popcorn
with real butter.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>The art school</h3>
<p>On a 10-acre campus in Fish Creek, the <a href="http://www.peninsulaartschool.com/">Peninsula School of
Art</a> offers workshops year-round, in
ceramics, jewelry-making, paper-making, photography and especially
painting.</p>
<p>Its Guenzel Gallery and gardens are open Monday through Saturday. The
school also offers lectures and free Family Art Days.</p>
<p>For more casual artists, the <a href="http://www.handsonartstudio.com/">Hands On Art
Studio</a> offers studio space and art
materials, no reservations needed. Make your own jewelry, glaze a bowl,
fuse some glass or weld metal into anything you want.</p>
<h3>The historic district</h3>
<p>In 1896, German immigrant Dr. Herman Welcker had been in Milwaukee only
a few years when he fell in love with Fish Creek. He moved his wife and
daughter there and built the Henriette Hotel, then cottages.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/i/fish_creek_shops.jpg" alt="Shops in Fish Creek." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Fish Creek is known for its many gift shops.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In 1907, he moved the Lumberman's Hotel across frozen Green Bay from
Marinette and named it Welcker's Casino, for the basement gaming tables
he provided for men.</p>
<p>The Henriette eventually became the White Gull Inn, and Welcker's
Casino is the Whistling Swan.</p>
<p>The shops of nearby Founder's Square also are part of the district. It
includes the original cabin of town founder Asa Thorp, who also ran a
summer resort.</p>
<h3>The French toast</h3>
<p>Few B&amp;Bs have gotten more mileage out of an award than the White Gull
Inn, whose cherry-stuffed French toast was proclaimed Best Breakfast in
America by the show &quot;Good Morning America.&quot;</p>
<p>Breakfast is open to the public as well as guests, so you get to try it,
too.</p>
<h3>The winter festival</h3>
<p>In early February, things get so wild at Fish Creek's Winterfest that
people start throwing things — toilet seats, bicycles, pie tins.</p>
<p>There's also an ugly-sweater contest, snowshoe dancing and, more
conventionally, ice carving and a candlelight ski.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/i/fish_creek_custard.jpg" alt="Not Licked Yet Frozen Custard in Fish Creek." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
