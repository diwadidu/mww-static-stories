<h2>In southwest Wisconsin, artists and shoppers alike are drawn to a lovely village.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mineral_point_high_street_pedestrian.jpg" alt="Shops on High Street in Mineral Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Since its earliest days, the people of Mineral Point have created beauty
out of nothing.</p>
<p>Lead first drew eager frontiersmen, who often lived in the &quot;badger
holes&quot; they dug in their search for &quot;mineral.&quot;</p>
<p>The territory later became known as the badger state, and the town
became Mineral Point, the nucleus around which Wisconsin developed.</p>
<p>In the early 1830s, skilled miners began arriving from Cornwall, on the
rocky western tip of England.</p>
<p>They also were expert stonemasons, and they chipped blocks of golden
limestone out of the ground and fashioned handsome little cottages that
resembled those of their homeland.</p>
<p>With time, mining waned, and the stone cottages began to crumble. In
1934, a chance meeting of Mineral Point native Robert Neal and Edgar
Hellum, who had come to buy scrap wood from the cottages, resulted in
what many thought a crackpot decision.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The two decided to restore a cottage on Shake Rag Street, named for the
dishrags the wives supposedly waved to tell miners up on Merry Christmas
Mine hill their dinner was ready.</p>
<p>To finance their project, the partners began serving tea, saffron cake
and clotted cream to curious visitors.</p>
<p>They added Cornish pasties-meat, potatoes and onions enclosed in a
flaky crust-and soon stories about the quaint little restaurant with
the grapevine-draped privy were appearing in Gourmet magazine and the
Saturday Evening Post.</p>
<p>Neal and Hellum called it Pendarvis House, after an estate in Cornwall.</p>
<h3>Powered by pasties</h3>
<p>In 1939, the first artists moved to the town. Ava Fernekes made clay
sculptures, her husband Max drew Mineral Point's stone cottages in
crayon and watercolors, and both became friends with Neal and Hellum,
who fed the often-hungry artists on leftovers from the restaurant.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mineral_point_dog.jpg" alt="The pointer in Mineral Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;They were the foundations, and then people started coming in,&quot; says
potter Diana Johnston, who lives and works with her husband, Tom, in a
huge stone 1850 brewery on the edge of town.</p>
<p>&quot;Once there was a nucleus, it just grew and grew from there. Now
artists come, and they have a ready market for their work. So it keeps
going, and it just keeps getting nicer.&quot;</p>
<p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation named Mineral Point one of
its Distinctive Destinations, calling it &quot;an architectural treasure
trove.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, studios and galleries sit alongside hardware stores, bars and
doctor's offices along High Street, which veers down a steep hill toward
Shake Rag and Brewery Creek, where lead first was found.</p>
<p>Jail Alley runs behind it, lined by old-fashioned street lamps. Both
streets are lined with a variety of architectural styles and filled with
history.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's the 1871 Gundry &amp; Gray building, whose Cornish proprietor ran a
department store until 1938 and was Neal and Hellum's earliest patron.
There's a deli there now, but over it juts the store's original
cast-zinc symbol, a hunting dog that's the mascot for the high-school
teams, the Pointers.</p>
<p>There's the 1849 brick building of Cadwallader Washburn, who in 1871
became the second Mineral Point resident to be elected governor of
Wisconsin.</p>
<p>By then, he'd already built a flour mill in Minneapolis and later
founded the Washburn-Crosby Co., a Minneapolis milling giant that
spawned WCCO Radio and later became General Mills.</p>
<p>And there's the humble 1849 stone miner's cottage that became the home
of Bob Neal, who had spent time in New York and London yet never felt
the need to venture beyond the beautifully landscaped grounds of
Pendarvis.</p>
<p>In 1970, he and Hellum retired and arranged for the Wisconsin Historical
Society to buy the complex, which it now runs as a state historic site.
In 1971, Mineral Point became Wisconsin's first historic district on the
National Register of Historic Places.</p>

<h3>An eye for potential</h3>
<p>The artists have continued their work, restoring Mineral Point's
buildings. Because they were so small, and often in such bad shape, the
artists were able to buy them, renovate them and stay put.</p>
<p>The lovely buildings bring even more people to Mineral Point. It was
mobbed with shoppers when I attended the annual Fall Art Tour, when
artists open their studios.</p>
<p>Carole Spelic, who makes vessels that look like marble but actually are
a sophisticated papier-mache, said she sometimes sells out during the
tour.</p>
<p>Sure enough, right after her Green Lantern Gallery opened, Linda
Friedman of Chicago came in and nabbed a $200 tiger-striped vessel.
Meanwhile, Friedman's mother, Joan, was looking raptly at the buildings.</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't know about Mineral Point; we were just going to the
different towns on the art tour,&quot; said Joan Friedman, who trains
docents for the Chicago Architecture Foundation. &quot;I'm just
flabbergasted. It's so interesting.&quot;</p>
<p>Just up the street, shoppers crowded into Johnston Gallery, which
carries beautiful art glass, jewelry, handbags and carved wood in
addition to the Johnstons' pottery, the most popular of which bear
patterns made with lace, rope, lefse rollers and hardtack rolling pins.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mineral_point_gallery.jpg" alt="A gallery in Mineral Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

building.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Down on Commerce Street,Â  potter Harriet Story was showing off her
building and her kiln, the fifth she's built herself.</p>
<p>Judith Sutcliffe and Sandra Scott had opened their Longbranch folk-art
gallery just the day before, in a former engine-repair garage that a
still-dazed Sutcliffe said was &quot;the ugliest building in town.&quot;</p>
<p>But shoppers were raving about the painted concrete floor, wildly uneven
but adorned with reverse stencils of fall leaves, and the tall glass
windows, installed where trucks once drove into the shop.</p>
<h3>Art begets art</h3>
<p>As it turned out, Longbranch was only the beginning for the two
newcomers.</p>
<p>Two years later, when they were hosting the annual Woodlanders gathering
of rustic-furniture makers at Shake Rag Alley, a complex of historic
stone cottages and cabins that housed shops, they found out it was to be
sold for a private vacation home.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In six weeks, they raised $100,000 from the community, bought the
complex and started the Shake Rag Alley Center for the Arts, now run by
a board.</p>
<p>Workshops are held year-round, and eventually, the center opened the
Alley Stage, an outdoor summer theater in an old quarry on the grounds.</p>
<p>Like Mineral Point's famous buildings, much of its best art comes
straight out of the earth, from stone, clay and sticks.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why the town has such a lack of pretension-it's
still walking in the dusty footprints of Neal, an aesthete who spent
much of his life rolling pasty crust, and Hellum, a graduate of the
Chicago Art Institute who spent his life hauling rock and digging in the
dirt.</p>
<p>Hellum especially is remembered fondly by today's artists. Shortly
before he died in 2000 at 94, he began to make photo collages and was
featured in an exhibit at his alma mater.</p>
<p>Diana Johnston was one of the townsfolk who, with Hellum, got on a bus
and went to Chicago to see it.</p>
<p>&quot;Edgar Hellum was so full of ideas, and there was so much spinning
around his head, I think because of him Mineral Point is the way it is
today,&quot; she says. &quot;It's not something replicated to look like
something, it <em>is</em> something.&quot;</p>
