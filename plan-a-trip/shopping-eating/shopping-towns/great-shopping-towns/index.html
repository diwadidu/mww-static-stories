<p>Some people may guess that lakes or bicycle trails are the chief
attraction for travelers in the Upper Midwest. Other might say museums,
state parks or stadiums.</p>
<p>Wrong, wrong and wrong. The No. 1 attraction in travel is . . . shops.</p>
<p>Shopping <em>is</em> sightseeing for a lot of
people. On vacation, they shop not as they would at the local mall, but
as if had all the time in the world to browse, stroll and sample.</p>
<p>As, in fact, they do. Legions of weekend hobby shoppers have fueled the
rise of such boutique towns as Stillwater in Minnesota, Cedarburg in
Wisconsin and Galena in Illinois.</p>
<p>Here are more than 20 towns where you'll find great shopping <em>and</em>
sightseeing, ranked from good to greatest, and holiday events in <em>2022</em> .</p>

behemoth <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-mall-america/">Mall of
America</a>, Minnesota's No. 1 tourist attraction. It has more than 520 shops,
mostly national franchises, but there are many one-of-kind stores, too.</p>
<p>And as a bonus, there's an IKEA across the street.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/e/geneva_shops.jpg" alt="Shops in downtown Geneva." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

and Wrigleyville the closest you'll get to shopping in the market
squares of Germany. The <a href="https://oneofakindshowchicago.com/">One of a Kind
Show</a> is at the Merchandise Mart
Dec. 2-4.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-madison/">Madison</a>:</strong> This city is allergic to franchises,
so it's a great place to find the goofy and unusual, especially in the
shops along State Street. Be sure to stop by the gift shop of the Museum
of Contemporary Art.</p>
<p>Monroe Street, just south of Camp Randall, has more shops, many
specializing in imported artisan wares from around the world. And
there's an unusually largeÂ  number of <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/madison-chocolate-shops/">artisan chocolate

<h3>Worth a detour</h3>
<p>I've found some of my favorite things at little shops in towns that are
fun to visit but aren't really &quot;shopping towns.&quot; I make a beeline
for them whenever I'm in the area.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/sheboygan_shopping.jpg" alt="Shopping in downtown Sheboygan." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Just off I-94 between Madison and Milwaukee in <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-glacial-drumlin-trail/">Lake
Mills</a>,</strong> I love the gorgeous Arts and Crafts style vases at <a href="http://www.ephraimpottery.com/">Ephraim Faience
Pottery</a> â€” especially the seconds,
which are 50 percent off.</p>
<p>In southeast Minnesota bluff country, I always stop by the <a href="https://lanesboroarts.org/galleries/">Arts
Galleries</a> in
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Lanesboro</a>,</strong> which carries lovely paintings, pottery and photography by local
artists.</p>
<p>Near Bayfield in
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/book-across-bay/">Washburn</a>, Wis.,</strong> <a href="http://www.chequamegonbooks.com/">Chequamegon Books</a> has an
inviting selection of new and used books that always pulls me in for
longer than I'd plan to spend; it's got an espresso bar, too.</p>
<p>Around Chequamegon Bay in
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/ashland-wisconsin/">Ashland</a>,</strong> I always stop by <a href="http://www.gabrielesgermansweets.com/">Gabriele's German
Sweets</a> to pick up a box of tiny,
handmade European-style chocolates and cookies.</p>
<p>In the southern Minnesota town of <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-ulm-german-heritage/">New
Ulm</a>,</strong> Domeiers German
store is overflowing with blown-glass ornaments, imported delicacies and
the region's best selection of German advent calendars.</p>
<p>On Minnesota's North Shore in <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/grand-marais-minnesota-arts/">Grand
Marais</a>,</strong> I visit <a href="http://joynesdeptstore.com/">Joynes Department Store and Ben
Franklin</a> year-round for warm clothes,
especially socks, slippers, boots and hats.</p>
<p>If you want a rabbit-lined ear-flap cap that will make you look like
Marge in &quot;Fargo,&quot; this is the place to find it.</p>
