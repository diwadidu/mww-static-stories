<h2>When warm weather arrives, art fairs start to pop up everywhere.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/r/art_fair_duluth.jpg" alt="Woman looking through a bin of images" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A customer browses in a photography booth at the Park Point Art Fair in
Duluth.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We all know what summer means-days at the beach, boat rides,
marshmallow roasts . . . and shopping.</p>
<p>Not at malls but under the little white tents that pop up wherever
there's a festival, on the shores of lakes, in parks and on picturesque
town squares.</p>
<p>That's where the region's most accomplished potters, glass makers,
jewelers, painters, weavers and photographers bring out their wares and
make themselves available to whoever cares to stop-customers,
passersby, admirers.</p>
<p>At Duluth's Park Point Art Fair, set up near the end of the sand spit
that forms Duluth's harbor, Frank Garcia of Duluth cast himself into
the last category. He went from one photographer's booth to another,
looking enviously at beautifully composed portraits of wildlife, flora
and landscapes.</p>
<p>At each booth, he stopped to chat with the artist.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Even if I don't buy, I've seen some beautiful things by the end of
the day,&quot; Garcia said. &quot;They're interesting people who interact with
life in a completely different way.&quot;</p>
<p>For shoppers, it's a golden opportunity to get to know interesting
artists and to see new works by artists they already know.</p>
<p>At Park Point, I was glad to see photographer Jim Gindorff of St. Paul,
because I'd wanted a framed print of his striking &quot;Oak Leaves&quot;' ever
since I'd bought the image on a $4 greeting card at the Northfield
fair two years earlier.</p>
<p>Luckily for Gindorff, most people don't spend that long deliberating
about spending $120.</p>
<p>&quot;I've had people coming through on their way to their cabin in Grand
Marais, and they'll say, 'I'll take this one and this one and that
one,' and I'll think, where do they get their money?&quot; he said. &quot;I
don't try to talk them out of it, though.&quot;</p>
<p>As I walked along, chatting with the artists and collecting postcards of
art I might want to buy someday, a harpist played. Children played on a
giant wood ore boat, and vendors sold gyros and kettle corn.</p>

<p>Nearly every art fair offers food and entertainment, especially those
that are part of a community festival. But each has a different
character.</p>
