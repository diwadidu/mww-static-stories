<h2>For people who want the best in bonbons, this town is a decadent destination.</h2>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>No one knows why Madison is the fine-chocolate capital of the Upper
Midwest.</p>
<p>We do know that Europe played a big role. Gail Ambrosius, who grew up in
Wisconsin's hamburger capital, tasted her first artisanal chocolate on
a high-school field trip to Paris. &quot;And I understood-eating this is
the best thing you can do,&quot; she writes.</p>
<p>Markus Candinas studied chocolate-making in his parents' hometown of
Thun, at the foot of the Swiss Alps. Ton Stam came from the Netherlands
to join the Madison Scouts drum and bugle corps, then started
Chocolaterie Stam.</p>
<p>When we visit Madison, we always go to Clasen's European Bakery,
founded in 1959 by two brothers from Cologne, Germany. But then we
decided to get serious about the chocolateries, too.</p>
<p>Doing a chocolate tour took some fortitude, especially after we got
waylaid at an epic Battle of the Chocolates. And yet we soldiered on.</p>
<p>We'd read about Candinas Chocolatier since 2002, when Consumer Reports
magazine first declared its chocolate one of the nation's best. But we
had never made it to the factory and store in the far suburb of Verona.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Now <em>Candinas</em> has a tiny storefront on Capitol Square, and that was our
first stop. But we were disappointed by the absence of eye candy: There
was just one open box in a glass case. The shop is mainly a place to
pick up prepackaged boxes, the saleswoman told us.</p>
<p>We wanted to pick and choose, so we decided to drive out to Verona.
First, we followed Williamson Street to Atwood Avenue and <em>Gail
Ambrosius</em> .</p>
<p>The Seymour native took up chocolate as a second career and trained in
France, returning to open a small shop next to the funky, 1929 Barrymore
Theatre.</p>
<p>There was plenty of eye candy there: shiny foil-wrapped novelties,
ribboned boxes of toffee, colorfully stamped sea-salt caramels.</p>
<p>The descriptions were even more tantalizing: &quot;Rich amber cognac coasts
along the top of this flavor fusion, finished by the sweet crunch of
Australian baby candied ginger&quot; . . . &quot;The sweet crunch of crushed
candied almond and marzipan melds with the bright citrus zing of chopped
orange peel.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_metcalfes.jpg" alt="Battle of the Chocolates at Metcalfe's Market." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

into samples.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The shop was packed, but we elbowed our way to the canister of free hot
chocolate and then the glass cases, where we picked out a Cointreau, two
raspberry truffles and a Machu Picchu from the Adventurous Collection.
On the way out, we got a free jasmine truffle as a bonus.</p>
<p>The <em>Chocolaterian Cafe</em> is just down the street, with pastries, tarts
and bars made onsite in a glass-walled kitchen.</p>
<p>From there, we headed south on U.S. 151 to the Beltline and Verona,
where Markus Candinas makes his acclaimed truffles.</p>
<h3>The perfect piece of chocolate</h3>
<p>As soon as we walked through a door adorned with a giant, brushed-steel
&quot;C,&quot; a woman appeared and offered us a hazelnut truffle on a white
tray. Candinas' mother, Margrit, helps out during busy season.</p>
<p>&quot;They are exactly like the chocolates in Switzerland,&quot; she said of
her son's truffles. &quot;He uses just butter and cream; the only difference
is he cannot put in as much alcohol here. Other than that, he is doing
it just the same.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They should be eaten within 10 days, she said, which is what you want to
hear when you buy fine chocolate: If it lasts much longer than that, it
likely contains preservatives.</p>
<p>When another customer came in, we also got half of her sample, a
raspberry truffle that was without doubt the best I'd ever had: pure
essence of berry in a light, creamy ganache enclosed by a delicate
dark-chocolate couverture.</p>
<p>That's how Candinas became a favorite of Consumer Reports. His truffles
are very expensive if you're used to Hershey's, but when you buy a box
of 16, they are less than $2 a piece, a bargain for such high quality.</p>
<p>From Verona, we headed north on U.S. 151 to Midvale Boulevard and
<em>Metcalfe's Market</em> in Hilldale Shopping Center. It was holding a
Battle of the Chocolates, with employees chopping up samples of
chocolates from around the world as fast as people could eat them.</p>
<h3>Too much of a good thing?</h3>
<p>There were 50 kinds of chocolate heaped on a table. As we circled it, we
tried Baci hazelnut kisses, Jacquot truffles and salted toffee caramels
from Godiva. There were bars from Perugina, Chocolove, Wild Boar,
Divine, Valor, Sulpice, Rausch and Lindt.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/v/e/verona_candinas.jpg" alt="Candinas chocolates in Madison." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Candinas chocolates are considered among the nation's best.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When you bought three, you got one free-so we walked out with two
heavy bags full of chocolate that cost only a little less than our
dainty box from Candinas.</p>
<p>We had a blast tasting all those bars, though we soon started to feel
queasy. So at <em>Infusion Chocolates</em> , we let our eyes do the feasting
while we drank a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>The shop's exquisitely molded pieces look like jewels, with color that
looked airbrushed onto their gleaming shells.</p>
<p>&quot;These chocolates don't look as if they're made to be eaten,&quot; we
heard a little boy tell his father.</p>
<p>But they are, and they're good (as we discovered later, when our
appetite returned). We bought a piece with passionfruit and mango purees
blended into liquid caramel and one with Framboise liqueur in a
dark-chocolate ganache.</p>
<p>A passionfruit-vanilla piece made with Malibu rum was best, with a
bright citrus tang. Other pieces boasted the flavors of Wisconsin:
Hook's blue cheese, Kickapoo Gold maple syrup, Nueske's
applewood-smoked bacon.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From Infusion, we headed west to <em>Clasen's European Bakery</em> , where we
chose from vast expanses of chocolate domino petit-fours, marzipan
fruits, many kinds of gingerbread, almond spekulatius, cinnamon stars
and kipferl, hazelnut shortbread crescents tossed in vanilla sugar.</p>
<p>We inspected the life-size gingerbread house, the European cream tortes
and trays of giant American-sized truffles, which didn't tempt us. And
we sampled: two kinds of crumb coffee cake, &quot;elf bite&quot; cookies and
Heidesand shortbread.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, we'd had too much sugar for our own good. When
we walked by the Kilwin's on State Street, the fragrant wave of caramel
that enveloped us turned our stomachs.</p>
<p>The problem with going on a chocolate tour in Madison is that there's
only so much you can try, because eyes always are bigger than stomachs.
Luckily, all the chocolatiers sell their wares to go.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Chocolate tour of Madison</h3>
<p><em>Getting around</em> : The shops are scattered around town, so you'll need
a car to reach them all.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_ambrosius.jpg" alt="Gail Ambrosius Chocolatier in Madison." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Avenue.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>However, Gail Ambrosius and the Chocolaterian Cafe are right off the
northern section of the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/capcity/">Capital City State
Trail</a>, and Candinas is
just south of the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/militaryridge/">Military Ridge State
Trail</a>, so you could
make a chocolate run on your bike.</p>
<p><em>Cost</em> : The going rate for a single piece of fine chocolate is about
$2. Boxes are a better value.</p>
<p><em>Planning a trip</em> : For more, see our <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/madison/">Madison
stories</a>. If you come in summer,
bring a cooler in which to store your chocolate.</p>
