Pastries at Orso's in Old Town cap one food tour.

<p>Chicago has come a long way since it was hog butcher to the world.</p>
<p>There was nothing very appetizing about early Chicago. The factories and
slaughterhouses that made it grow also made it stink. Rotting carcasses
made the Chicago River bubble; a glass of water came with a side of
cholera.</p>
<p>But the city grew up. The immigrants who packed its meat, dug its
waterways and built its railroads moved on and were replaced by new
immigrants, who settled in places that became known as Little Italy,
Andersonville, Polish Village, Ukrainian Village, Chinatown, Greek Town
and Pilsen.</p>
<p>It remained a meat-and-potatoes town, city of big shoulders and big
bellies. But it also became a city of neighborhoods, a source of samosas,
dim sum and quesadillas.</p>
<p>Chicago is always reinventing itself. From its gritty origins, it became
a 20th century Oz, the stage on which American architectural aesthetics
evolved.</p>
<p>Now it's a people magnet, too, drawing tourists from around the world
as well as suburbanites, fascinated by their suddenly charismatic city.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Festive crowds mass night and day on the Magnificent Mile, at Navy Pier
and especially in Millennium Park, where they gaze, mesmerized, at their
reflections in a 110-ton stainless-steel bean.</p>
<p>But Chicago's heart and stomach still are in its
<a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/ethnic-chicago/">neighborhoods</a>,
traditional home of strivers.</p>
<p>They're easy enough to visit on the El, on the subway or by bus; I did
that a few years ago and had a great time eating my way through the East
Indian enclave of Devon Avenue, the remnants of Swedish Andersonville
and bustling Chinatown.</p>
<p>But there was an even easier way to explore Chicago's neighborhoods.</p>
<p>For 15 years, the city showed off its many ethnic enclaves on the
Chicago Neighborhood Tours. They became very popular, growing from five
people in a van to 45 people in a luxury motorcoach, listening to a
guide while lumbering down shady streets lined with painted Victorians
and brownstones.</p>
<p>There were tours of all the neighborhoods, even the cemeteries, and many
included lunch stops. But the most popular tour, of course, was all
about eating.</p>
<h3>Omnivores on the prowl</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_shoppers.jpg" alt="Shopping in Chicago's Old Town neighborhood." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Fudge Pot in the Old Town neighborhood of Lincoln Park was a stop on
the tour.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was the Taste of the Neighborhoods Tour, led by a lively tai-chi
teacher named Evelyn Thompson who seemed to know everything about every
cuisine.</p>
<p>One year, we went on it. As we rolled along Lake Shore Drive, she told
us about our first meal — &quot;We see so many Mexican restaurants, we
forget they're really ethnic restaurants&quot; — and our first
neighborhood.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to Belmont, so any of you who want to get a tattoo today,
be my guest,&quot; she said. &quot;Any of you ladies or men want a leather thong
or nipple pincers, whatever you want, be my guest.&quot;</p>
<p>The Mexican food we know, Thompson said, developed after the Spaniards
brought cows, which supplied milk for cheese, and pigs, which provided
lard for frying. Before that, the indigenous people subsisted on roasted
corn, pumpkin and domestic animals, such as rabbits, turkeys and dogs.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't have a choice, you have to take what the area provides,&quot;
she said. &quot;Whenever I'd see one of those little Chihuahua dogs, I'd
think, 'This would really fit on a skewer,' and I was right.&quot;</p>
<p>At Mi Tierra restaurant on Belmont Avenue, a friendly place with a
folksy decor one of the group called &quot;Barbie's castle,&quot; we filled
plates with chimichangas, quesadillas and chicken in mole sauce. There
are as many kinds of moles as cooks, Thompson said, but it's usually made with
ground nuts, spices, lard, fruit and a bit of bitter chocolate.</p>
<p>&quot;Supposedly it was the nuns who made it popular, but who knows,&quot; she
said.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The waiters kept plying us with pitchers of Pepsi and more chips, but I
tried to pace myself.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of these restaurants are so proud to have a big group like this,
they just heap on more and more,&quot; said Donna Lenfest, a
downtown-Chicago resident who was sitting next to me and was on her
fifth tasting trip. &quot;There was one Turkish restaurant where I think we
stayed a lot longer than the tour guides meant to.&quot;</p>
<p>After eating, we had a few minutes left to &quot;walk on the wild side,&quot; as
Thompson put it, though it didn't look too wild. Marilyn DeGraff, who
said she lived a few blocks away, explained.</p>
<p>&quot;They call it Boys Town,&quot; she said with a giggle. &quot;You know, where
boys go two by two. It gets pretty busy at night, you could say that.&quot;</p>
<p>Back on the bus, tour coordinator Cesar Sanchez talked about the next
stop in Albany Park, where nearly half the local population was born in
another country.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been trying to do Korea for two years, and you have no idea how
hard it is to communicate in Korean,&quot; said Sanchez, who chooses the
stops. &quot;But we finally made it. This is becoming like a new
neighborhood; they're calling it Korea Town.&quot;</p>
<p>We were heading for &quot;grocery-store heaven,&quot; Thompson said. Egyptians
live in the area, Bosnians settled nearby, and Greeks moved in when the
expressway went through Greek Town.</p>

The Old Town neighborhood is not far from the Gold Coast.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Out of the window, I spotted Hellas Bakery, Huaraches restaurant,
Restaurant Sarajevo and Tikim Restaurant — tikim meaning &quot;taste&quot; in
Tagalog, the main language of the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Lots of little dishes</h3>
<p>Our destination was Kangnam, a Korean restaurant in a strip mall on
Kedzie Street. Traditional Korean cuisine, Thompson said, relies on
soups and fermented vegetables, both good to eat during cold winters
that are much like ours.</p>
<p>Like the Chinese, Koreans claim to have
invented pasta, and they use many grains, even to make tea.</p>
<p>&quot;Their diet has been called the perfect diet, 70 percent carbs, 13
percent fat, 14 to 17 percent protein,&quot; she said. &quot;They're a hardy
people, and their diet reflects it.&quot;</p>
<p>As we sat down, small grills were placed in holes in the table and thin
strips of marinated beef placed on them to cook. Then, the dishes
started coming: first a simple salad, then fried vegetable and squid
pancakes, pork dumplings and a plate of fried seaweed — &quot;like potato
chips,&quot; Thompson said.</p>
<p>There were ribbonlike curls of blanched scallions, steamed spinach
tossed with sesame seeds, a white sweet-potato salad and raw fish with a
kind of chutney. When I reached for the fish, tour veteran Marilyn
Guest, who lives in the Jefferson Park neighborhood, nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&quot;That fish is extremely fresh,&quot; she said. &quot;That fish was alive a few
hours ago.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There was pork with eggs, scallions and cellophane noodles and a big
bowl of bi bim bop, a vegetable dish. When the bulgogi was finished
grilling, servers showed us how to wrap it in lettuce leaves with garlic
cloves or eat it with slices of white daikon radish with a dab of chili
paste.</p>
<p>And, of course, there was kim chee, the fermented vegetables for which
Korea is famous. Often buried underground in pots, it's a winter
staple.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't had Korean food in 40 years,&quot; said Carl Lundin from
Munster, Ind. &quot;That was when Uncle Sam took care of us. But I remember
kim chee.&quot;</p>
<p>For dessert, we all got tiny bottles of yogurt that tasted like liquid
sherbet. It was a spectacular meal, and afterward, Thompson complimented
us.</p>
<p>&quot;Things like that, you don't always know what you're eating,&quot; she
said. &quot;You did a really good job to try things like that.&quot;</p>
<h3>Just desserts</h3>
<p>Our next stop was Old Town, an affluent Lincoln Park neighborhood
that's the home of the Second City comedy theater. But 40 years ago,
Thompson said, it was the province of artists and hippies, who helped
preserve its Victorian buildings.</p>
<p>&quot;Those of you who were potted up at the time, maybe you'll recognize
it, maybe you won't,&quot; she said tartly. &quot;Now, instead of pot,
everyone's got a yoga mat; it's still the same principle.&quot;</p>
<p>We were heading for dessert at Orso's, an Italian restaurant off Wells
Street, and Thompson said she hoped we'd get some cannoli or tiramisu.</p>
<p>&quot;Cannoli is Sicilian, fried dough filled with mascarpone and dipped in
pistachio nuts,&quot; she said. &quot;It's Latin for 'reed.' Talk about your
fertility symbols; we live in hope, right?</p>
<p>&quot;Tiramisu is zabaglione with ladyfingers dipped in espresso; it was
given to grooms for a little pick-me-up before the honeymoon; also,
supposedly prostitutes used it for a little pick-me-up, so who knows
what's going to happen when we eat these wonderful desserts.&quot;</p>
<p>I would have had some of everything if Orso's had set out a platter in
their pretty back courtyard. Instead, we each got a plastic cup of
desserts; mine contained a chocolate-dipped strawberry, a macaroon, a
slice of cream cake and a red-glazed carrot cookie.</p>
<p>After a quick stop at the nearby Fudge Pot, we all got back on the bus,
and soon we were back at the Chicago Cultural Center, across from
Millennium Park.</p>
<p>It was a great tour, but it was over way too fast.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a foodie and I love to cook, so this is right up my alley, going
on an ethnic tour,&quot; said Lundin, who said he takes the train into
Chicago every other weekend with his partner, Betty Rudnick, just to eat
and explore. &quot;It's so interesting.&quot;</p>
<p>Chicago no longer has stockyards. But for many, it's still hog heaven.</p>
