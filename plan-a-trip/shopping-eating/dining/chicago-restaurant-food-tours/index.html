<p>Once, Chicago was a meat-and-potatoes town, the City of Broad Shoulders.</p>
<p>Chicagoans still brawl over who has the best deep-dish pizza and
Chicago-style hot dogs, which come with no ketchup but so many
condiments they're &quot;dragged through the garden.&quot;</p>
<p>But these days locals are just as likely to seek out the best macarons
and gelato, and on special occasions, they dine at Michelin-starred
restaurants with avant-garde chefs who are more Jeff Koons than Betty
Crocker.</p>
<p>Chicago today is a foodie town whose residents love food, period. Call
it the City of Broad Hips.</p>
<p>Locals can go wild during Restaurant Week in February. Tourists have to
run around trying to sample even a sliver of the many cafes,
patisseries, ethnic markets and gourmet shops in each neighborhood.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Or, they can join a guided tasting tour and hit six or seven in one
afternoon, as we did one fall.</p>
<p>We chose Chicago Food Planet's tour of the Gold Coast and Old Town
neighborhood, starting at a Jewish deli.</p>
<p>Two blocks from tony Lake Shore Drive condo towers, it held cases of
Eastern European/Jewish comfort food: potato pancakes, latkes, gefilte
fish.</p>
<p>&quot;You hear of Subway and Quizno; they're not the real deal,&quot; said our
personable guide, Lauren McCabe. &quot;This is the real deal.&quot;</p>
<p>She passed around plates of marble rye, homemade sauerkraut, garlicky
peppered pastrami and Russian dressing with chunks of hard-boiled egg
and sweet pickled beets. Piece by piece, we assembled Reuben sandwiches.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to ask for the pastrami, or you'll get corned beef,&quot; McCabe
said. &quot;I think it's a lot better. This is from Vienna Beef — it was
started by two Austro-Hungarian immigrants who made the first
Chicago-style hot dogs at the 1893 World's Fair.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_delightful_pastries.jpg" alt="Pastries in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The tempting wares at Delightful Pastries in Old Town.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Up the street, we walked into Tea Gschwendner, one of only four North
American outposts of the well-known German tea purveyor. Small
stainless-steel bins lined its walls, each filled with exotic tea leaves
from around the world, some costing more than $50 an ounce.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States is the only country where the No. 1 beverage is <em>not</em>
tea,&quot; McCabe noted, with a touch of
disapproval.</p>
<p>First, we sniffed samples of loose leaves.</p>
<p>&quot;Nine out of 10 times, if you like the way it smells, you'll really
like the taste,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>We learned a lot about antioxidants and caffeine as we sampled the bossa
nova, which had strong notes of vanilla and hazelnut, and an oolong that
had delicate aromas of peach. We couldn't buy, though, because we had
to hustle to our next stop.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>To get there, we walked through the residential part of the Gold Coast,
which locals call the Viagra Triangle because so many older men are seen
there with young women, McCabe said.</p>
<p>One house was Hugh Hefner's first Playboy mansion; when he moved to
L.A., he gave it to the Art Institute of Chicago to use as a freshman
dorm, McCabe told us. The Latin inscription on the brass doorplate
reads, &quot;If you don't swing, don't ring.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon we reached Old Town, an old German neighborhood once nicknamed the
Cabbage Patch, where Oscar Mayer owned a butcher shop. It was a hippie
neighborhood in the 1960s and, despite its proximity to downtown, became
a near ghost town after Democratic Convention rioting in 1968.</p>
<p>Gentrification followed revitalization in the 1980s, and today Old Town
is full of chic bistros, markets and patisseries. It's a place where
you want a fat wallet — and a fast metabolism.</p>
<p>At the Spice House, we parked our noses over bottles of seasonings,
tapping out samples to taste.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_oil_store.jpg" alt="Three oils at Old Town Oil." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Japanese, Greek and Italian oils are available for sampling at Old Town
Oil.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the vine-covered courtyard, we got a lesson in cinnamon, from the
mild Ceylon cinnamon used in Mexican hot chocolate to the Indonesian
&quot;French toast&quot; kind used by Cinnabon and the spicy Vietnamese style
used in Big Red gum and Hot Tamales candies.</p>
<p>Like every spice at the Spice House, they're ground on the premises,
every two or three weeks.</p>
<p>&quot;After the sticks are ground, they'll turn to sawdust after a year,&quot;
McCabe said. &quot;But if they're unground, you could give them to your
grandkids.&quot;</p>
<p>At Old Town Oil, we tried a few of the aged, infused vinegars straight
from the tap, out of little plastic cups. Then we turned into chemists,
mixing and matching the aromatic vinegars with olive oils: strawberry
balsamic with Tuscan herb, white peach vinegar with basil oil.</p>
<p>Visions of summer salads danced in our heads as we hurriedly wrote down
some of our favorite combinations. Then McCabe urged us onward to the
Fudge Pot, one of the oldest Old Town businesses.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_fudge.jpg" alt="Cutting fudge in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Chocolate permeated the air as we walked behind the counter and picked
large pieces of butter toffee from a platter. The shop has the usual
array of fudge, caramels and creams but is famous for novelty chocolates  —&quot;including something used at bachelorette parties,&quot; McCabe said
with wink.</p>
<p>They're all made with 10-pound blocks of chocolate from Chicago's own
Blommer's, the largest processor of cocoa beans in North America.</p>
<p>&quot;We make, consume and sell more chocolate than anyone, including
Hershey's, PA,&quot; she said. &quot;We kick Hershey's butt.&quot;</p>
<p>We took a bathroom break at the Second City Theatre, where rubber
crustaceans were wrapped around the stone faces of famous German writers
on the facade of the former Schiller theater, built in 1892.</p>
<p>On the next street, Delightful Pastries held many tempting trays of
brownies, eclairs and other sweet things. But here, our samples were
savory: apricot and cream-cheese kolaches, a type of less-sweet Danish,
and potato-cheese pierogies, a filled dumpling.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Both are Eastern European in origin.</p>
<p>&quot;Chicago has the largest Polish population outside Warsaw,&quot; McCabe
said. &quot;After the war, many were displaced to Austria, where they
learned to speak German and bake a cake.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously, our food tour couldn't be complete until we'd had a slice
of deep-dish pizza. It came after a pleasant walk through Chicago's
Mid-North district, one of the few with houses that survived the Great
Chicago Fire of 1871.</p>
<p>On our way to the Lincoln Park neighborhood, McCabe entertained us with
tidbits on local architecture and the local obsession, real-estate
prices. She pointed out one International-style house that occupied a
tiny lot on a shady street.</p>
<p>&quot;The architect who built that big steel box got the lot for $11,000 in
the 1970s, and now it's worth $1 million,&quot; she told us.</p>
<p>Just beyond Oz Park, we settled into the basement of Bacino's and dug
into slabs of deep-dish spinach pizza.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_delightful_pastries_window.jpg" alt="Delightful Pastries in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;This is the No. 1 best-selling pizza at Taste of Chicago,&quot; McCabe
said. &quot;The pizza here is really fresh and light, made with no oil in
the pan and fresh spinach. You're not going to feel overwhelmed by this
pizza.&quot;</p>
<p>We were, though, because just one slice of deep-dish pizza is a whole
meal. And oddly, the most &quot;Chicago&quot; stop seemed the most
superfluous, after the nuanced fragrances and flavors we'd experienced
at our previous stops.</p>
<p>As we ate, McCabe polled participants on their favorite stops. There was
at least one vote for each, but the people who didn't say &quot;all of
them&quot; tended to mention Old Town Oil and the Spice House —
surprising, since neither sells &quot;food.&quot;</p>
<p>We were among the few tourists; most of the other people on the tour
were from Chicago or its suburbs, and one young woman and her mother
lived in Lincoln Park. Not every Chicago resident is a foodie, but most
are foodies-in-the-making.</p>
<p>&quot;I was born and raised in Chicago, and I didn't know about these
places,&quot; said one. Another had eaten pastrami for the first time on the
tour.</p>
<p>We left Bacino's with full stomachs and, more importantly, a map of the
stops and a fistful of discounts available only to tour participants.</p>

In Chicago, nearly every neighborhood has a hot-dog stand.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;Old Town Oil, the Spice House and Tea Gschwendner are the places
people run right back to,&quot; McCabe said.</p>
<p>She had us pegged — the next day, we hit all three. Now we're
planning our next food tour. In Chicago, the more you try, the more you
want to try.</p>
