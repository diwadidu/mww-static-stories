<h2>This tiny 'Restaurant Capital of the World' is just a burp on the road.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/dorset_downtown.jpg" alt="Downtown Dorset." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Dorset's "downtown" is a block long.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>By rights, the northern Minnesota hamlet of Dorset shouldn't even exist.</p>
<p>It's on the road to nowhere, a mile and a half off the highway that
links Park Rapids to Walker. It's not on a lake. It has virtually no
houses.</p>
<p>It does, however, have a knack for hyperbole. In the 1920s, it tried
&quot;land of clover, the big white potato and the dairy cow.&quot;</p>
<p>It tried boasting of &quot;the shortest state highway in Minnesota running
through its downtown&quot; and, until 1986, was &quot;the smallest town in the
United States with a bank.&quot;</p>
<p>But Dorset didn't hit its stride until the first Taste of Dorset
festival in 1987, after which it became &quot;Restaurant Capital of the
World&quot; and &quot;Boom Town with a Burp.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, its restaurants keep people milling around town far into the
night during summer. Considering that Dorset is surrounded by farmland
and has only one, block-long street   actually, it's the highway  
that's a fairly odd sight.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;People ask, 'Is something special going on here today?' &quot; says John
Corbid, who restored the Heartland Trail B&amp;B with his wife, Pat.</p>
<p>A century ago, it was saloons that flourished, when Dorset was a stop on
the Great Northern Railway. Farmers and tourists came through until
bigger towns nearby claimed their business, and Dorset, like so many
other villages, began to fade.</p>
<p>In 1977, however, the Heartland State Trail opened on the old rail line,
becoming one of the nation's first paved recreational trails and
bringing tourists back to town.</p>
<p>When the bank closed nine years later, a gift shop and tearoom took its
place. A popular Mexican restaurant opened in a rundown storefront, a
stained-glass studio in a log cabin and a crafts shop in an old barn.</p>
<p>They helped attract an antiques shop, a bookstore, a B&amp;B and an old-time
photo emporium. By 2014, there was Companeros, there was an Italian
restaurant, a soda fountain and a north-country cafe   one restaurant
for every six residents.</p>
<p>Rick Kempnich started Companeros with his wife, Laura, in 1985, and had
to expand the restaurant five times.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/dorset_street.jpg" alt="Dorset is a favorite stop on the Heartland Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Dorset is the ice-cream and snack stop on the Heartland Trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;I think that's why people like to come here; it's kind of chaotic,&quot;
he said. &quot;They just kind of hang out, meet people, talk and have fun.&quot;</p>
<p>In September 2014, fire destroyed Companeros and the adjoining Dorset
House, the soda fountain/ice-cream parlor. A Companeros food truck
debuted in the summer of 2015, and Kempnich hopes another restaurant
will build on the site.</p>
<p>Now, Dorset is more famous for its annual mayoral raffle, where $1 buys
a vote. In 2013, 3-year-old Bobby Tufts was elected, and the adorable
preschooler turned out to be such a media darling that he was elected
for a second term.</p>
<p>In 2015, he endorsed his 3-year-old James as successor, and James won.</p>
<p>Dorset always has had a sense of humor. The Dorset Daily Bugle
chronicles local hyperbole, who goes well beyond &quot;land of clover.&quot;</p>
<p>One year, the big news was the sale of the Dorset pro sports teams and
plans to turn the Dorset Dome into an indoor lake.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then it was the mayor's plans to bring the Winter Olympics to Dorset  
the mayor being a Twin Cities man who was biking through town during
Taste of Dorset, stuck $1 with his name into the ballot box and was
elected in the annual mayoral raffle.</p>
<p>Dorset does get pretty wild during its annual festival in August, when
thousands of people fill the street to eat Mexican mudballs, barbecued
ribs, calzone and quesadillas.</p>
<p>The ladies from the stone First English Lutheran Church sell pie, bands
play, and there are wagon rides, minnow races, a bean toss and a dunk
tank for children.</p>
<p>Prices are low, and despite the crowd, there's a reunion atmosphere  
many of the people are guests at nearby lake resorts who come to Taste
of Dorset every year.</p>
<p>But then the town returns to tranquility. I've gone there most years for
two decades,  wheeling my bike up to the boardwalk outside the Dorset
House, built in 1894 as a general store. Its soda fountain was a welcome
sight for bicyclists.</p>
<p>A block away, the white-frame Heartland Trail B&amp;B once was Dorset's
schoolhouse, built in 1920. Now, it's a pleasant space with a
second-floor deck, high ceilings and Americana décor; each of the six
rooms is named after an elementary grade.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/dorset_inn.jpg" alt="The Heartland Trail B&B." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Sister Wolf Books was one of the first shops, founded by Minneapolis
writer Mary Kay Watson. It's a tricky business, she said, picking out
vacation reading for local resort guests.</p>
<p>&quot;They want what they want,&quot; said Watson. &quot;But I think the people who
like the books I like found me.&quot;  The shop also has a small coffeehouse
called the Wolf Den.</p>
<p>The success of Companeros  enabled the Kempnichs to act as benevolent
landlords to others. One project was the renovation of a small barn into
Front Porch Gifts by Myrna Whitesell, a former resort guest from Iowa.</p>
<p>&quot;There wasn't a day went by that somebody didn't come over to see if
they could help,&quot; Whitesell said. &quot;I've got a new family. Everybody
watches out for everybody else, and that's why this little community
works.&quot;</p>
<p>Add that to a bike trail, a plate of chimichangas and a little
hyperbole, and you've got the Town That Refused to Fade Away.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Dorset, Minnesota</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : It's six miles east of Park Rapids.</p>
<p><em>Events</em> : <a href="http://www.exploreminnesota.com/events/14960/taste-of-dorset">Taste of
Dorset</a>,
first Sunday in August; includes the raffle for mayor.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : The 1920 <a href="http://www.heartlandbb.com">Heartland Trail
B&amp;B</a> has six rooms, 218-732-3252.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/heartland/index.html">Heartland State
Trail</a> :
Dorset is six miles east of the 48-mile trail's western trailhead in
Park Rapids' Heartland Park.</p>
<p>The next town is Nevis, which has shops, cafes and a city beach on Lake
Belle Taine.</p>
<p>Akeley is the home of the state's biggest Paul Bunyan, on whose
outstretched hand people pose for pictures.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/heartland-trail-towns/">Towns of the Heartland
Trail</a>.</p>
<p>Just east of Akeley, the Heartland connects to the <a href="http://www.paulbunyantrail.com">Paul Bunyan State
Trail</a>. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/paul-bunyan-trail/">Bicycling the
Bunyan</a>.</p>
<p>The nine-mile stretch from Akeley to Walker passes bogs and lakes. From
Walker, the trail follows the western shore of Leech Lake and continues
to Cass Lake, much of it near the highway but usually shielded by
vegetation.</p>
<p>The 17-mile Migizi Trail follows the shore of Cass Lake in Chippewa
National Forest.</p>
