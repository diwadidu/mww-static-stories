<h2>In eastern Iowa, a historic village has a long tradition of feeding people well.</h2>

<p>Before 1932, the pious, hard-working people of the Amana Colonies were
the only people in Iowa who got to eat out every night.</p>
<p>Members of the pacifist Community of True Inspiration, they emigrated
from Germany and built seven villages on 25,000 acres of eastern Iowa
farmland. For nearly 90 years, they lived communally, pooling resources
and skills.</p>
<p>Butchers, brewers and winemakers turned out goods for everyone, and
meals were served in 50 communal kitchens.</p>
<p>Then, when the Great Depression crippled trade, the villages dropped the
communal system. Suddenly, there were 50 kitchen bosses who needed a
job.</p>
<p>That's when the restaurants opened, though the hospitality tradition
already was well established.</p>
<p>&quot;People would get off the train to shop and pay 15 cents for a meal in
one of the kitchens,&quot; says Paula Blessman of the Amana Colonies
visitors center. &quot;The cooks were used to serving family-style, where the
side dishes just keep coming.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Tourists still come to the Amanas to eat hearty food and to
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/amana-colonies/">shop</a> for
treats: Old World sausages, handmade chocolates, imported German
delicacies, fruit wines and craft beer.</p>
<p>Amana is the largest and most commercial village. When I was there on a
food tour one October, Blessman started by answering the question
everyone asks.</p>
<p>&quot;For one thing, we're not Amish,&quot; she said. &quot;We get that every day at
the visitors center from people looking for caps and buggies.&quot;</p>
<p>The name the people gave their Iowa colonies, Amana, comes from the
Bible and means &quot;remain true.&quot; They welcomed technological innovations
-'When tractors were developed, we were all over that,' &quot; Blessman
said-and were comfortable with outsiders.</p>
<p>But they continued to speak their native German, went to church 11 times
a week and were happy to live simply.</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't a flashy kind of group,&quot; she said. &quot;It was frowned upon to
make something for beauty's sake, but if it served a purpose, they'd
make it really pretty. We have a lot of beautiful matchboxes.&quot;</p>
<p>Shop signs are uniform, plain black with white block lettering. Villages
look much as they did a century ago: Narrow sidewalks line streets, so
residents could walk to kitchens and general stores, where each family
was given credit according to its size.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/m/amanas_smokehouse.jpg" alt="The Meat Shop in Amana." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Octogenarian Carl Oehl has been working at the Meat Shop since he was
10.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Split-timber fences line tidy lawns, to keep off beef cattle that were
herded through town. The rows of brick and stone cottages are wrapped
with trellises, on which grapevines grow and also help insulate
basements.</p>
<p>At Collectively Iowa, we sampled Royce Bennett's dry and off-dry red
wines made with Iowa grapes, as well as more traditional fruit wines
from other Iowa vintners.</p>
<p>&quot;We're the oddball of the group,&quot; Bennett said. &quot;We have five sweet
wineries, and I felt like doing something different.&quot;</p>
<p>Amana Meat Shop and Smokehouse was around the corner, and jovial
octogenarian Carl Oehl was waiting with slices of beef sticks, jerky,
sausage and Schwartenmagen, or head cheese. But the tastiest morsel was
ham dipped in Oehl's own homemade horseradish jelly.</p>
<p>Oehl is a descendant of the original settlers and still lives around the
corner in the house in which he was born.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm the figure here, the big fat figure,&quot; he joked. &quot;I've worked
here since I was 10 years old, hanging meat over in the smokehouse.&quot; We
sampled quite a bit, but he insisted on sending us off with waxed-paper
doggie bags.</p>
<p>With seven more stops to go, Blessman kept us moving. On the way to
Ackerman Winery, we walked past the Amana General Store, a gift shop
that once sold staples.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;The kitchen bosses came here weekly for cocoa, sugar, salt, spices and
other things made in the outside world,&quot; she said. &quot; When they made
things here in the village-soap, wine or beer-they'd say to the
people, 'It's ready, you can pick up your share on Wednesday.' &quot;</p>
<p>At busy Ackerman, Barb Kellenberger poured us samples of dessert wines
-rhubarb, gooseberry, strawberry, peach, apricot and crimson
cranberry, the perennial best seller.</p>
<p>I liked the red raspberry wine, which tasted like summer and made me
wonder how I could pair it with chocolate.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like putting a bunch of fresh berries in your mouth,&quot;
Kellenberger said. &quot;If you like to play with your wines, it makes a
great raspberry vinaigrette. Or you can take half a cup, a handful of
berries, some ice and ice cream or yogurt and make a smoothie.&quot;</p>
<p>Then we sat down for the main course at Ronneburg Restaurant, a former
communal kitchen named for a castle in Hesse, the German state from
which most of the original settlers came.</p>
<p>Chef Parrish Koele sent out dishes of broccoli salad, spinach dip,
bread, potato dumplings, sauerbraten and wiener schnitzel.</p>
<p>He also put out a bowl of the fragrant spices used in the veal breading
and a dish of gingersnaps, explaining how he uses them to give zing to
the sauerbraten as it marinates over three days.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/m/amanas_cafe_women.jpg" alt="Women have a bite at the Amana bakery." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Ronneburg has helped restore the authenticity of many traditional
German specialties, which had become Americanized. Other restaurants,
such as the Ox Yoke next door, also serve traditional dishes as well as
such Iowa farm food as fried chicken, ham and pork chops.</p>
<p>Koele, like his cousin Carl Oehl, is a descendant, and he said his
grandmother still wears a bonnet, prayer shawl and apron to church,
where women and men still sit separately.</p>
<p>&quot;They have a lot of traditions that are kept alive through the church,&quot;
he said.</p>
<p>We had dessert at the Ox Yoke Inn, which is known for a bakery that
turns out thousands of pies. Even so, the restaurant sometimes runs out
of a particular kind.</p>
<p>&quot;Many people who come here order dessert first, before they order their
entrée,&quot; said Bill Leichsenring Jr., whose father left the colony in
the 1920s to work in Milwaukee, where he patronized Mader's and decided
to return and start a restaurant of his own.</p>
<p>We had the chocolate mousse dessert that won the 50th-birthday recipe
contest and a slice of the even more famous rhubarb pie. Since
beginning, the restaurant has expanded several times; we ate in the
Woodshed Dining Room, named for its previous function.</p>
<p>&quot;My father was a great promoter,&quot; Leichsenring said. &quot;My sister and I
always had to wait on vacations while he finished promoting the Amana
Colonies.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From the Ox Yoke, we moved on to the Amana Colonies Bakery &amp; Cafe for
slices of white bread spread with apple butter and cherry-rhubarb jam.</p>
<p>At the Chocolate Haus, we watched an employee dip cherries and received
an &quot;antler,&quot; a large cluster of cashews topped with the shop's homemade
caramel and a dollop of chocolate.</p>
<p>From the candy store, we walked to Millstream Brewing, on the 6½-mile
mill canal that colony men dug in the 1860s. On warm days, the brewery's
deck fills with beer samplers, but we stayed inside, drinking Iowa pale
ale, Oktoberfest and the popular Schild Brau Amber out of little glass
mugs.</p>
<p>Our last stop was the Village Winery, where vinter Don Krauss greeted us
with hands stained blue from mixing 500 gallons of blueberry wine and
500 gallons of cranberry wine.</p>
<p>&quot;I used 3,000 pounds of sugar, so I'm pretty sore,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Since 1973, Krauss has produced such traditional wines as piestengel,
Amana slang for rhubarb wine. To make that, he said, he needs 11 pounds
of rhubarb to make one gallon of juice. In spring, he makes dandelion
wine, placing newspaper ads to get adequate supplies of the yellow
flower.</p>
<p>By the end of the tour, we knew a lot about Amana traditions as well as
food.</p>
<p>&quot;Amazingly, I spent my whole life in Iowa and I'd never been to Amana,&quot;
said Nancy Aldrich of Cedar Falls. &quot;But I'd been hearing about it for
years. The food is the only thing I knew about this place for sure.&quot;</p>
