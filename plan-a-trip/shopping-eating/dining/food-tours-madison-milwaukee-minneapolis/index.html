<h2>In tourist towns, guides are feeding a growing appetite for culinary walking tours.</h2>

<p>These days, sightseeing tours by trolley or bus seem like old hat.</p>
<p>More and more tourists are discovering that the best way to get to know
a town is through its stomach. In fact, many towns are most famous for
things that are edible.</p>
<p>On a trip to Chicago, my husband and I took one of the Chicago Food
Planet tours. We started on the Gold Coast, assembling our own reuben
with pastrami from the local Vienna Beef, and walked to Lincoln Park,
sampling tea, fudge, artisan oils, kolaches, pierogies and, of course,
deep-dish pizza.</p>
<p>That was so much fun that when we vacationed in Boston, we took a Bites
of Boston tour, sampling fried clams, meat-loaf sandwiches, cookies,
cheese, pizza and Venezuelan bacon-wrapped dates — no Boston baked
beans or Boston cream pie, though.</p>
<p>On spring break in Puerto Vallarta, I found two walking food tours and
took them both, consuming a week's worth of mole enchiladas, empanadas,
tacos, ceviche tostadas and tortilla soup.</p>
<p>Along the way, I also digested all kinds of interesting nuggets not only
about the food, but also local culture, history, architecture, even
real-estate prices and gossip.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Food tours have become so popular that in many cities, the omnivore's
only dilemma is: Which tour?</p>
<p>Typically, all food tours are at the top of the rankings for city
attractions. Who doesn't like to eat?</p>
<p>&quot;It's something everyone can relate to, because everyone has to
eat,&quot; said Lysa Gudz, who operated Tasty Morsel Culinary Excursions
in Traverse City, Mich.</p>
<p>But I like the tours modeled on Chicago Food Planet tours, founded in
2006 and so successful that the company now offers courses and coaching
to would-be tour owners.</p>
<p>These tours are all about the story: Who founded this or that restaurant
or market, and why? What's the background of the local cuisine? What
interesting things happened along the tour route?</p>
<p>Guides are personable, well-informed and a font of anecdotes.  They also
hand out a four-sheet guide that lists the restaurants visited plus
other good restaurants, shows them on a map and includes coupons if you
want to go back to eat or buy something.</p>

<h3>More than tourists</h3>
<p>These tours aren't just for tourists. In fact, at least half of the
participants were locals on every tour I've taken.</p>
<p>One rainy spring week, the Twin Cities Food Tours in Minneapolis offered
a discount on a Saturday tour, so my husband and I signed up.</p>
<p>Local foodies Rebekah Leonhart and Julie Gann had just bought the
company from its original owners, who had taken the Chicago Food Planet
course. They were both at hand at the start of the tour at Local
D'Lish, an &quot;indoor farmers market&quot; not far from the Hennepin Avenue
Bridge.</p>
<p>As we munched on hummus and tabbouli with spelt crackers, Leonhart told
us the market's story: how owner Ann Yin was inspired by the markets of
her husband's native China, where people shop daily and have personal
relationships with the vendors who grow their food.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything here comes from within 100 miles, and 70 percent of the
companies are owned by women,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>As we walked across the Mississippi to northeast Minneapolis, we learned
about early Minneapolis history.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Once a shabby neighborhood of Eastern European émigrés, most of whom had
moved on by the 1980s, it's now full of restaurants, shops and condos.</p>
<p>Our first stop was Punch Pizza, whose founder grew up in Milan and
returned to St. Paul with a nostalgia for Neapolitan pizza cooked in a
wood-fired oven.</p>
<p>Our samples included the borghata pie with black olives, eggplant and
goat cheese, also known as the &quot;Meryl Streep&quot; because, when the star
was in town filming &quot;A Prairie Home Companion,&quot; she said it was the
best pizza she'd ever had.</p>
<p>Then we walked across the street to Kramarczuk's, where we were hit by
a garlicky perfume of homemade sausage, laced with traces of pastries,
cabbage rolls and freshly baked bread.</p>
<p>Founded in 1954 and run by the son and grandchildren of Wasyl and Anna
Kramarczuk, war refugees from Poland, the butcher
shop/deli/restaurant/bakery had just received &quot;America's Classics&quot;
designation from the James Beard Foundation.</p>
<p>Sitting around a table as the lunchtime crowd swirled around us, we ate
dense kielbasa sausages, homemade sauerkraut and pierogi, potato-filled
dumplings served with horseradish-laced sour cream.</p>
<p>Around the corner, we settled into Gorkha Palace, an
Indian/Nepali/Tibetan restaurant. Its owner had made such a splash
selling her momos at the Mill City Farmers Market, she opened a
restaurant by popular demand.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_fudge.jpg" alt="Cutting fudge in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Town since 1963.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We had the momos, filled with yak meat from a local ranch, and pakora,
vegetable fritters fried in chickpea batter and served with tamarind and
mint sauces.</p>
<p>From there, we walked on to the art-filled Gardens of Salonica for
dessert. Its owner also started her Greek restaurant by popular demand,
after her boughatsa-filled phyllo pastries were a hit at art
fairs and parties.</p>
<p>We each got a plate of three: lemon, chocolate and honey-walnut, like a
lighter, crispier baklava.</p>
<p>There was only one thing missing from our food tour of Minneapolis:
Scandinavian food.</p>
<p>That's a great heritage, but not such an appealing cuisine. Luckily,
Italians, Poles, Nepalis and Greeks also came to feed our city, along
with Vietnamese, Mexicans and many other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>They're all part of the Minneapolis story.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Food tours in Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Madison and Chicago</h3>
<p>Reserve early for summer weekends. Tours go out rain or shine; wear
comfortable shoes and clothing.</p>
<p>If you have an allergy or food restriction, let the company know when
reserving and it will arrange for alternate choices.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Because the group has to keep moving, you won't be able to buy anything
during the tour. Many tours, however, give you coupons to the places
visited, so you can get a discount later.</p>
<p>Most tours cost $50-$80.</p>
