<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/nisswa_bar_harbor_patios.jpg" alt="Bar Harbor restaurant on Gull Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Bar Harbor on Gull Lake started as a casino in 1938.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In summer, the crowds pour into the Brainerd Lakes, the Minnesota
vacation land that's been stomping grounds for millionaires and middle
managers alike since the loggers finished up and headed west.</p>
<p>What's it known for? Lakes, of course. And golf.</p>
<p>It's not so known for its restaurants, but that may be because only
locals know the best places.</p>
<p>When you're a vacationer, it's hard to find good places to eat. After
a busy day on the lake, you'd settle for a burger and a beer-but
why not grilled lamb chops Provencal or duck breast with red currant
demi-glace?</p>
<p>Luckily for you, the locals now are letting you in on their secrets. It
turns out that this popular lakes area has top chefs who could work
anywhere but choose to live where others can only vacation-go
figure.</p>
<p>Sample sushi in a Prairie-style dining room or lounge in a glittering
martini bar; these aren't your grandparents' restaurants. But if
you'd rather have walleye or a steak at a 1920s log roadhouse, you can
do that, too.</p>
<p>And patios? We know all the good ones.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Here's our irreverent guide to dining in the heart of the Brainerd
Lakes, from the city to Nisswa.</p>
<p>For restaurants north of Nisswa, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-brainerd-lakes-whitefish/">Dining up north: Pequot to
Crosslake</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-hackensack-longville-walker/">Dining up
north: Longville to
Walker</a>.</p>
<p>For more about bicycling, golfing and sightseeing in the area, see our
other <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/brainerd-lakes/">Brainerd Lakes stories</a>.</p>
<h3>Brainerd-Baxter</h3>
<p>In spite of being the center of population, the Brainerd-Baxter area is
not the center of fine dining.</p>
<p>The Washington Street and Minnesota 371 strips are peppered with the
usual assortment of fast food, franchised and chain restaurants. The
ethnic offerings include <em>El Tequila</em> (218-454-0618) and <em>Pancho and
Lefty's Mexican</em> (218-829-0489), as well as the very nice <em>China Garden
Buffet</em> .</p>
<p>For multi-napkin favorites, there is <em>Buffalo Wild Wings</em> and <em>Famous
Dave's</em> in a strip mall. There is also the sporty <a href="http://www.grizzlysgrill.com">Grizzly's
Grill</a> featuring fire-grilled options
along with a pretty typical casual menu (218-822-3877).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prairiebay.com">Prairie Bay</a> (218-824-6444) is tucked
awkwardly behind the Comfort Inn on the Minnesota 371 strip in Baxter,
Brainerd's low-profile twin.</p>
<p>The building has admirers and detractors. The former think it is a
beautiful example of a Frank Lloyd Wright-style Prairie design, and the
latter think it's a Perkins with attitude.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/nisswa_sherwood_chef.jpg" alt="A chef at Sherwood Forest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Grand View Lodge</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At the Grand View restaurants, a chef prepares a plate of walleye.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>That aside, the star is chef Matt Annand, who once was the local
wunderkind and now is an established pro who consistently turns out
well-crafted, cutting-edge offerings.</p>
<p>Pick your trend: sushi, tapas, braised pork belly or beef short ribs,
duck confit, pizzas and pastas, stuffed sandwiches and burgers, even
fish and chips and a quirky tuna-noodle casserole. It's all there.</p>
<p>The bar and beverage service seems to be a bit of an afterthought, and
the parking-lot views take away some of the cachet of the dining
experience, but consistent food quality, pretty good service and edgy
lunch offerings put Prairie Bay near the top of our list.</p>
<p>A couple of reports have mentioned inconsistency, which may be a result
of chef Annand spreading himself across multiple venues (a food truck,
bistro and catering). Check the website for frequent special events.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blackbearlodgemn.com">Black Bear Lodge and Saloon</a>
(218-828-8400), also on 371 north, features an award-winning log
building with a roomy bar on one side, dining room on the other and a
prime rib/private dining loft above.</p>
<p>The menu holds no surprises, the service is pleasant, and the bar can be
fun during events and on game days. It's worth a trip to check out the
building.</p>
<p>A little farther north, <strong><a href="http://arrowwoodbrainerdlodge.com/dining/">Baxter's Bar &amp;
Grill</a></strong> at Arrowwood Lodge
at Brainerd Lakes (218-822-5634) has a diverse menu for locals as well
as hotel guests.</p>
<p>In that same neighborhood, occupying the former Famous Dave's BBQ
location, is <strong><a href="http://www.bouldertaphouse.com/baxter-mn/">The Boulder Tap
House</a></strong> , which is the
definitive All-American Sports Bar. It's all about wings (20 different
kinds), burgers (even more), tap beer (42 that we counted), and TVs (at
least 30).</p>
<p>The staff seems upbeat and well-trained, and the locals began swarming
in shortly after its summer 2013 opening.</p>
<p>On Washington Street near downtown Brainerd, <a href="http://www.nwpizzaboardwalkbagel.com">Northwest Pizza Boardwalk
Bread and Bagel</a> (218-825-5000) is
worth a mention. It's a great deli-style place to pop in for a good
sandwich on home-baked bread, along with soup or pizza. In 2012, new
owners have brought new energy to an already nice lunch option.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Gull Lake</h3>
<p>The road around Gull Lake is shaped like the letter &quot;d,&quot; with the
straight side being Minnesota 371 and the circle being County Road 77,
which loops around the west side of the lake before returning.</p>
<p>The south side of the loop is where you will find the massive Madden's
and Cragun's resorts. If you like the golf-course scene (see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/golfing/brainerd-golf-guide/">Golfing
the Brainerd
Lakes</a> ),
both the Madden's Classic and Cragun's Legacy courses have pretty nifty
restaurants for daylight dining.</p>
<p>All the way around on the west side of the lake is the place locals will
recognize as Kelly's. Or maybe they won't. After a couple of shifts in
ownership, Kelly's is now <a href="http://www.jakescitygrille.com/">Jake's City
Grille</a>, an affiliate of the eponymous
group of Twin Cities suburban restaurants.</p>
<p>The Jacob brothers, Rob and Tony, are part-time Gull residents who have
brought big-city styling and professionalism to this woodsy setting.</p>
<p>The place is spotless and features a dynamite outdoor patio for balmy
summer evenings. The menu is diverse-casual, with Asian, Southwestern,
Greek, Italian and north-woods (phew!) influences, and the staff is very
well-trained. We loved the rosemary roast chicken.</p>
<p>The former Quarterdeck resort on the northwest side of Gull lake has
been renovated and now is the <strong>LakeShore Lodge</strong> . Its new <a href="http://thelakeshorelodge.com/restaurant/">Getaway
Summer Bistro on Gull</a> is
managed by Prairie Bay veterans Shane Rhuby and Derek Hyatt.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/nisswa_freddys_patio.jpg" alt="Freddy's Grill at The Pines." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Grand View Lodge</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Freddy's Grill, the patio overlooks The Pines golf course.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Swinging back to the east on the north side of Gull, you will find the
venerable <em>Sherwood Forest Tavern</em> (218-963-6155).</p>
<p>It reopened in May 2012 as a pub, with the owners of the Blarney Pub &amp;
Grill in Minneapolis moving their team to the north woods. It's a
low-energy sort of place, with a nice woodsy patio and a familiar menu.</p>
<p>Another new version of an old favorite is <em>Cowboy's Restaurant</em>
(218-963-6200), occupying the former Matty's location on the north side
of the road. Krista Knudsen, a former Matty's manager, and her husband,
Kevin, a current Zorbaz manager, are the new proprietors.</p>
<p>They have made some minor changes to the building, and they will have to
work to reconstruct the magic that was Matty's.</p>
<p>A bit further east and back on the water is <a href="http://www.barharborsupperclub.com">Bar Harbor Supper
Club</a> (218-963-2568). Perched on the
shore of Gull Lake Narrows, this institution is half Gull Lake summer
resident hangout, and half charcoal fine-dining option.</p>
<p>It started as a casino in 1938 and put in a kitchen when gaming was shut
down in 1946. The latest version of Bar Harbor was built in 2004, with a
nautical theme and summer patio to complement beautiful lakeside views.</p>
<p>New ownership and a costly renovation in 2012 has dramatically upgraded
the whole package. If you liked Bar Harbor before, you will love it now.</p>
<p>With steady business year-round, the staff is made up of seasoned
dining-room veterans, along with a new and well-trained staff of eager
beavers.</p>
<p>Chef P. J. Severson (formerly of Sherwood Forest) is in charge of the
spacious new kitchen and has built an interesting yet familiar menu. Our
favorite on a recent visit was the bistro steak, which is a classic
steak frites with some updates.</p>
<p>There's usually entertainment on summer weekends. If you're a wine
aficionado, you'll enjoy the wine cellar, where you can stash your own
bottles or choose from their nice selection.</p>
<p>Almost across the channel from Bar Harbor is
<a href="http://www.zorbaz.com">Zorbaz</a> pizza and Mexican restaurant 
(218-963-4790). Zorbaz has a string of lakeside eateries throughout
Minnesota, each with local partners who oversee operations.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The food is the traditional burrito-pizza-nacho fare served amid a
visual explosion of design elements. There is a roomy patio for lakeside
dining and two levels inside to separate the families from the later
night crowd. Managing partner Lee Johnson is one of the nicest people in
the industry, and that carries through to his staff.</p>
<p>Just up the road is <a href="http://www.lostlake.com">Lost Lake Lodge</a>
(218-963-2681), which has been a foodie favorite for many years,
establishing a vaunted reputation under previous owners Tim, Cindy and
K.C. Moore.</p>
<p>Lost Lake may not be your every-night choice for dinner (unless you are
staying there, with dinner included). With an ever-changing fixed-price
menu and choices limited to three, four or five courses, it tends to
lend itself to special occasions.</p>
<p>The choices are varied, with offerings from bison to boar and gravlax to
walleye, and a nice wine selection to accompany your meal choices.</p>
<p>The bread is baked from flour ground in the in-house grist mill and
herbs grown in a kitchen garden, so there are plenty of unique touches.
Save room for the made-from-scratch desserts.</p>
<p>Like many chef-driven restaurants, the service doesn't quite reach those
same heights, but with a good meal in a lovely room, it really doesn't
have to.</p>
<p>Before reaching 371 on the northeastern leg of 77, you will pass Grand
View Lodge on the south and the Pines golf course on the north.
<em>Freddy's Grill</em> at The Pines is a nice
lunch-on-the patio place.</p>
<p>On the south, in an unlikely location below the Grand View Conference
Center, is <a href="http://www.grandviewlodge.com/pages/Cru">Cru</a>
(218-963-8756), the latest in a stable of dining options at the resort.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/r/brainerd_ivens.jpg" alt="Iven's on the Bay near Brainerd." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Just north of Brainerd, Iven's on the Bay overlooks North Long Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Cru has a clubby feel, with deep wood accents and a length-of-the-room
wine cave. The wines are visible through a glass wall, and your server
will be happy to take you on a tour of the temperature-controlled room.</p>
<p>The bad news is that Cru's menu is very limited, with half a dozen
offerings in three categories. The good news is that each menu item is
a gem, and whether you opt for a grilled romaine salad and small plate
of firecracker shrimp, or a large plate, such as the chile-rubbed
ribeye, you will be pleased.</p>
<p>The pricing seems very attractive in this setting, but the portions are
not large, so you should think about a multi-course experience.</p>
<p>Service can be decent, unless you see your server heading to the wine
cave with a large table of guests. The management team seem to watch for
the inevitable lapses and is quick to fill in.</p>
<p>Cru reminds us of the 502 at the Chase in Walker, but with better food,
and a better room (if you don't count the lake outside the window of the
Chase).</p>
<p>Back on the straight leg of the letter &quot;d&quot; (Minnesota 371), on the
southeast side of Gull Lake, is <a href="http://www.erniesongull.com">Ernie's on
Gull</a> (218-829-8913). If you find yourself
looking for a decent lunch in a perfect lakeside setting, this is your
spot.</p>
<p>Near a dead end off Gull Dam Road, Ernie's has patio seating that is
almost on top of the lake, with 10-mile views across the water.</p>
<p>Despite recent changes in the kitchen, there's no reason to expect
significant changes in a reasonably sophisticated menu.</p>
<p>Continuing north on 371 is another of our Gull Lake favorites, <a href="http://www.ivensonthebay.com">Iven's
on the Bay</a> (218-829-9872). Overlooking
North Long Lake, the current edition of Iven's was built in 2006 after a
February fire totaled the original structure.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/nisswa_raffertys.jpg" alt="Rafferty's Pizza in Nisswa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Nisswa, Rafferty's serves pizza on a tree-shaded patio.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The rebuild boasts a flashy martini bar, comfortable dining room and
downstairs private dining, all with lake views. Iven was a fish guy, and
that was his menu emphasis, but with a change in ownership and a new
chef, Tim Anderson, the menu has expanded, and the result is more
cutting-edge.</p>
<p>Chef Anderson caught on with John Dayton's crew, including über-chef
Stephen Pyles at top-rated Routh Street Café and Baby Routh in Dallas,
and then followed Dayton when he repeated the theme at Goodfellows and
Tejas in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>After other metro top jobs, Anderson made a lifestyle decision to ply
his talents in the lake country, and the results are terrific.</p>
<p>Walleye remains the star on the menu, but chef specials and theme
dinners add to the interest. Iven's is a consistent award-winner for its
wine selections</p>
<p>There are a couple of stinker table locations perched precariously in
server paths, so make sure you call for a reservation. And the
dining-room management team can be a little crabby, so plan to bring
your own fun and enjoy the food.</p>
<h3>Nisswa</h3>
<p>Nisswa may be the shopping hub of the Gull Lake area, but that doesn't
extend to dining.</p>
<p><em>Ganley's</em> is the local breakfast and lunch place,
<a href="http://www.raffertyspizza.com">Rafferty's</a> (218-963-3023) is a
top-notch pizza option (along with locations in Crosslake and Brainerd),
and the <strong>Pickle Factory</strong> (known locally as
&quot;The Pickle&quot;) is the municipal liquor outlet and local watering hole.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Dining in Brainerd-Nisswa lakes country</h3>
<p><em>Where to go</em> : In addition to the restaurants listed here, there are
dozens of bars with food, so find one with vehicles in the lot that
match yours.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : Most of these restaurants are dramatically seasonal, so
the hours, days of operation and reservation policies fluctuate. Call
before going, or pick up a local &quot;shopper&quot; or weekly newspaper in the
area for the latest updates.</p>
<p><em>What to wear</em> : Any restaurant in this area is going to be casual
dress, although there are a few where jeans and T-shirts might be
uncomfortable.</p>
