<h2>Once known for its dives, this Lake Superior tourist magnet now boasts brewpubs and locavore cafes.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_301.jpg" alt="Restaurant 301 in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Superior Street, Restaurant 301 is lined by windows.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Duck confit with honey aioli and caramelized shallots. Grass-fed beef
medallions with bacon potato croquettes. Vanilla cake with
white-chocolate espresso frosting and pumpkin ale truffles.</p>
<p>Yes, you can get that in Duluth.</p>
<p>The restaurants in this Lake Superior port town haven't always had a
great reputation. But that's changed.</p>
<p>Legions of tourists have brought pickier palates. Young new residents,
lured from bigger cities by Duluth's outdoor scene, have brought a
taste for craft beer and locally sourced ingredients.</p>
<p>Now, you can eat well in Duluth.</p>
<p>There are so many good restaurants it's hard to know which to try next.
We like to sample them during <a href="https://www.downtownduluth.com/eat-downtown/">Restaurant
Weeks</a>, usually
in March and November, when a two- or three-course lunch is $10 and a
three-course dinner is $25.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Some restaurants go all out, hoping to attract customers who will
return.</p>
<p>Bellisio's and Midi generally offer the best three-course lunches. For
dinner, 301 always offers an appealing showcase of its food (see the
menu above).</p>
<p>And for the rest of the year? Our pick for best fine dining is
Restaurant 301. For a casual breakfast or lunch, the Duluth Grill.</p>
<p>The Apostle Supper Club and Va Bene Caffe have the best views.</p>
<p>The best outdoor dining is at Silos Restaurant, overlooking the harbor
at the new Pier B Resort. On Canal Park, it's at Canal Park Brewing. For best cheap eats, head for 7 West Taphouse.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Dining in Duluth</h3>
<p>On summer and fall weekends, either reserve a table or call 15 or 20
minutes ahead to put your name on the waiting list.</p>
<p>Most of the best places to eat are downtown and on Canal Park, with one
notable exception: the Duluth Grill in west Duluth.</p>
<p>For more about planning a trip, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/best-duluth-minnesota/">Duluth
101</a>.</p>

The glassed-in porch of Va Bene has a killer view of the Aerial Lift
Bridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Fine dining on Canal Park</h3>
<p>Canal Park is where the tourists are, so restaurants can and do charge a
lot of money.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.bellisios.com/">Bellisio's Italian Restaurant</a></strong>: A meal
at this restaurant, just a block from the Aerial Lift Bridge, counts as
a splurge. Even a plate of pasta from the menu of Italian basics —
alfredo, arrabbiata, bolognese, rigatoni — costs well over $20, less at lunch.</p>
<p>Why eat there? It has a <em>romantic atmosphere</em> and the city's largest
<em>wine list.</em>  There's a small covered patio for warm weather.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lakeaveduluth.com/"><strong>Lake Avenue Restaurant &amp; Bar</strong></a>:
This locavore cafe in the DeWitt-Seitz Marketplace, once our favorite
place to eat, has become way pricier, and service can be a little
chilly.</p>
<p>Why eat there? The food is very good, and it has the city's <em>quirkiest
menu</em> — try the cuttlefish if it's available — and one of the best
for pescaterians and vegetarians. There's a deck for warm weather.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.pierbresort.com/food-drink/?gclid=CNH_mNPM_c0CFUQehgodAIYE0g">Silos
Restaurant</a></strong>: In the Pier B Resort on the other side of Bayfront Festival Park, this
restaurant has a waterfront patio that faces the Lift Bridge.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Why eat there? The <em>view,</em>  obviously, and music from frequent concerts
and festivals. But the food also can be very good: Try the red snapper
tacos and elk-bison burger with pear chutney.</p>
<p>While you wait for a table, take a drink up to the second-floor deck and
enjoy the view. Bonus: You can <em>park for free</em> in the resort lot.</p>
<h3>Fine dining downtown</h3>
<p>It's rare that hotel restaurants are among the best a town has to
offer. But that's the case in Duluth.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://restaurant301.com/">Restaurant 301</a></strong>: This restaurant in the
Sheraton serves sophisticated, seasonal versions of such classics as
short ribs, salmon and pork tenderloin.</p>
<p>Why eat there? The food and service are <em>consistently good,</em>  and the
space is small but comfortable, with a fireplace and large windows
overlooking East Superior Street.</p>
<p>During Restaurant Weeks, its menus are among the best deals.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/i/silos_meal.jpg" alt="Eating at Silos in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the patio of Silos, diners have a view of the harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.radissonhotelsamericas.com/en-us/hotels/radisson-duluth/restaurant-bar">The Apostle Supper Club</a></strong>: The menu is a
little more straightforward at this revolving restaurant, formerly JJ Astor, atop the
Radisson on West Superior Street — classics, such as filet mignon, walleye, surf and turf.</p>
<p>Why eat there? It has a sweeping, <em>360-degree view</em> of the lake and
town.</p>
<p><a href="https://zeitgeistarts.com/cafe/"><strong>Zeitgeist Arts Cafe</strong></a>: There are
only a few tables at this restaurant, which adjoins a theater and
cinema, and the atmosphere is casual chic. It offers classy comfort food
— roast chicken, pot pie and Lake Superior trout as well as rice bowls
and small plates.</p>
<p>Why eat there? It has a nice <em>brunch</em> menu and small but good
<em>craft-beer selection</em> .</p>
<p><a href="http://boatclubrestaurant.com/"><strong>The Boat Club</strong></a>: This restaurant in
the lower level of the Fitger's complex, replacing Midi, serves steaks,
seafood and fish, with prices on the high side.</p>
<p>Why eat there? There's a <em>beautiful view</em> of the lake from wall-to-wall
windows.</p>
<h3>Casual dining on Canal Park</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://canalparkbrewery.com">Canal Park Brewing Company</a></strong>: This
popular restaurant offers well-prepared sandwiches, friendly service and
its own beer, which you can try in flights of four. In summer, you'll
have to wait quite a while for a table.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_beer.jpg" alt="A flight of beer from Canal Park Brewery." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On a warm day, it doesn't get any better than sampling beer on the
patio of Canal Park Brewing.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Why eat there? It has the city's <em>best patio</em> that faces the lake, and
a rare side patio that gets <em>afternoon sun.</em></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://northernwaterssmokehaus.com/">Northern Waters Smokehaus</a></strong>:
This small deli in a corner of the Dewitt-Seitz building offers a
delicious selection of sandwiches made with cured meats. There's always
a line, so don't expect fast service.</p>
<p>Why eat there? You probably won't want to, but you can put together a
nice <em>picnic</em> to eat while watching the boat traffic.</p>
<p><a href="https://grandmasrestaurants.com/"><strong>Grandma's Saloon &amp; Grill</strong></a>: This
place galvanized development on Canal Park when it opened in 1976 and
sponsored the first Grandma's Marathon in 1977.</p>
<p>Why eat there? It's still a <em>fun place,</em>  and the portions are huge.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.grandmasrestaurants.com/littleangies/">Little Angie's
Cantina</a></strong>: This
restaurant in the Dewitt-Seitz building offers Mexican-American food
that's especially popular with tourists and the younger crowd.</p>

Old Chicago, Famous Dave's and Red Lobster.</p>
<h3>Casual dining downtown</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.vabenecaffe.com/va-bene-caffe.html">Va Bene Caffe</a></strong>:
Just beyond Fitger's, this sunny Italian cafe offers well-prepared
panini, pasta and salads.</p>
<p>Why eat there? Its glassed-in porch above the Lakewalk has a <em>lovely
view</em> of Canal Park, and the <em>gelato</em> is wonderful.</p>
<p><a href="https://fitgersbrewhouse.com/"><strong>Fitger's Brewhouse</strong></a>: This lively
restaurant is a good place to go for an excellent burger and excellent
beer. It's usually hard to get a table, but hosts will give you a
beeper so you can shop while you wait.</p>
<p>Why eat there? It's got a <em>fun atmosphere,</em>  consistently <em>good pub
food</em> and live music.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_malt_shop2.jpg" alt="The Portland Malt Shoppe in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

restaurant is far off the tourist path, next to a Burger King just off
the 27th Avenue West exit of I-35. But the locals definitely know about
it, because it's always packed.</p>
<p>It now closes at 3 p.m., however.</p>

made with fresh, organic and locally sourced ingredients. It doesn't
serve beer or wine.</p>

<p><a href="https://spoons-bar-grill.business.site/"><strong>Spoon's Bar &amp; Grill</strong></a>:

<p><a href="http://www.omcsmokehouse.com/"><strong>OMC Smokehouse</strong></a>: This convivial

ingredients.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://corktowndeli.com/"><strong>Corktown Deli and Brews</strong></a>: This

everyone can find something appealing on its menu. Service can be
spotty but generally is enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Why eat there? It's got a <em>big patio</em> with fire pits and festive
lighting. And because it's two miles above the lake, it's warmer
there.</p>
<h3>Casual dining elsewhere</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/PhoholicDuluth/">Phoholic Taste of Vietnam</a></strong>: This restaurant has no atmosphere at all and sits on Central Entrance, a busy artery in West Duluth that's far off the tourist path. Oh, and its parking lot is too small.</p>
<p>Why eat there? Because the food is <em>extremely good</em> and the staff is <em>friendly.</em></p>
<h3>Fine dining on Scenic 61</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sceniccafe.com/">New Scenic Cafe</a></strong>: This sunny little
cafe on old Highway 61, between Duluth and Two Harbors, is a fixture of
farm-to-table dining. The atmosphere still is casual, but the dinner
menu has become high-priced.</p>
<p>In summer, you'll have to wait quite a while to get a table.</p>
<p>Why eat there? It's a good place to treat yourself to a fancy lunch or
<em>pie and coffee.</em></p>
