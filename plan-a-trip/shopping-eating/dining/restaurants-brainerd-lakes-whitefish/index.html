<p>North of moneyed Gull Lake, the Brainerd Lakes area starts to look more
like traditional Minnesota resort country.</p>
<p>There's still plenty of money and big boats, especially on the
Whitefish Chain. But this also is a place where vacationing families
gather to race ducks (Fridays at 1 p.m., Pine River) and eat beans (Bean
Hole Days in <a href="http://www.explorebrainerdlakes.com/about-brainerd-lakes/communities/pequot-lakes-breezy-point-jenkins/">Pequot
Lakes</a>, July 8-9 in 2014).</p>
<p>Bicyclists whiz past on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/paul-bunyan-trail/">Paul Bunyan State
Trail</a>. To
explore it, head out on the 54-mile <a href="http://paulbunyanscenicbyway.org">Paul Bunyan Scenic
Byway</a>.</p>
<p>Its two loops take motorists-or bicyclists-past nature trails,
wildlife areas, sleepy little resort villages and a popular U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers campground that includes one of the area's few
public beaches.</p>
<p>The little county roads that weave past Pelican, Cross and Whitefish
lakes are lined with all kinds of places to eat, from the swank eateries
of Breezy Point to friendly neighborhood saloons and a Chicago-style
Italian bistro.</p>
<p>You'll find plenty of ribs and chops, but also wild-rice omelets,
whale-sized walleye, all-you-can-eat pasta and the infamous Garbage
Pizza.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Here's our insiders' guide to dining in and around the Whitefish
Chain, the lower-profile but still-busy northern edge of the Brainerd
Lakes.</p>
<p>For our two other restaurant guides, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-brainerd-lakes/">Dining up north: Brainerd to
Nisswa</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-hackensack-longville-walker/">Dining up north: Longville
to Walker</a>.</p>
<p>For more about bicycling, golfing and sightseeing in the area, see our
other <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/brainerd-lakes/">Brainerd Lakes stories</a>.</p>
<h3>Pequot Lakes</h3>
<p>Pequot Lakes is a good example of the ebbing and flowing of the local
dining scene. Having lost a couple good food options in recent years,
the Pequot scene is missing a bit of its vibrancy.</p>
<p>One standby is <a href="http://www.timberjacksmokehouse.com">Timberjack Smokehouse and
Saloon</a> (218-568-6070) under the
guidance of veteran operator Bill Nemitz. You can see the smokehouse in
front of the restaurant on the west side of 371 just south of Pequot
Lakes, and that should be your focus.</p>
<p>The menu offers the usual fare, but the smoked meat items, including
ribs, chicken, Cornish game hen, pork loin, salmon and shrimp are the
stars, along with the new addition of smoked prime rib on Saturdays.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/r/breezy_point_antlers_waterfall.jpg" alt="The patio at Antlers in Breezy Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Breezy Point</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The patio of Antlers at Breezy Point Resort overlooks a waterfall.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A reworked entry features an out-front entertainment nook that can be
loud for diners on weekends, so come early if you want to talk during
dinner. The service is amateurish, but the bar can be fun, especially
when Salome is working.</p>
<p>In Pequot Lakes proper, there are a couple of options. <strong><a href="http://www.luckystavernpequot.com/">Lucky's
Tavern</a></strong> is just off to the east of
371 in the former Sibley Station/Mayson's space.</p>
<p>Lucky's has a bit of an Irish pub theme going, but the product offerings
don't really support that concept. You will be greeted by a pool table
when you walk in the front door, to set the mood.</p>
<p>The staff and new management came from Pestello's, and it is the same
sort of experience, but a little brighter and fresher.</p>
<p>On the other side of Minnesota 371, <em>Pestello's</em> (218-568-9950) is a lot
more bar than grill. It is still a friendly place to grab a burger and
beverage if you happen to be in town. The experienced Cole Nelson mans
the kitchen.</p>
<p>At the stoplight, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/LakesLatte">Lakes Latte</a></strong>
(218-568-5995) offers an array of coffees with wraps and sandwiches at
lunch.</p>
<h3>Breezy Point</h3>
<p>Heading east on County Road 11 from Pequot Lakes to Breezy Point,
you'll find several dining options, including
<a href="http://www.breezypointresort.com/vacation/dining/index.html">Antlers</a>
at Breezy Point Resort (218-562-7162).</p>
<p>We break a couple of our own rating rules by including this resort-owned
golf-course restaurant. A soft market has forced Antlers into seasonal
operation, but they remain a favorite among locals in the summer
months.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The menu is nice, not great, but the food is consistently prepared well,
the service is competent, and wine choices are substantial. There are
popular early-bird options and a nice patio for summer outdoor dining.</p>
<p>Also popular are the dining options at the <em>Marina II</em>*
restaurant at the resort proper, and the
summer Saturday-night Elvis concerts at the <strong>Dockside</strong> grift.</p>
<p>In the adjoining town of Breezy Point, Billy's, The Commander and Prime
Time each is a local gathering place for food and fun.</p>
<p><em>Billy's</em> (218-562-4667), is the newest addition, with a renovation of
the old Birchwood property adjacent to the ice arena on County Road 11.</p>
<p>Billy Pestello (of the same family but no business affiliation with
Pestello's in Pequot Lakes) has put together a nice, inexpensive dining
option. His strong suit is promoting local community events with close
ties to the hockey community. (Did we mention the arena next door?)</p>
<p>The big circular bar is a must to attract a year-round crowd. Currently,
the kitchen seems to be run by committee. The result is a loss of
consistency in food quality, but it is still pretty good more often than
not, with excellent burgers. The service is competent and friendly.</p>
<p>The signature menu item at <strong>The Commander</strong>
(218-562-4198) is the Garbage Pizza, and that pretty much tells you
everything you need to know about your food options.</p>
<p>And yet, the place has an endearing quality with families running about
during early evening hours and a rock band vibe after dark. Besides, who
wouldn't like something called a Garbage Pizza?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.primetimemn.com">Prime Time Food and Spirits</a>
(218-562-4455), around a corner and up the road from Breezy Point
Resort, is a conglomeration of snow tubing, rock bands, Texas Hold-em,
bar bingo, meat raffles, and a pretty extensive menu of ribs, chicken,
steaks, pastas and sandwiches.</p>
<p>The dining room is separated from the bar, so your food experience may
not get confused with everything else, but if you are in search of a
quiet romantic evening, this might not be your first choice.</p>
<p>Across from the Breezy Point Resort gates, Munchies has been replaced by
<strong>Pine Peaks</strong>, which is a second location
for the Crosslake breakfast institution.</p>
<p>On County Road 39 north of Breezy Point, you will find <a href="http://www.norwayridge.com">Norway Ridge
Supper Club</a> (218-543-6136). The Adkins
sisters, Jackie and Alicia, are starting their third decade of presiding
over this Ideal Corners legend, while Chef Mikey Cossert has become a
fixture in the kitchen.</p>
<p>They have served the same items for so many years that it seems they
have invented wild-rice soup, whale-sized walleye and home-smoked ribs
and chicken. Actually, their predecessors may have invented their
sourdough-battered and deep-fried veggies.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/e/pequot_norway_ridge.jpg" alt="Norway Ridge near Pequot Lakes." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Opened in 1948, Norway Ridge overlooks Kimble Lake in Ideal Corners,
south of the Whitefish Chain.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Although the building doesn't have a lot of drive-up appeal, the dining
room has a classic up-north feel with views through the trees of Kimble
Lake below, and the bar feels warm and clubby.</p>
<p>In spite of closing during the coldest months, Norway Ridge manages to
keep enough returning staff (some family members) to provide competent,
steady service and well-prepared dishes. It's good every day but worthy
of a special occasion.</p>
<p>A bit farther north on 39, near the junction with County Road 16, is the
<em>Old Milwaukee Saloon and Eatery</em> (218-543-4117), known locally as
&quot;Ideal&quot; due to its Ideal Township central location.</p>
<p>Jeff Feltman runs a comfortable old-time saloon with casual meals and
cold beer. It's a handy stop for the after-golf crowd from nearby
Whitefish Golf Club. Ideal has added a private dining option for 2012,
with local star-chef Tom Johnson catering small-group gatherings on
site.</p>
<p>Heading back west on County Road 16, at the junction of 371, is the <a href="http://www.apineplaza.com">A
Pine</a> restaurant (218-568-8353), which is a
breakfast, lunch, dinner and pie place that also serves beer and wine.
It has a nice local clientele and makes for an easy stop on a trip along
Minnesota 371.</p>
<p>Going north on 371, in the whistle-stop town of Jenkins, you'll find
the tidy little <em>Underdogs Bar and Grill</em> (218-568-7714), which serves a
surprisingly good burger in a NASCAR/Glenn Beck atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Pine River</h3>
<p>Pine River, like Jenkins, seems a bit more farm country than lake
country.</p>
<p>So it's lucky to have <a href="http://bitesgrill.com/">Bites Grill and Bar</a>
(218-587-2564), which blends Minnesota comfort food with the traditions
of Spanish tapas bistros.</p>
<p>New owners Roger and Wendy Hoplin bring their industry backgrounds and
culinary skills to this building just off Minnesota 371, a cozy
north-woods haven with log beams and a corner fireplace.</p>
<p>Chef Jeff Harbert, formerly of Russell's and Grandview Lodge, brings
his own brand of creativity to the kitchen. Sample the &quot;bites&quot;-a
tiny reuben or pulled-pork tostada, for example-or larger
&quot;sharables,&quot; such as the walleye and wild rice cakes.</p>
<p>The menu also includes well-priced soups, salads, sandwiches and
entrees, from Yankee pot roast to a delectable penne dish with grilled
mahi-mahi and shiitake mushrooms in a ginger cream sauce.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pine_river_bites.jpg" alt="Dining at Bites in Pine River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Diners study the menu at Bites Grill and Bar in Pine River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>With the Paul Bunyan State Trail nudged against Bites' parking lot, the
restaurant makes a handy stop for bicyclists and snowmobilers.</p>
<p>In downtown Pine River, say hello to Kim at the <em>Cottage Café</em> , a
laid-back breakfast and lunch place.</p>
<p>Across the street is <em>JR's #19 Barbecue</em> , where Ryan serves up a
limited but tasty selection of slow-smoked specialties. On the 19th of
the month, you can get a BBQ-chicken dinner for a buck if the bill has a
&quot;19&quot; in the serial number.</p>
<h3>Merrifield</h3>
<p>If you go north from the east side of Brainerd, you can waltz your way
through Merrifield and Crosslake on the east side of Pelican Lake and
the Whitefish Chain before coming to the end of the road in Fifty Lakes.</p>
<p>From there, it's either west to Pine River or east to Emily and
Minnesota 6.</p>
<p>The venerable <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NorthwoodsInne?ref=stream">Northwoods
Inne</a></strong> in
Merrifield reopened in June 2013 with great expectations. The new
owners, local restaurant pros Bob Komischke (Manhattan Beach Lodge,
Breezy Point) and Mikey Cosert (Manhattan Beach Lodge, Norway Ridge),
bring a wealth of kitchen and dining room expertise.</p>
<p>The menu reaches back to the prime rib-and-walleye roots that the locals
fondly remember while stepping up with some nice seafood and pasta
entrees.</p>
<p>The prices should come with a lake view (they don't), but portions are
generous, and nightly and early bird special can be good values.</p>
<p>Merrifield used to have more dining options. <strong>The Woods</strong> is replacing
The Chap, a reincarnation of the former
Chaparral.</p>
<p>Farther north on County Road 3, <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/McCabesMerrifield">McCabe's Pub &amp;
Grill</a></strong> (218-765-3344),
formerly Cheek's, is a fun gathering spot for locals and tourists
alike.</p>
<h3>Crosslake</h3>
<p>On the south end of Crosslake the steady Kathy and colorful Teddy hold
forth at the <a href="http://www.cedarchestclub.com">Cedar Chest</a>
(218-692-2657). This homey spot features ribs, burgers, broaster chicken
and views of Big Pine Lake, all served with interesting conversation
that may or may not be based on facts.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><a href="http://www.maucieris.com">Maucieri's Italian Bistro and Deli</a>
(218-692-4800), rising out of a farm field on the south side of
Crosslake, is another of our favorites. Tony Maucieri has been in the
restaurant business all his life, first in Chicago and now in Crosslake,
with his daughter Dawn at his side.</p>
<p>Their previous endeavors have been compromises to the demands of the
supper-club gods, but the new Maucieri's is full-blooded Chi-talian.</p>
<p>With a big circular bar, a menu heavy on tomato &quot;gravy&quot; and hand-made
sausage, and studious, talented chef Dewey Albrecht in the kitchen, this
place is just what you would hope it would be.</p>
<p>The lack of a lake view means that you will find bargains galore,
especially with their pasta specials and the all-you-can-eat pasta bar.
With occasional entertainment on weekends the bar can be loud, so eat
early or get a tucked-away table in the rear dining room.</p>
<p>Say hello to Tony when you go in-you'll know him when you see him.</p>
<p><em>Riverside Inn</em> (218-692-3848), across from the dam in Crosslake, has
been operated by Bob and Bonnie Mudek for as long as most of us can
remember, even though their children now are taking an active role.</p>
<p>This is a comfortable spot to watch the Pine River amble past from a
dining room window or the little outside deck. The food can be pretty
good and even ambitious on occasion, while the service can be a little
confused (unless you get one of the owners' kids).</p>
<p>They can be busy for &quot;chicken night&quot; (all-you-can-eat fried chicken) and
have a popular Sunday and holiday brunch buffet.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.andyscrosslake.com/">Andy's</a></strong> (218-692-3722), in the
center of town, is handy to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers campground
across the street. With new ownership in 2013, the building and menu
both have been updated.</p>
<p>The interior is lean and clean, without frills, but it's a noticeable
upgrade from the past, and a very nice patio has been added behind the
building. The pricing hits a home run with the value-conscious locals.
Try the walleye fish and chips.</p>
<p>Next door, <em>Aunt Bea's Pantry</em> (218-692-3994) serves up an assortment of
coffees, pastries and good sandwiches in a cutesy setting.</p>
<p>Nearby <a href="http://www.pinepeakscrosslake.com">Pine Peaks Restaurant</a>
(218-692-4100) is where you will find the contractors, real-estate
agents and bankers for breakfast, and maybe again at lunch.</p>
<p>Owners Joe and Sonya Slack have parlayed wild-rice omelets and pancakes
into a thriving operation, with a substantial gift shop, mini-mall and
Pine Peaks Lodge and Suites in back. The service, provided by a
professional year-round staff, is prompt and friendly, and the food is
consistently good.</p>
<p>The recently established Town Square, around the corner and down a
couple blocks, is home to another really good <em>Rafferty's Pizza</em>
(218-692-5505), but there's little else in the way of food.</p>
<p>Going north on County Road 66 the other pizza/Mexican option is
<a href="http://www.zorbaz.com">Zorbaz</a> (218-692-4567).</p>
<p>Rafferty's is the good family pizza choice, and Zorbaz is the full-bar
option.</p>
<p>Farther north on 66, <a href="http://www.moonlitebay.com">Moonlite Bay Family
Restaurant</a> (218-692-3575) sits high on a
bluff looking back down a lovely finger of Cross Lake (the town is one
word, the lake is two).</p>
<p>Moonlite is a laid-back casual food spot whether reached by boat or car,
although the hike up the steps from the lake requires some effort.</p>
<p>The mandatory circular bar dominates the interior, which has plenty of
dining tables along the windows toward the lake. Outside dining is
picnic-table style and works with swimsuits, flip-flops and towels.</p>
<p>The &quot;Family Restaurant&quot; part of their name fits well during daylight
hours, but when the sun goes down, the kids are replaced by partying
22-year-olds, and the younger and older should be safely home in bed.</p>
<p>About a mile down County Road 16 from Moonlite is <em>The Wharf</em>
(218-692-3454). Sitting on a cozy piece of land on the Cross Lake-Rush
Lake channel, the Wharf is the Porky's Drive-In for lake-goers.</p>
<p>The outside decks or lawn seating are the spots for lounging on sunny
afternoons and evenings watching the parade of boats idle through the
no-wake channel, while the people on the boats watch you back.</p>
<p>There has been some shuffling of staff over the last years, but the menu
is kept simple enough (burgers, steaks, chicken, ribs) that there should
be no confusion. Prices are pretty steep, but there is no additional
charge for watching the boats go past.</p>
<p>Back north on County Road 66 is the <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheBourbonRoomCrosslake">Bourbon
Room</a></strong> in the
historic Ox Lake Tavern location. New owners have brought a lot of cash
and a big-city bar vibe into a quaint local 3.2 joint. The renovations
are tasteful, and the menu offers quality bar food.</p>
<p>There seems to be either too much staff or too little, so service is
inconsistent as management tries to figure out how this lake-country
hospitality scene works. Between the food, drinks and entertainment,
though, there is always something special happening, in a high-energy
atmosphere.</p>
<p>Continuing on County Road 66, you'll find <a href="http://www.mblodge.com">Manhattan Beach
Lodge</a> and <em>Manhattans Restaurant</em>
(218-692-3381). The lodge has been on an 80-year up-and-down ride, with
the latest edition being a bit of both.</p>
<p>A decade ago, the lodge was one of the most popular of the lakes-area
restaurants, but after a couple of changes of ownership, it had lost its
way.</p>
<p>With a change in the management structure in 2009, the owners seem to
finally be getting their legs beneath them. There is still a frazzled
quality to dining during busy times, but both food and service improve
dramatically off peak.</p>
<p>Oddly, Manhattans is one of the only fine-dining options open on winter
Mondays, which makes it a nice option in this small niche.</p>
<p>There is still a bit of multiple-personality disorder, as Manhattans
occasionally drifts into rock-bar mode and at other times may be closed
for an event. The staff does a good job of noting closures on the web
site, so check before going.</p>
<p>The lodge always is worth a visit for the best sunsets in Minnesota,
over Big Trout Lake, and probably a good meal.</p>
