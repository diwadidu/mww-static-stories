<h2>In Monroe, the Swiss stay true to the flavors of their forebears.</h2>

<p>In the land of Velveeta, Wonder bread and Miller Lite, a chunk of
southern Wisconsin is an Old World holdout.</p>
<p>Home of North America's last Limburger factory, Green County is the big
cheese in a state of cheese makers.</p>
<p>It's still famous for the pungent Limburger and Swiss on which it made
its reputation. It's weathered the advent of processed cheese food and
gummy white bread. It's survived the tide of bland beer and low-fat
diets.</p>
<p>In Green County, people always have gone for the gusto.</p>
<p>&quot;The old Germans and Swiss, they have to have their aged cheese, and
that's the truth,&quot; says Myron Olson, manager of Chalet Cheese Co-op
near Monroe, the county seat.</p>
<p>And sometimes, the younger ones, too.</p>
<p>&quot;I love Limburger, I always have,&quot; said John Rosa, a waiter at
Baumgartner Cheese Store and Tavern, in business in Monroe since 1931.
&quot;When I taste something, I want it to have flavor.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Limburger, whose aroma can turn heads, always has been the butt of
jokes. In 1935, a Mrs. Merle Denzler wrote this sonnet:</p>
<p>&quot;O thou, sweet Limburger, whose name</p>
<p>Has brought Green County untold fame —</p>
<p>How oft hast thy fragrance unaware</p>
<p>Brought disgrace on thee unfair!&quot;</p>
<p>At Baumgartner's, slabs of the rich, creamy cheese are served on rye,
with rings of raw onion. When I ordered it, Rosa got me to agree to a
slab of Braunschweiger on top of that.</p>
<p>&quot;Makes it so you can just see the grease running out,&quot; he said with a
straight face. &quot;If you're going to do it, do it.&quot;</p>
<p>If Monroe's splendid Court House Square is the heart of cheese country,
the adjacent Baumgartner's is its stomach. Over the door, a sign reads,
&quot;Through this portal you can get the best cheese sandwiches in the
world.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/o/monroe_bernesemountaindogs.jpg" alt="Cheese Days parade in Monroe." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Back in the bar, old-timers play Jass, a Swiss card game, occasionally
cashing in chips for sausage and cheese.</p>
<p>Locals keep Swiss folk culture alive, yodeling in a club that includes
alpenhorn players and chip carving in wood, or <em>Kerbschnitzen</em>.</p>
<p>The Turners still are going strong, though no longer as a gymnastics
club. They were meeting at the alpine-style Turner Hall when I was in
its Ratskeller, listening to Swiss music and eating bacon-and-cheese pie
and roesti potatoes, an addictive dish made with onions and aged cheese.</p>
<p>Cheese makers ply their trade all around. East of Monroe at the Maple
Leaf Cheese Factory Outlet, I tried some Monterey Jack that was much
creamier than supermarket cheese.</p>
<p>That's because cheeses sold direct are fresher and have a higher
moisture content, says Myron Olson, who was there looking at vats;
supermarkets sell drier cheese, in which acids don't break down as
quickly.</p>
<p>As cheese ages it creates acid, and connoisseurs favor the oldest,
sharpest cheeses. The mildest cheese is youngest, and it too has fans.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Every Thursday we make curds, and a number of customers make sure
they're here on Thursday morning, first thing,&quot; Olson says.</p>
<p>Four miles west of Monroe, I found the Franklin Cheese Cooperative, a
brick house to which a milk truck had pulled up; its side read &quot;You
deserve real cheese.&quot;</p>
<p>Seventeen farmers bring 50,000 pounds of milk a day to the little house,
in which Janet Gobeli and her husband, Steve, make 19 styles of
Muenster.</p>
<p>As Steve Gobeli pumped tiny curds from a hose into a steel tub, his wife
showed me around the warm, steamy room.</p>
<p>&quot;We're one of the last true coops left in the state of Wisconsin,&quot; she
said. &quot;The farmers make all the decisions, and they hire us to make
their cheese. It starts with the quality of the milk. Our farthest
farmers are only 15 miles away, and we know them all on a personal
basis. They're not just numbers to us.&quot;</p>
<p>A whisk moved through the tub, an updated version of the Swiss harp. As
the curds are heated, whey rises to the top; after it is drained, the
tiny curds are pressed into forms of different shapes, then put into a
cold salt bath.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/o/monroe_baumgartner.jpg" alt="Baumgartner's in Monroe." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On a pilgrimage to cheese country, few want to miss lunch at
Baumgartner's, on Monroe's Courthouse Square.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the cold room, Gobeli gave me a taste of onion-garlic Muenster with
basil. I bought a big brick of it, surprised by the low price.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why you should buy it direct,&quot; she said with a smile.</p>
<p>Back in Monroe, I tasted many other cheeses at Alp and Dell, where Roth
Käse claims to be the only maker of traditional Gruyere outside
Switzerland. Beyond the cheese shop, visitors can watch cheesemakers
through windows along a hallway lined with explanatory plaques, photos
and old-time equipment.</p>
<p>At Monroe's Historic Cheesemaking Center, a museum that also houses a
visitors center, I saw more old photos and equipment and realized why so
many young Green County men had well-developed muscles.</p>
<p>Cheesemakers had to push 200-pound wheels of Swiss to top shelves in
cellars to cure, and every three days they had to be taken down, washed,
placed on a clean lid and lifted back onto the shelf.</p>
<p>Near the Historic Cheesemaking Center, the rough-limestone, 47-mile
Cheese Country Trail heads west, through Browntown and Gratiot.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>To the east, the fine-limestone Sugar River State Trail links four other
Green County towns, winding 23 miles from New Glarus to Monticello,
Albany and Brodhead. And the Badger State Trail heads north to Madison
and south to the Illinois border.</p>
<p>It's a pastoral landscape of rolling green hills, dotted by tidy towns
with brick storefronts, old-fashioned squares and train depots now
devoted to bicyclists.</p>
<p>Monroe is the county seat and longtime business hub; the mail-order firm
Swiss Colony was founded there in 1926, and the town still is ringed by
cooperatives and cheese outlets.</p>
<p>With such enticements, the idyllic landscape of Green County is nearly
irresistible. Monroe's motto, &quot;We bring you back,&quot; is fitting. Tourists
do come back, again and again — usually, led by their noses.</p>
