<p>Everyone knows what people in Wisconsin like: beer, cheese and
bratwurst.</p>
<p>But they also like foie gras, frisée salad and seared pork belly.
Southern Wisconsin is a fertile quilt of artisan farms, and their
lovingly grown produce goes straight to the Dane County Farmers' Market
and the restaurants of Madison.</p>
<p>I've made a lot of delicious memories in Madison: the celeriac soup at
L'Etoile, the raspberry truffles of Candinas, the Hopalicious pale ale
from Ale Asylum.</p>
<p>One fall weekend, I made some more.</p>
<h3>The mecca</h3>
<p>On Saturday mornings, Madison is foodie paradise. More than 160 vendors
ring Capitol Square for the Dane County Farmers' Market, the largest
producer-only market in the nation.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The piles of gorgeous and exotic vegetables there made our heads spin.</p>
<p>Everything is heritage, heirloom and, of course, organic. There are
pink-and-white Borlotto shell beans, purple Viking potatoes,
green-striped Delicata squash and yellow Romanesco broccoli that looks
like jeweled coral.</p>
<p>Foragers have brought lobster and chanterelle mushrooms and a pure-white
puffball the size of a basketball: &quot;Slice it and fry it like a
steak,&quot; the vendor advised curious market-goers.</p>
<p>There are pastries and delicious-looking cheeses and meats, too. It's
frustrating to be a tourist here: We have no kitchen in which to cook
our purchases. And we have made a rookie mistake by not bringing a
cooler.</p>
<p>We allowed ourselves a freshly made buttermilk doughnut, but we
couldn't eat too much because later, we were going on a food tour.</p>
<h3>The tour</h3>
<p>Madison Food Explorers is one of two companies that offer food tours,
and we've signed up for its Downtown Lake to Lake walking tour. We
started at Monona Terrace, home of the early-winter Farmers' Market,
then walked through the State Capitol building.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_eggs_benedict.jpg" alt="Eggs Benedict from Heritage Tavern." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Off Capitol Square, Heritage Tavern upgrades a classic eggs Benedict.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Back on the square, we stopped in front of L'Etoile, co-founded in 1976
by now-famous chef Odessa Piper, the Midwestern Alice Waters.</p>
<p>Waters led the revolution in cooking with seasonal and locally sourced
ingredients and was famous for prowling the market with her red wooden
cart, piling it with choice ingredients.</p>
<p>&quot;You can still see the sous chefs of restaurants walking around with
their little carts, buying what you'll be eating tonight,&quot; our guide
told us.</p>
<p>Other farm-to-table chefs followed Piper to Capitol Square-she is
often called &quot;Pied Piper&quot;-and today, nearly every building on the
Square that's not a museum is a restaurant, cafe, coffeehouse, brewpub
or bakery.</p>
<p>A few doors away, The Old Fashioned is an updated version of the
traditional Wisconsin supper club and its signature drink, made with
Korbel brandy.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The drink may be old-fashioned, but it's still popular, said our guide,
who told us that one-third of all Korbel brandy is sold in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>That day, however, the Old Fashioned was advertising an heirloom tomato
caprese bloody Mary, made with house-infused basil vodka.</p>
<p>Our first stop for food was Heritage Tavern, whose chef raises heritage
pigs.</p>
<p>To our surprise, our guide retreated to the bar, leaving our server to
tell us what was on our plates: eggs Benedict made with shredded
porchetta, wilted spinach, herb hollandaise and hash browns fried in
duck fat. It was wonderful.</p>
<p>On the other side of the square, we sampled cheese at Fromagination.</p>
<p>&quot;We have this European-style idea that you walk in and are enveloped by
the aroma of cheese,&quot; said Pat the cheesemonger. &quot;You say what you
like, and we try to find it for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon, he had us talking like wine snobs, noting the grassy notes of an
Ocooch Mountain sheep's milk cheese and the hazelnut and caramel
flavors of a Manchego.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_beer_pitchers.jpg" alt="Drinking beer at State Street Brats." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Students hoist personal pitchers at State Street Brats.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There was more cheese at Ian's Pizza on State Street, where we split
two of its top-selling macaroni-and-cheese pizzas. We thought it was
terribly bland, though probably good for treating hangovers.</p>
<p>We had a mango lassi yogurt drink from the Nepalese restaurant Himal
Chuli, part of State Street's global lineup, then joined a tide of
young people in red sweatshirts starting their game-day festivities.</p>
<p>At State Street Brats, we squeezed onto the patio, where we were given
brats and a 10-ounce cup of Spotted Cow, the super-successful farmhouse
ale from nearby New Glarus.</p>
<p>It's a flavorful beer that's made with corn, like Miller and Bud.
Thanks to genius marketing, it's convinced legions of Wisconsin
tavern-goers not only to try craft beer, but to like it.</p>
<p>The brat, however, was so wizened and salty that I threw mine away.</p>
<p>Our last stop was the Babcock Hall Dairy Store in the Memorial Union.
It's just a nook in the basement, but this &quot;restaurant&quot; usually is
rated No. 1 on TripAdvisor. It sells sandwiches, but most people come
for the super-premium ice cream, made by the university's dairy-science
students.</p>
<p>It makes 25 flavors, but we were offered only a choice of vanilla,
chocolate or strawberry in cups. It was smooth and rich, like frozen
custard.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_pizza.jpg" alt="Ian's Pizza in Madison." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Ian's most popular pizza is the mac 'n' cheese.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Walking along State Street on a sunny day in fall never is a bad thing
to do. But if we had it to do over, we'd stop at Heritage Tavern for
those great eggs Benedict, then go sampling on our own.</p>
<p>If we wanted to know more about Madison, there are free <a href="http://tours.wisconsin.gov/pub/Content.aspx?p=Capitol%20Tour">State Capitol
tours</a>,
and <a href="http://www.madisonpreservation.org/tours/">Madison Trust for Historic
Preservation</a> walking tours
that cost $10.</p>
<p>That would give us more time-and money-to do some serious
eating.</p>
<h3>The restaurant</h3>
<p>Not all of the great restaurants in Madison are around Capitol Square or
along State Street. Since we were staying a block off Monroe Street,
just south of the football stadium, we ate at a neighborhood place
called Brasserie V.</p>
<p>It's a European-style bistro, but it uses local ingredients. In fact,
it was offering a special of roast pork with butternut squash and
lobster mushrooms that was almost identical to a dish offered the same
night at L'Etoile, but without the pork and for twice as much.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I ordered a savory cup of sweet-corn soup and the mussels and truffle
frites. The mussels were on the small side, but the crispy fries, served
with curry and classic aioli, were addictive.</p>
<p>The restaurant is known for its extensive, Belgian-heavy beer list. It
doesn't have many from Wisconsin, but I got the Really Cool Waterslides
from 3 Sheeps Brewing in Sheboygan, a nice piney IPA.</p>
<p>The next day, I returned for more of that fantastic sweet-corn soup, and
I added a generously sized Belgian endive salad with frisée lettuce,
crumbled egg, apple, almond and warm bacon. My tab was $12, surely one
of the best deals in Madison.</p>
<h3>The diner</h3>
<p>We'd noticed the lines outside Mickies Dairy Bar on Monroe, a hole in
the wall that has fed students since 1947. But we never managed to get
there before its 2:30 p.m. closing time.</p>
<p>Next, we tried Dotty Dumpling's Dowry, which looked way too upscale for
a diner but had some great-sounding burgers on its menu.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_old_fashioned.jpg" alt="The Old Fashioned on Capitol Square." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Capitol Square, The Old Fashioned pays tribute to Wisconsin's
supper-club tradition.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Alas, there was a long line, so we went around the corner to Vintage
Spirits &amp; Grill, where we nabbed a table on the patio and had a decent
pulled-pork sandwich and a glass of Vintage Brewing's Woodshed IPA.</p>
<p>For dessert, we went back at State Street and had a dish of gelato at La
Coppa, which is not far from Chocolate Shoppe Ice Cream, another popular
local company that doesn't stint on fat or flavor.</p>
<p>In Madison, the choice is endless. The challenge is bringing an appetite
to match.</p>
