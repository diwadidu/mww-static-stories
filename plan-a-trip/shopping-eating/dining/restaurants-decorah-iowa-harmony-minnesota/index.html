<h2>On a culinary adventure to Decorah, we tighten our belts, then let them out.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_downtown.jpg" alt="Downtown Decorah." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In downtown Decorah, Water Street is lined by family-owned businesses
and anchored by Vesterheim Norwegian-American Museum.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Sometimes, we like to travel like kings . . . and paupers, too.</p>
<p>I suspect a lot of other people do the same thing. To get what we want,
we save on something else.</p>
<p>Our favorite splurge is eating out, but a meal for two in a really good
restaurant costs $80-$100, same as a hotel room. Our solution? We
pitch a tent.</p>
<p>In early October one year, we headed for the scenic bluffs of northeast
Iowa, a hotbed of locavore chefs and artisan farmers as well as artists
and musicians.</p>
<p>We had a lot to do around Decorah: Browse at the Northeast Iowa Artists'
Studio Tour, go to the Harvest Festival at Seed Savers Exchange and ride
our bicycles on the art-lined Trout Run Trail. And eat, of course.</p>
<p>Our first stop was near the Iowa border at QUARTER/quarter Restaurant &amp;
Wine Bar, in Harmony. Named for the smallest homestead in frontier
America, 40 acres, it was run by chef Stephen Larson and his pastry
chef/farmer wife, Lisa Flicker.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We ordered the three-course dinner, and we both chose the pizza rustica,
beef tenderloin with chicken of the woods mushrooms from the couple's
farm and Italian carrot cake.</p>
<p>&quot;You get all this for $23?&quot; said my husband, Torsten. &quot;People from New
York probably would think, 'What is this?' &quot;</p>
<p>With two beers, our bill was possibly the best dining deal in the region
-you can tell because even the local Amish occasionally come in for a
meal.</p>
<p>From Harmony, it's just 45 minutes to Decorah, where we set up our tent
at the city-owned Pulpit Rock Campground.</p>
<p>We didn't feel too deprived by camping, because the setting was
gorgeous, framed by bluffs on one side and the Upper Iowa River and Twin
Springs Creek, a trout stream, on the others.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_pulpit_rock_tent.jpg" alt="A campsite on the Upper Iowa River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Decorah's municipal campground, tent sites are right on the Upper
Iowa River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the morning, we went to <a href="https://mymagpiecoffee.com/"><strong>Café
Magpie</strong></a> on Winnebago Street, which was
packed and had an interesting college/townie vibe. We got a table near
the picture window to eat our frittata, ciabatta egg sandwich,
fresh-berry muffin, hot chocolate and mocha.</p>
<p>We just missed the nearby <a href="http://www.winneshiekfarmersmarket.com">Winneshiek Farmers
Market</a>, so we went straight to
the annual artists' tour, starting with Gene and Sandy Somdahl's
pottery and fiber studio.</p>
<p>The ridges and valleys around Decorah are a magnet for artists and
musicians, especially Norwegian ones, who are drawn by the cultural
amenities provided by Luther College.</p>
<p>&quot;We liked coming down here, so we retired here,&quot; said Gene, a member of
Decorah's Luren Singers. &quot;Lots of us retired here. Lutheran ministers
are like boxelder bugs; they're everywhere, but they don't hurt
anyone.&quot;</p>
<p>From there, we drove north of town to the Harvest Festival at <a href="http://www.seedsavers.org/">Seed
Savers Exchange</a>, which preserves heirloom
seeds at its bucolic farm in the bluffs. There was a lot to sample: bean
dip, apple crisp, fried kale leaves and apple cider, fresh from a hand
press.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Local chefs were competing in a soup contest, which QUARTER/quarter chef
Stephen Larson won with a soup made from heirloom Kilimanjaro speckled
beans, garnet sweet potatoes, white yams and coconut milk.</p>
<p>Deep-purple morning glories twined up the sides of the red barn, and
heritage poultry roamed its yard-velvety black ducks and chickens
with fluffy black-and-white &quot;hats.&quot;</p>
<p>Children were rolling pumpkins down a hill, and everyone had rosy
cheeks; it's the kind of place where you feel healthy just being
there.</p>
<p>In the visitors center, where few can resist the colorful packets of
heirloom seeds, artist Gena Ollendieck was showing wonderfully clever
collages made with old typewriter keys, handwritten letters and tin cut
from old cans thrown into the gullies near her house.</p>
<p>I craved one called &quot;The Joy of It All,&quot; but it was $2,500, too
much for a part-time pauper.</p>
<p>It must be hard to be an artist. As we left, we were amused to hear a
visitor say, &quot;It's not anything I couldn't do myself, but I'm not
that good yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Back at the campground, we set off on our bikes on the Trout Run Trail,
which circles the north end of town along the Upper Iowa River, then
closes the loop while following Trout Run Creek.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_oneota_sculpture.jpg" alt="Sculpture on the Trout Run Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The oldest part of Trout Run Trail is along the Upper Iowa River, below
Phelps Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was extraordinarily lovely, lined with sculptures, wildflowers,
bluffs and burbling water. We passed a bowstring trestle bridge that was
moved next to the trail to serve as a picnic pavilion, then the fish
hatchery where the famous Decorah bald eagles nest.</p>
<p>And then we starting climbing switchbacks, winding back and forth like
Christmas ribbon candy, then up to an overlook, across Iowa 9 on a
lighted bridge and through a cut through a limestone bluff.</p>
<p>We'd earned another nice dinner. Decorah has a lot of good restaurants,
including <em>La Rana Bistro</em> , a classy little nook off Water Street that
we love.</p>
<p>This time, we ate in the larger and fancier <em>Rubaiyat</em> , which,
befitting a college town, advertises &quot;food for thought&quot; and is named
after the classic Persian ruminations on life.</p>
<p>The dining room behind the 1890s storefront, with exposed-brick walls
and pressed-tin ceiling, was buzzing with animated conversations; this
is a well-educated town, and there's a lot to talk about.</p>
<p>I was drawn by the 34 taps lined up at the bar. I chose from Toppling
Goliath, Decorah's own microbrewery-first the Golden Nugget IPA,
then the Tsunami Pale Ale.</p>
<p>For dinner, I had the duck with cherry glaze, two plump leg quarters
that came with a Caesar salad. Torsten had black-bean soup and turkey
pumpkin ravioli with walnuts and cranberries in a blue cheese sauce:
&quot;It tastes like fall,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>From the dessert tray-and who can resist that?-we chose a
chocolate Bundt cake with a caramel center.</p>
<p>By the end of the meal, we were almost cross-eyed from eating so much
rich food.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_soup_sampling.jpg" alt="Chef Stephen Larson at Seed Savers." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the morning, we went back to Water Street and had breakfast at the
sun-filled <a href="https://javajohnscoffeehouse.com/"><strong>Java John's</strong></a> : hot
chocolate, milk, two muffin tops and a cinnamon roll.</p>
<p>Then we drove out to the rural 1914 Norwegian old folks' home that now
houses the studio of Dean Schwarz, one of the grand old men of ceramics.
His works are in museum collections around the world, and Torsten fell
in love with a $500 bowl shaped like a tricorn hat.</p>
<p>&quot;The longer I was in there, the more it didn't seem like very much
money, really,&quot; he said wistfully after we left. He should have
bought it, because he's still talking about it.</p>
<p>To work off calories, I had Torsten drop me off at the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/blufflands/harmony_preston.html">Harmony-Preston
Valley State
Trail</a>, and I rode the 12 miles into Preston.</p>
<p>So what if it's mostly downhill from Harmony? I'm sure I worked off
the hot chocolate, at least.</p>
