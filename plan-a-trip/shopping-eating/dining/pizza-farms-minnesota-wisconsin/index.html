<h2>In Wisconsin and Minnesota, dinner guests flock to the countryside for ultra-fresh ingredients and idyllic settings.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pizza_ordering.jpg" alt="Ordering pizza at A to Z." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Guests try to decide on a pizza from the blackboard menu at A to Z.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>You can't get more local and sustainable than a wood-fired pizza served
just yards from where its ingredients were raised and grown.</p>
<p>Farms that moonlight as pizzerias one or two nights a week are
multiplying, but not just because the pizzas are so good.</p>
<p>The visitors who eat them also get to spend an evening soaking up the
bucolic country atmosphere, savoring a lifestyle that's now far removed
from most lives.</p>
<p>Children tear around expansive lawns, adults chat over chilled wine, and
the scent of lilacs and freshly mowed grass wafts through the air.
Often, there's live music.</p>
<p>We visited our first pizza farm on a golden Friday evening in early May.
Driving up the Mississippi River bluffs east of Alma, Wis., then on
silent country roads through the vestigial village of Cream, we felt a
stab of doubt: Does this place really exist?</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Oasis in the uplands</h3>
<p>Then we pulled into the lane leading to Suncrest Gardens Farms and, like
magic, cars appeared — a lot of cars. Small groups of people were
scattered all over the grounds, on blankets and in lawn chairs.</p>
<p>Children climbed on wooden cable spools and a play fort. Pygmy goat kids
bounced like puppies along the edge of a chicken yard.</p>
<p>We got in the long line to order pizza, then settled at a picnic table
under a little pavilion. Drinking a New Glarus Moon Man ale and Sprecher
orange soda, we relaxed and waited.</p>
<p>It was hypnotizing, watching dusk settle on the hazy bluffs lining the
valley and listening to a pleasant mix of recorded roots music. Behind
us, a llama wandered on a rocky hillock.</p>
<p>Our pizza — ham, pineapple, garlic and onion, hold the jalapeno —
was one of the last of 126 made that night, and we followed it with
homemade chocolate-chip cookies, $1.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pizza_wine.jpg" alt="Wine and beer at a pizza farm." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
There's a wide selection of wine and beer at A to Z.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It wasn't quite asparagus season yet, but coming soon was a pizza with
roasted balsamic asparagus, tomatoes, chives, feta, roasted onions,
garlic and mozzarella. In summer, roasted sweet corn and sweet peppers
appear on pizzas.</p>
<p>It was hard to leave, and we envied farmer Heather Secrist her idyllic
patch of countryside. Maybe someday, she'll put in a few B&amp;B rooms,
too.</p>
<h3>High above Lake Pepin</h3>
<p>Our next stop also was in a beautiful place, but it was all about the
pizza.</p>
<p>Four miles up the bluff from the tiny Lake Pepin village of Stockholm,
Wis., A to Z Produce and Bakery has been making pizzas since 1998.
Because it's so well-known, and only an hour from the east edge of the
Twin Cities, it's packed on warm summer nights.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But driving there on a Tuesday in May, we again felt like the only
people around. And since there were no signs to help us, we wondered if
we were in the right place until we rounded some lilac bushes and saw
parked cars.</p>
<p>As memorable as Suncrest Gardens' setting was, so was the pizza at A to
Z. My friend Jean and I wanted different pizzas, and we dithered until
finally we were offered half Italian sausage and olives and half
cilantro pesto with roasted tomatoes and red onion.</p>
<p>We'd barely had time to set up our table and chairs in a spruce-lined
copse before our pizza was pulled out of the brick oven and ready for
us.</p>
<p>Jean's sausage came in knobs and tasted of pig. My cilantro pesto sat
in thick smears amid molten slabs of mozzarella, dotted by sweet chunks
of tomato.</p>
<p>It was heavenly, the pizza-farm pizza of my dreams.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stockholm_pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza at A to Z near Stockholm." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
This is the cilantro pesto/Italian sausage with olives pizza from A to
Z.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At A to Z, guests can hang around a covered pavilion, watching pizzas go
in and out of two ovens, or wander past picturesque outbuildings and
through fields.</p>
<p>When we were there, we heard claps of thunder in the distance, and we
could see a rainstorm pelting the other end of the valley, but all we
got was a double rainbow.</p>
<p>It was a little less hard to leave A to Z, because now I know that each
pizza farm offers something different.</p>
<p>You could spend a whole summer visiting them. In fact, that seems like
an excellent idea.</p>
<h3>What to know</h3>
<p>Some pizza farms <strong>require reservations and may limit the number of
guests. Check before you go.</strong></p>
<p>Bring plates, napkins, chairs or blanket, bug repellent and, if you
want, utensils, glasses and a yard game. Don't bring pets, because of
the farm animals, and carry-in alcohol usually is not allowed.</p>
<p>To get a little fancier, bring a table, a tablecloth and an ice bucket
to keep your wine or beer cold. We even saw one pair who had brought a
vase of flowers.</p>
<p>Pizzas generally cost $20-$30, tax included, and can feed two or
three. If you can't decide, ask if you can get half of one kind and
half of another.</p>

Diners bring their own tables at A to Z.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Wood-fired pizzas take only five minutes to bake, but waits lengthen
when there are a lot of people.</p>
<p>Bring extra cash to buy the produce, eggs, baked goods, jams and plants
that many farms also offer.</p>
