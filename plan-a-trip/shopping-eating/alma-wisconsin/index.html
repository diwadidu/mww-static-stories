<h2>Birds and bird's-eye views</h2>
<p>IMG:RIGHT</p>
<p>One of great views.</p>
<p>In Alma, life revolves around river. Eagles, tundra swans, views, fish, boating.</p>
<p>Karen � neat. Birding�s pretty good, too. There�s been an oriole flying in and out of this tree. Vireo, yellow-bellied sapsucker, flicker. All kinds of things aer going on here. This is great habitat. Willows, maple, spruce.</p>
<p>Fire &amp; Ice, Mississippi River Pearl, Empire Room restaurant.</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>On north side of town, two bald eagles in a dead tree. Then six egrets on Rieck�s Lake, two fishermen in boats.</p>
<p>A 90-year-old man wearing a red cardigan and ``old-age combat hat'' sat in a wheelchair 500 feet above Alma, looking down at the river winding past the Wisconsin town.</p>
<p>``Beautiful, isn't it,'' he commented. ``We just saw a couple of eagles fly by, bald ones. And see those islands over there? I love them.''</p>
<p>In the distance was Lock and Dam 4 and the wide river plain, broken by the channels and long clumps of green that mark the beginning of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge, stretching all the way to Rock Island, Ill. But Ray Studer hadn't come all the way from St. Cloud to give any fish refuge.</p>
<p>``We were up here two years ago and saw that F-shaped fishing dock over there,'' said his daughter, Rosanne Healey. ``Dad's been talking about it ever since.''</p>
<p>Alma has a handicapped-accessible municipal dock, off Beach Harbor Road between Rieck's Park and downtown. But Studer planned to fish from the Great Alma Fish Float across the river, which fetches people and lets them fish all day on the float, which has a cafe and bait and tackle shop.</p>
<p>The bird's-eye view from Buena Vista Park, two miles up by road, is the pride of Alma, pronounced EL-ma by locals. The town is attractive, too, though it only has two streets: storefronts along Highway 35 and houses backed into the bluff behind it. All of them are on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>Alma was founded by Swiss immigrants in 1848, and until recent, tourists could sample rouladen, geschnetzeltes and roesti in its restaurants.</p>
<p>The 1868 building that now houses the Fire &amp; Ice coffee and ice-cream shop once was a winery operated by the Huber brothers of Switzerland. In the 1880s, they shipped in 45 barrels of California grapes a week by rail.</p>
<p>Now, its owners sell ice cream, rent rooms and cultivate a back patio carved into the bluff, its rocky terraces planted with hosta, phlox and ferns and its floor with white deck chairs and a pillowed bench.</p>
<p>It's a kind of remnant of the town he knew in his teens.</p>
<p>``Alma used to have very narrow streets with lots of trees,'' he said. ``It used to be that everywhere there were nooks and crannies in rock walls, things you discovered.'' Then the highway was widened and the town's look changed, though not its character.</p>
<p>``It still has that rough edge of a river town,'' he said. ``People come to fish, hunt and drink. They're not going to chi-chi it up here too much.''</p>
