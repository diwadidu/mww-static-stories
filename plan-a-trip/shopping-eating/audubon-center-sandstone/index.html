<p>At Audubon Center, families go frisking through the forest</p>
<p>On the shores of Grindstone Lake, a small retreat is filled with wondrous things. There's a Mongolian yurt near a burbling creek and a one-eyed screech owl with a swiveling head. There's a meadow full of milkweed pods and a rare stand of white pines.</p>
<p>Add a bicycle ride through bronzed oaks and basalt, top it with banana splits, and you've got quite a weekend.</p>
<p>The fall family weekend at Audubon Center of the North Woods this year was a celebration of the outdoors, featuring a ride to Duluth along the Munger State Trail, a tour of the raptor barn and a scavenger hunt in the woods around the Sandstone campus.</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>During the week, Audubon and the other environmental-learning centers in Minnesota are buzzing with schoolchildren and teachers. But on occasional weekends, they open their doors to families, too, who come to enjoy an inexpensive but non-rustic retreat.</p>
<p>``This is the first bicycle trip where I haven't had to set up the tent, sleep on the ground and cook over the fire, so this is real luxury to me,'' said Joan Buller of Roseville, who came with her husband, Dana Donatucci, and two sons, Daniel and David.</p>
<p>My two children and I got to know the other four families after a dinner of roast chicken and mashed potatoes, when we gathered to play get-acquainted bingo. Then we had banana splits in the great room before going back to our rooms in the residence hall, lined by floor-to-ceiling murals of local life, from the Dakota and Ojibwe to the arrival of the fur-traders and loggers and the cataclysmic Hinckley Fire of 1894.</p>
<p>The next morning, we loaded our bikes onto shuttle vans, which took us to various points along the Munger, which stretches 70 miles from Hinckley to Duluth. Joan and I and our children started in Friesland, five miles north of Hinckley, so we could pass Skunk Lake, actually a weed-choked bog that was the site of a famous rescue in 1894. As a 4{1/2}-mile-high cyclone of fire arrived in Hinckley from the south, St. Paul &amp; Duluth engineer Jim Root arrived from the north. As his train burned, Root backed it to the lake, where nearly 300 people huddled in 18 inches of slime as the fire passed over them and, a few minutes later, obliterated Sandstone.</p>
<p>From Skunk Lake, we cruised down a corridor of color, provided by burgundy oaks and golden aspen, their round leaves quivering in the breeze. In Willow River, 18 miles later, we had a picnic lunch and loaded our bikes again for the ride to Carlton. From there, we rode toward Jay Cooke State Park, stopping to climb down from a trestle bridge and skip rocks on the furious, horehound-colored waters of the St. Louis River.</p>
<p>The 14 miles into Duluth, a gradual downhill, is one of the best rides in the state, passing between sheer basalt outcroppings and following the river and the site of John Jacob Astor's 1817 fur-trade post, where the St. Louis flows into Lake Superior. From the end of the trail, Audubon staff took us through Duluth to Park Point, at the other end of St. Louis Bay near the Superior harbor entry.</p>
<p>As dusk fell, the children played soccer, the staff grilled hamburgers and director Mike Link told us how Duluthians snatched the bulk of harbor traffic from Superior in 1871, taking up shovels and digging their own ship canal. Then it was back to Audubon for butterscotch bars and more banana splits.</p>
<p>The next morning, intern naturalist Amy Chang introduced us to the raptors -- a broad-winged hawk, found wandering the streets of St. Paul with jewelry glued to its beak; a bald eagle who shattered a wing as a chick, when its nest was blown over in a storm; and the tiny screech owl. Then we went on a scavenger hunt in the woods, using compasses to find 20 stations that asked, ``Why is the birch's bark white?'' and ``How many gallons of sap does it take to make a gallon of maple syrup?'' It was amazing how much we didn't know. By the time we found the last station, where we tasted pine-needle tea out of a thermos, it was time to have lunch and pack.</p>
<p>At Audubon, each family camp is different. In the spring, guests make syrup. In the summer, they swim and canoe. Last fall, the family camp featured the center's climbing wall, a visit to the North West Fur Post in nearby Pine City and, in the evening, ceili dancing.</p>
<p>``It was a blast,'' says Karen Marondo of Falcon Heights, who returned for this year's camp. ``We had so much fun.''</p>
<p>Each of the environmental-learning centers offers special attractions, in addition to nature trails, climbing walls and treetop ropes courses. At Eagle Bluff near Lanesboro, family weekends include Saturday-night concerts by touring musicians, tours of the shiitake-mushroom operation and cuisine that includes wine, hors d'oeuvres and such dishes as prime rib, shrimp and chocolate torte. The food, says education coordinator Sharon Kaufman, helps the center snare the musicians.</p>
<p>``It's fancier than maybe it should be, but it's so popular, and so high-quality, that I'm not going to complain,'' she says with a laugh. ``Though I almost feel guilty.''</p>
<p>At Deep Portage, in lake country east of Hackensack, the cedar-sided great hall is built in chalet style, with birch trim inside and a huge fieldstone fireplace. The preserve has 12 lakes, miles of ski trails and, says director Dale Yerger, is ``crawling with wild animals -- wolves, moose, bear, bobcat and fisher, as well as all the usual suspects.''</p>
<p>The campus of Wolf Ridge, near Finland on the North Shore, includes two lakes, two gentle mountains and a river on a ridge overlooking Lake Superior. Evening programs include a variety show and folk dance, with musicians and a caller from Duluth. Laurentian, on a lake in the boreal forest north of Virginia, is more rustic, but has a wood-fired sauna and its own sled dogs, from whom guests learn the rudiments of mushing.</p>
<p>These centers, funded primarily by the Legislature and also by private and corporate donors, such as the Blandin Foundation, are a tremendous resource for Minnesotans of all ages. And in addition to providing fun, music and banana splits, they also inspire people to become stewards of the environment.</p>
<p>``We want to reach people at different ages in their lifetime,'' says Sue Hankner, director of Laurentian, which holds camps for seniors as well as students and families. ``Teaching the children is just not enough.''</p>
