<h2>No money, no problem: Here are 20 great vacations that are easy on the wallet.</h2>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In summer, it's not as hard as you'd think to take a trip that's a lot
of fun but doesn't cost much.</p>
<p>Many of the great travel experiences in Wisconsin can't be bought,
anyway — bicycling along Lake Michigan, camping on sandbars,
volunteering in a lighthouse.</p>
<p>If you like music and festivals, you're really in luck — Wisconsin
has many fun, family-friendly fests with on-site camping, at unbeatable
prices. And its national forests and county parks are full of great
campsites.</p>
<p>Here's our list of the best cheap trips, most for less than
$100 per person.</p>
<p>Most give you a roof over your head; the trips that require tent camping
also include guides, meals and/or fun things to do.</p>

Minnesota</a>.</p>

<h2>Music and camping</h2>
<p>Camping at a music festival is a time-honored way to have fun on a
budget, although some of the bigger fests can get pretty rowdy. Here are
some lower-key fests that are especially family-friendly.</p>
<p>For more, check our <a href="/events/">Events Calendar</a>.</p>
<h3>Music in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Trempealeau</a></h3>
<p>The Trempealeau Hotel in this little hamlet on the Mississippi is known
for its Reggae Fest the first weekend of June. It also offers <a href="https://www.trempealeauhotel.com/event/">live
music</a> on weekends and
sometimes during the week.</p>
<p>You can camp up the street in <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/perrot/">Perrot State
Park</a> or stay in one of the
hotel's <a href="https://www.trempealeauhotel.com/lodging/historic-hotel-rooms/">old-fashioned
rooms</a>
with shared bath for $50-$70.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/o/solon_springs_concert.jpg" alt="A crowd listens to an outdoor blues concert in Solon Springs" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Solon Springs, camp and see a concert in the same place.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Summer in Solon Springs</h3>
<p>On the shores of Upper St. Croix Lake, headwaters of the St. Croix
River, the Lucius Woods Performing Arts Center offers <a href="http://www.lwmusic.org/concert-schedule/">Music in the
Park</a> on Saturday evenings in
July and early August at its massive log bandshell.</p>
<p>It's on the lake in <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/campgrounds/lucius-woods-county-park-199251">Lucius Woods County
Park</a>, which has 24 wooded sites, a nice sand beach, a playground and a
modern bathhouse. Camping costs $15-$18 and is first-come,
first-served.</p>
<p>Music includes folk, blues, big-band, bluegrass, Dixieland jazz, Celtic
and '50s classics. Tickets are $15 in advance, $20 at the gate, free
for children 15 and under. Brats and beer are sold on site.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/theater-music/solon-springs-wisconsin/">Summer nights in Solon
Springs</a>.</p>
<h3>Sweet corn in the coulees</h3>
<p>On a maple-syrup farm in the gorgeous coulees of southwest Wisconsin,
between Ontario and La Farge, the Kickapoo Valley Acoustic Music
Association
sponsors <a href="https://www.kvama.org/">Larryfest</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's <em>Aug. 18-20</em> in 2022 and cost of $150 includes more than 20
performances, camping, sweet corn, firewood and shuttle bus. Food and
soda, but no alcoholic beverages, are sold on the grounds.</p>
<p>For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/vernon-county-wisconsin/">Valleys of Vernon
County</a>.</p>
<h3>Big-name bands in the bluffs</h3>
<p>In the bluffs above the Mississippi River, half an hour north of Winona,
Minn., Train, Brantley Gilbert, Cole Swindell and Brooks &amp; Dunn headline the <a href="http://www.ashleyforthearts.com/">Ashley for the Arts</a>
music festival, <em>Aug. 11-13</em> in 2022 in Arcadia.</p>
<p>Tickets are only $35 for all three days. In addition to music, there
will be a hot-air balloon launch, lumberjack show, arts and crafts fair and children's
activities.</p>
<p>There's no camping on-site, but <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PietrekPark/">Joe Pietrek Jr. County
Park</a> is five miles
north on the Trempealeau River, and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/trempealeau-trails/">Trempealeau</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/cruises-in-lacrosse/">La Crosse</a> are
nearby.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/wisconsin_river_paddlers.jpg" alt="Paddling the Wisconsin River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
With placid water and abundant sandbars, the Wisconsin River is perfect
for paddling and camping.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h2>Paddling</h2>
<h3><strong>Canoeing</strong> on the Namekagon</h3>
<p>Flowing out of Hayward, the Namekagon River is part of the St. Croix
National Scenic Riverway. It's great for paddling and also for
swimming, because its waters are spring-fed and as clear as glass.</p>
<p>Camping is free and first-come, first-served. Try the quiet section
between Trego and the St. Croix River. If you need an outfitter, contact
<a href="http://www.pardunscanoerental.com/">Pardun's Canoe Rental and Shuttle
Service</a> in Danbury.</p>
<h3>Sandbar camping on the Wisconsin</h3>
<p>People who like to paddle and camp love the Wisconsin River toward the
middle of summer, when its many sandbars start to appear. Sites are
first-come, first-served.</p>
<p>You can outfit yourself and arrange for your own shuttle, or go through
the <a href="https://thebestcanoecompanyever.com/">Wisconsin Canoe Company</a>,
based in Spring Green.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on water levels and brewing storms. <a href="https://www.milespaddled.com/canoe-kayak-camping-wisconsin-lower-wisconsin-river/">Miles
Paddled</a>
has lots of great information for first-time canoe-campers on the river.</p>
<h2>Bicycling</h2>
<p>An organized bicycle tour is a great way to see the countryside and make
a lot of friends, too. Many of the best are fund-raising rides, and if
you raise the minimum, you pay only the registration fee.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Following Lake Michigan</h3>
<p>The annual <a href="https://wisconsinbikefed.org/events/scenic-shore-bike-tour/">Scenic Shore
150</a> follows Lake
Michigan from Mequon, just north of Milwaukee, to Potowatomi State Park
in Sturgeon Bay, with an overnight in Manitowoc.</p>
<p>The route includes three trails, the Interurban from Mequon to Belgium
and the Mariners and Rawley Point trails between Manitowoc and Point
Beach State Forest.</p>
<p>It's <em><strong>July 23-24</strong></em> in 2022. The
ride benefits the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.</p>
<p>For more rides, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/bicycle-tours-trips/">Sightseeing by bicycle</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/weekend-bicycle-trips/">Tours on two
wheels</a>.</p>
<h2>Camping</h2>
<h3>Park and ride on the edge of Madison</h3>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with the one-way streets around Madison's Capitol
Square (and the towing rules), you can camp for cheap on the edge of
town, surrounded by trees and flowers, and ride your bike into town.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_bicycle_fishing.jpg" alt="Bicycling along Madison's Lake Monona." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From campgrounds, bicyclists can ride all around Madison.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The 17-mile <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/capcity/">Capital City State
Trail</a> runs through <a href="https://parks-lwrd.countyofdane.com/park/LakeFarm">Lake
Farm County Park</a> in
the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/capsprings/">Capital Springs State Recreation
Area</a>, which has a
campground with a nice  shower house.</p>
<p>From there, you can ride west all the way to Dodgeville; the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/militaryridge/">Military
Ridge State Trail</a>
starts where the Capital City ends.</p>
<p>On the west side of town, near <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/govnelson/">Governor Nelson State
Park</a>, you can camp on
the shores of Lake Mendota at the county-run <a href="https://parks-lwrd.countyofdane.com/park/Mendota">Mendota
Park</a>. All of the
sites are electric, and there's a shower house and swimming area.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-summer-madison-wisconsin/">Summer in
Madison</a>.</p>
<h3>Walking around Geneva Lake</h3>
<p>In the tony Lake Geneva area of southeast Wisconsin, you can't put a
roof over your head for less than $125. But you can have one of the
best locations if you camp at <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/bigfoot/">Big Foot Beach State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>It's right on Geneva Lake in Fontana, with a quarter-mile sand beach.
The campground has showers; 38 sites can be reserved and 37 are
first-come, first-served.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_geneva_stroll.jpg" alt="Walking around Geneva Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Lake Geneva, camp just off the famous lakeshore path.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>You can swim, but the thing to do is walk around the lake on a unusual
footpath that goes right through the front yards of the big mansions.
It's 20 miles, but you also can walk to the town of Lake Geneva and get
a ride back to Fontana on a <a href="https://www.cruiselakegeneva.com/">Lake Geneva Cruise
Line</a> boat.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/walking-lake-geneva/">Gawking in Lake
Geneva</a>.</p>
<h3>On the shore of Lake Superior</h3>
<p>I found <a href="https://ironcountyforest.org/saxon-harbor-campground-marina/">Saxon Harbor County
Park</a> on Lake
Superior while seeking out nearby Superior Falls, on the Montreal River
between Wisconsin and Michigan. It has everything anyone wants in summer
— a sand beach for swimming, showers, a protected bay for kayaking and
a bar that serves burgers and pizza on days when it's too hot to cook.</p>
<p>It's one of our <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/great-campsites-midwest/">30 great
campsites</a>.</p>
<h2>Cabins</h2>
<h3>Cabin in waterfall country</h3>
<p>Wisconsin state parks don't have camper cabins by state statute, but
national forests can have them.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_dorm.jpg" alt="Marquette University's Straz Tower dorm." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Marquette's Straz Tower provides dorm rooms on the edge of downtown
Milwaukee.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the waterfall country of northeast Wisconsin, an hour east of Eagle
River and 20 minutes west of Florence, <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/cnnf/">Chequamegon-Nicolet National
Forest</a> rents eight <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/cnnf/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=27877&amp;actid=101">Lost Lake
Cabins</a>
at Lost Lake Campground.</p>
<p>The cabins sleep six in three bunk beds, and bathrooms and showers are
in two central buildings. They rent for $40 weekdays, $45 weekends,
and they're open from mid-May to mid-October. Reserve at
<a href="http://www.recreation.gov/">Recreation.Gov</a>.</p>
<h3>Cabins for the physically disabled</h3>
<p>If you're physically disabled, Wisconsin charges just $30 per night
for <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/camping/cabin.html">accessible cabins in 10 state
parks</a>. Of course,
they're very popular.</p>
<p>Modern cabins are in Buckhorn, Harrington Beach, High Cliff, Mirror
Lake, Kohler-Andrae and Potawatomi state parks and at Ottawa Lake in the
Southern Unit of Kettle Moraine State Forest and in Richard Bong
Recreation Area.</p>
<p>Rustic cabins are at Copper Falls and Blue Mounds state parks.
Reservations for each calendar year are taken starting Jan. 10 by
individual parks.</p>
<h3>On the Lake Michigan beach</h3>
<p>Do you have a really large family and hardly any money but would like a
nice beach vacation? Here's the place for you.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_rivers_ketchbaw_cabin.jpg" alt="A cabin in Point Beach State Forest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Point Beach State Forest, the Ketchbaw Cabin has its own boardwalk to
the Lake Michigan beach.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Just north of Two Rivers, Wis., <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/pointbeach/">Point Beach State
Forest</a> rents an
&quot;indoor group camp&quot; that includes two rustic cabins, each with a
boardwalk to white-sand beach on Lake Michigan. They're in their own
part of the park, south of the lighthouse and main beach, so they're
very quiet.</p>
<p>Guests should bring bicycles and ride the beautiful Rawley Point Trail
through the park to the lighthouse and south to Two Rivers, where they
can connect to the paved Mariners Trail, which follows the Lake Michigan
shoreline to Manitowoc.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/two-rivers-manitowoc/">Two trails from Two
Rivers</a>.</p>
<p>One cabin sleeps 14 in bunks and the other sleeps 16, but they're all
in one room, so beware of snorers. Each has a fire pit and latrine, and
they share a covered pavilion for eating and a water pump. There's no
electricity, so campers should bring lanterns. Shower houses are in the
main part of the park. Cost is $60.</p>
<p>They can be <a href="https://wisconsin.goingtocamp.com/">reserved</a> 11 months in
advance, 888-947-2757. The park is at 920-794-7480.</p>
<h3>Camping near Laura's house</h3>
<p>Children's-book heroines Laura Ingalls Wilder and Caddie Woodlawn grew
up in the bluffs above Lake Pepin, where you can rent an air-conditioned
cabin at <a href="https://www.co.pierce.wi.us/departments/nugget_lake/index.php">Nugget Lake County
Park</a>
near Plum City.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/downsville_caddie_house.jpg" alt="The Caddie Woodlawn house near Downsville, Wis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 1856 house where the heroine of "Caddie Woodlawn" lived is near
Downsville.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>They're $70 (or camp for $25), plus $6 reservation fee and $5
entrance fee. In the park, there are canoe and kayak rentals, fishing,
naturalist programs and nature movies in an amphitheater.</p>
<p>There are more fun things to do nearby, especially for kids, including
touring Crystal Cave and visiting the log-house replica of Laura's
house near Pepin and Caddie's real house near Downsville.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/western-wisconsin-kids/">In Caddie and Laura's back
yard</a>.</p>
<h2>Hostels and dorms</h2>
<h3>Party in Milwaukee</h3>
<p>Summer is one big party in Milwaukee, whose lakefront festival grounds
host the huge Summerfest and eight big heritage festivals.</p>
<p>Ignore the expensive hotel rooms and bunk at <a href="http://www.marquette.edu/orl/conference/summer.shtml">Marquette
University's</a>
<a href="http://www.marquette.edu/conference-services/straz.php">Straz Tower</a>,
three blocks from the special bus that takes summer visitors to the
lakefront Henry Maier Festival Park and right on the Wisconsin Avenue
route that takes baseball fans to Miller Park on game days.</p>
<p>You also can stay a mile farther along Wisconsin Avenue at the
seven-story <a href="http://www.marquette.edu/conference-services/mashuda.php">Mashuda
Hall</a>, a
former hotel where the Beatles stayed after their Milwaukee gig in 1964.
It's next to the Pabst Mansion.</p>
<p>The air-conditioned rooms, all with WiFi, are available from late May to
mid-August, but only if a conference also has booked rooms in one of the
dorms. That's most days but usually doesn't include holiday weekends.
Call 414-288-7208 to reserve.</p>
<p>Many other colleges have dorms that are open to the public in summer.
For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/dorms-hostels/dorm-lodgings-midwest/">On budget in a
dorm</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/green_bay_amusement_park.jpg" alt="Rides at Bay Beach Amusement Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Green Bay's Bay Beach Amusement Park, most rides cost 50 cents.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h2>A day at an amusement park</h2>
<p>On the shores of Lake Michigan, Bay Beach Amusement Park is one of the
region's best deals for families.</p>
<h3>Fun in Green Bay</h3>
<p>Want to take the kids to an amusement park, but don't want to pay $78
for a pass to Six Flags?</p>
<p>Spend a day at the wonderfully old-fashioned <a href="https://greenbaywi.gov/445/Bay-Beach">Bay Beach Amusement
Park</a> in Green Bay, where $78 will buy you 312 rides down the giant slide,
156 rides on a Tilt-A-Whirl or Ferris wheel or 78 rides on the Zippin
Pippin roller coaster, a replica of Elvis' favorite ride in Memphis.
And parking is free.</p>
<p>Green Bay still has inexpensive mom-and-pop motels, such as the <a href="http://baymotelgreenbay.com/">Bay
Motel</a>. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/green-bay-kids/">Packer
country</a>.</p>
<h2>Volunteering</h2>
<h3>Life in a lighthouse</h3>
<p>Many lighthouses on the Great Lakes give free housing to volunteer
keepers in return for help with tours and light maintenance.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/rockisland/lighthouse">Pottawatomie
Light</a> on
Wisconsin's <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/rockisland/">Rock Island State
Park</a>, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2229540025/">Friends of
Rock Island State Park</a> recruit volunteer docents to
spend a week at this 1858 lighthouse at the farthest tip of Door County.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/apis/index.htm">Apostle Islands National
Lakeshore</a>, the park needs volunteer
keepers at the
<a href="http://www.nps.gov/apis/historyculture/sand-light.htm">Sand</a>,
<a href="http://www.nps.gov/apis/historyculture/devils-light.htm">Devils</a> and
Michigan lights.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/volunteer-lighthouse-keepers/">Living in a
lighthouse</a>.</p>
<h3>Building a national trail</h3>
<p>Spend a few days helping to build the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/iatr/index.htm">Ice Age National Scenic
Trail</a>, and the food and camping
— not to mention the camaraderie — are free.</p>
<p>From May through October, <a href="https://www.iceagetrail.org/mobile-skills-crew-program/">work
crews</a> spend
five or six days apiece on six stretches of the trail, from Polk County
in western Wisconsin to Storrs Lake in Rock County, near Madison.
