<p>After a long winter, everyone deserves a spring getaway.</p>
<p>On a budget? No problem. Spring is the best time to find deals, and
often the weather is stellar.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin's Blue Hills, help out at a nature preserve and stay free.
In central Iowa, learn orienteering and archery at a women's skills
retreat. In Chicago, have a sleepover in a museum or stay at one of
three hostels during Craft Beer Week.</p>
<p>Think a little bit outside the box, and you'll save a ton of money.</p>
<p>Here's our <strong>2022</strong> list of great spring trips , most costing $100 or
less per person.</p>

Wilds Environmental Learning Center</a>,

center's lodges, $40 for a room that sleeps four adults or a family of

<h3>Riding high in Green Bay</h3>
<p>In Green Bay, <a href="https://greenbaywi.gov/445/Bay-Beach">Bay Beach Amusement
Park</a> is a perennial best bet,
with its 50 cent tickets - except for the Zippin Pippin roller
coaster, which is a whole $1, and the Sea Dragon swinging Viking-ship
ride, which is 75 cents.</p>

<h3>Watching prairie chickens court</h3>
<p>On the sand plains between Wisconsin Rapids and Stevens Point, prairie
chickens conduct a goofy courtship, complete with booming and stomping,
that draws bird watchers from around the region.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.uwsp.edu/wildlife/pchicken/Pages/viewing.aspx">Reserve a space in a
blind</a> in
<em>April</em> and you'll get to see the whole thing. Cost is $15 per person,

original &quot;working-man&quot; rooms, $46-$60. They don't have private
baths, but most have river views.</p>

<h2>IOWA</h2>
<h3>Women in the woods</h3>
<p>Iowa's <a href="https://www.iowadnr.gov/Things-to-Do/Camps-Workshops/Becoming-an-Outdoors-Woman">Becoming an Outdoors
Woman</a>
program offers a skills workshop <em>May 20-22</em> at Wesley Woods Camp &amp;
Retreat Center near Indianola.</p>
<p>Women choose from more than 20 skills, including horseback-riding
kayaking, fly fishing, bird-watching, archery, nature photography and
orienteering. Cost is $280 for lodgings, meals, gear and instruction.</p>
<h3>Maifest in Amana</h3>
<p>There's always something going on in the <a href="http://www.amanacolonies.org/">Amana
Colonies</a>, a group of once-communal
villages southwest of Cedar Rapids, Iowa.
<a href="https://amanacolonies.com/things-to-do/festivals/maifest/">Maifest</a>
festivities include the Taste of the Amanas food fair, Maypole dancing,
German music and a parade <em>April 30-</em> <em>May 1</em> .</p>
<p>Stay in one of four family cabins, $50, at beautiful <a href="http://www.iowadnr.gov/Destinations/StateParksRecAreas/IowasStateParks/ParkDetails.aspx?ParkID=610113&amp;idAdminBoundary=202">Palisades-Kepler

<h3>Cabins and wildflowers</h3>
<p>Iowa state parks have a wonderful variety of cabins, and they're a
bargain, but they rent by the week in summer.</p>
<p>In spring, there's only a two-night minimum. One year, on Mother's Day
weekend, we rented a $50 cabin with bath and kitchen in <a href="http://www.iowadnr.gov/Destinations/StateParksRecAreas/IowasStateParks/ParkDetails.aspx?ParkID=610105&amp;idAdminBoundary=170">Backbone State
Park</a>, near Strawberry Point.</p>
<p>We hit the peak of wildflower season, hiking the trails around Backbone
Lake; the park was named for knobs of rock that erupt from the middle of
the trail.</p>
<p>It doesn't look like most people's idea of Iowa; twisted cedars grew
out of fissures, and we passed huge white pines and squeezed between
house-sized piles of limestone.</p>
<p>Cabin guests can bring pets, and entrance to Iowa state parks is free.
For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/iowa-state-park-cabins/">A cabin in
Iowa</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/backbone_cabin_lake.jpg" alt="Cabin in Backbone State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Iowa's Backbone State Park, family cabins overlook the lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Cabins and bicycle trails</h3>
<p>Iowa has dozens of <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-iowa-trails/">bike
trails</a>
and hundreds of cabins in county and state parks. Put them together, and
you've got a cheap weekend.</p>
<p>The Raccoon River Valley Trail west of Des Moines is 89 miles, with a
dog leg between Clive and Jefferson and a new loop that crosses the
North Raccoon River in Dawson.</p>
<p>That's where <a href="http://www.mycountyparks.com/County/Dallas/Park/Sportsman-Park.aspx">Sportsman
Park</a>
rents two cabins that sleep five and have a bathroom and kitchenette.
They rent for $55 on weekdays and $65 weekends.</p>
<p>Near Adel, the three-bedroom, two-bath <a href="http://www.mycountyparks.com/county/Dallas/Park/Glissman-Conservation-Area/Facility/Glissman-Lodge.aspx">Glissman
Lodge</a>
in Glissman Conservation Area sleeps eight and rents for $85 weeknights
and $240 total for Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
<p>Check

dozens of other cabins around the state.</p>

<h3>A night in the museum</h3>
<p>With so many world-class museums, Chicago makes a great spring-break
destination. Families can even sleep at the museums. At <a href="https://www.sheddaquarium.org/">Shedd
Aquarium</a>, children 5 and older can be
<a href="https://www.sheddaquarium.org/Learning-Experiences/Youth-Programs/Overnights/">Asleep With the
Fishes</a>. Cost is $85, including dinner and breakfast.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/">Field Museum</a> offers <a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org/at-the-field/programs/dozin-dinos">Dozin' With
the
Dinos</a>.
Cost is $68, including a snack and breakfast.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.msichicago.org/">Museum of Science and Industry</a>, 
there are <a href="http://www.msichicago.org/explore/whats-here/events/science-snoozeum/">Science Snoozeum
overnights</a>
for children ages 6-12. Cost of $65 includes an Omnimax film, scavenger
hunt, science toy-making, breakfast and parking.</p>

<h3>Festivals and hostels</h3>
<p>Summer is very popular in Chicago, and it's hard to save money then.</p>
<p>But in spring, you can find a cheap flight and stay in a hostel for as
little as $32, including breakfast.</p>
<p>Try the Hostelling International  <a href="http://www.hichicago.org/">family
hostel</a> in the South Loop; the <a href="https://freehandhotels.com/chicago/">Freehand
Hotel</a>, in a former 1927 hotel in
River North; or the <a href="http://www.getawayhostel.com/">Chicago Getaway
Hostel</a> near Lincoln Park.</p>
<p>Use the <a href="https://www.divvybikes.com/">Divvy bike-sharing program</a> to
ride the Lakeshore Trail.</p>
