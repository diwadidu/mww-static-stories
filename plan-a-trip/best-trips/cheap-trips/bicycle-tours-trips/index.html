<h2>Join a rolling tour, and you'll see the best of the Upper Midwest.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/o/iowa_ragbrai.jpg" alt="RAGBRAI riders in Iowa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Iowa, RAGBRAI draws so many riders that its route is closed to cars.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's nothing like traveling the countryside on a bicycle.</p>
<p>From a bike seat, you hear the murmur of wind through field and forest,
and you actually notice the sky and its clouds, as mesmerizing as a lava
lamp.</p>
<p>You can ride on your own, but it's more fun to join one of the many
cross-state rides organized by bicycle clubs and charities.</p>
<p>For six years, I rode on the MS Society's Ride Across Minnesota, a
rolling oasis of harmony and good will.</p>
<p>On the same week in July, the Des Moines Register holds its Annual Great
Bike Ride Across Iowa. Started by two columnists in 1973, it's now the
granddaddy of cross-state rides and attracts up to 20,000 people from
every state and many countries.</p>
<p>I grew up bicycling in Iowa and rode my first century when I was 16, so
people always were amazed I'd never ridden Iowa's big tour. I wasn't
wild about the idea — I suspected tranquil TRAM had spoiled me for
rowdy RAGBRAI — but finally I did it.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Both rides give city dwellers a rare window into rural and small-town
life. But they're different, all right.</p>
<p>RAGBRAI is so big — 8,500 weeklong riders and 1,500 daily riders, plus
unknown numbers of unofficial hangers-on — that it's bigger than most
of the towns it goes through. People spill out of the motels and
campgrounds and into private homes and front lawns.</p>
<p>Highways are closed to cars, but they're still so clogged that riders
have to carefully watch the wheels around them. The year I rode, an Iowa
man was killed when he clipped the tire of a bicycle ahead of him and
was thrown off his bike.</p>
<p>There's transport for gear, and the last town usually offers a shuttle
back to the starting point.</p>
<p>But there's such a crush of people that most people form teams and
organize their own gear transport and shuttle. Converted school buses
follow the riders, many emblazoned with rude names: Team Angry Bitch,
Boozehounds, Baboon Butts.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/a/sault_mup_bike_tour.jpg" alt="Bike campground at the Soo Locks." /><p class="copyright">&copy; League Michigan Cyclists</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Marie, near the International Bridge.

<p>Yes, drinking is a big part of RAGBRAI. My friends and I stayed one
night at a relative's house, one night on the lawn of a nursing home
and one night next to a church, so we were insulated from late-night
parties.</p>
<p>But one morning at a pop-up espresso shop along the route, I ran into
Twin Cities friend Fran Howley, who had camped at a private home and was
beyond grumpy.</p>
<p>&quot;I went to bed at 9, but I didn't get to sleep until 2:30, when all the
drunk and profane people stopped drifting by,&quot; she said. &quot;This will
be a one-time experience for me.&quot;</p>
<p>But at the same coffee stop, I met Rob Svendsen, a triathlon coach from
Chicago. Like so many people, he was enchanted by the hugely
enthusiastic welcome riders get from small towns along the route.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Iowa is just special,&quot; he said. &quot;It's kind of like the movie
'Waiting for Guffman,' where all these people are planning months in
advance for just one half day.&quot;</p>
<p>These Iowa cornfields pull in people from all over the world. One small
town asked riders to mark their hometowns on a map of the world, and by
9:30 a.m. it showed riders from Ireland, France, Finland, Thailand,
Germany, Italy, Australia and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>For me, three nights on RAGBRAI was enough. But of my group of eight
from the Twin Cities, I was the only drop-out.</p>
<p>My friend John Lauber of Minneapolis, who also grew up in Iowa, likes to
ride a partial RAGBRAI.</p>
<p>&quot;I do think seven days of RAGBRAI is too much; it's a horde, and you
feel like you've joined the Crusades,&quot; he said. &quot;But I just love the
small towns, because they rise to the occasion. And I like the
countryside.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/a/ragbrai_map.jpg" alt="A map of riders on RAGBRAI." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>All the rides have one thing in common: For a week or so, people get to
occupy a parallel universe.</p>
<p>Its couture is smart-alecky T-shirts and helmets topped by traffic
cones, loons, Viking horns and raccoon tails. Its cuisine is barbecued
pork, sweet corn and root-beer floats.</p>
<p>Its citizens are unfailingly friendly and their language a cheerful
Bizarro dialect in which &quot;headwinds&quot; become &quot;air-conditioning.&quot;
Its terrain is storybook farmsteads and peaceful hamlets.</p>
<p>For many folks, that's a real vacation.</p>
<h3>Choosing a ride</h3>
<p>For anyone who's reasonably fit, bike tours are the best possible way
to see the countryside, and they're also of the great deals of vacation
travel.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/i/gitap_family.jpg" alt="A dad and his daughters on an Illinois bike tour." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Larry Varney</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On GITAP, the Grand Illinois Trail and Parks ride, this family wore
T-shirts that read, "1 Dad, 2 Daughters, 3 Bikes, 7 Days . . .
Priceless."
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On rides that benefit good causes, you're almost guaranteed that fellow
riders will be people worth knowing.</p>
<p>At most, the sponsors do everything for participants except pedal and
set up tents.</p>
<p>To <em>get the lowest rates, sign up early</em> ; most tours increase fees as
the tour approaches. <em>Some tours limit riders and sell out</em> .</p>
<p>Fees include a camping space, hot showers, snacks, gear shuttle and
on-road support. Some rides offer a meal plan. Usually, children's fees
are discounted.</p>
<p>Registration fees increase as the ride gets closer; sign up early to
save.</p>
