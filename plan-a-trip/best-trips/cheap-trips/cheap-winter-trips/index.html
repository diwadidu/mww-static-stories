</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the Upper Midwest, finding a good deal is a sport second only to
football.</p>
<p>Some of us need a bargain. Some of us just like them. But we all need to
get away occasionally, especially when cabin fever strikes in winter.</p>
<p>The easiest way to save is to round up a group of friends and rent a
guesthouse in a state park. After that, most of the fun — skiing,
snowshoeing, bird-watching, festival-attending — is free.</p>
<p>You also can snowshoe from a yurt or lodge in the Upper Peninsula, have
a museum sleepover in Chicago, track wolves in Wisconsin and go on a
snowshoe-archery biathlon in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Here are 20 inexpensive weekend trips in <em>2022</em> , most for $100 or less
per person.</p>
<p>For outdoor weekends that cost a bit more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/budget-winter-adventures/">Winter adventure on a
budget</a>.</p>

<h3>A cabin and gliding by candlelight</h3>
<p>If you love to ski or snowshoe by candlelight in state parks but you
have a hard time leaving the house in the dark, just make your home in
the park for the night.</p>
<p>Minnesota has heated <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/camper_cabins.html">camper
cabins</a> in
many of the parks that host <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/candlelight_events.html">candlelight
events</a>. They're a little expensive at $80-$90 plus the $7 on-line
reservation fee, but they sleep six, so you can split the cost.</p>
<p>Or not — the cabins are rustic, but a couple can make them romantic
with a crackling fire under the stars.</p>
<p>The candlelight ski at Mille Lacs-Kathio is one of the region's best,
and that state park has five camper cabins.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/shedd_aquarium.jpg" alt="Shedd Aquarium in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Chicago, Shedd Aquarium offers Asleep With the Fishes family
sleepovers.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Other best bets: ski and snowshoe events at Lake Bemidji State Park
(four cabins); at Lake Carlos near Alexandria, (four cabins); and at
Itasca State Park (12 modern, two-room suites).</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/candlelight-ski-snowshoe-events/">Ski or snowshoe by
candlelight</a>.</p>

<h3>Winter skills for women</h3>
<p>Minnesota's BOW, or <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/education/bow/index.html">Becoming an Outdoors
Woman,</a> program
usually offers a Winter Workshop.</p>
<p>Participants get to choose among a variety of activities, including
trapping, dark-house fishing, animal tracking, wild-game cooking and the
popular snowshoe archery biathlon.</p>
<p>Cost of $195 includes dorm lodgings and all meals. Reserve as early as
possible. See below for Michigan's and Wisconsin's BOW workshops.</p>

<h3>Playing in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/itasca-skiing/">Itasca State Park</a></h3>
<p>The headwaters of the Mississippi River in Minnesota's <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/index.html">Itasca State
Park</a> are a
must-see destination in summer.</p>
<p>In winter, the park grooms 13 miles of cross-country ski trails, many of
which wind through old-growth pine forest. There's also ice-fishing and
snowshoeing.</p>
<p>Stay in the park's
<a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/lodging/units_rooms.html#itasca_suites">Four-Season Suites</a>
near Douglas Lodge, which have kitchenettes and satellite TV. They're
$105 in winter.</p>
<p>There's also a guesthouse and cabin, both with full kitchens, at <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/la_salle_lake/index.html">La
Salle Lake State Recreation
Area</a>,
eight miles north of Itasca.</p>

<h3>Get away to bluff country</h3>
<p>The
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Lanesboro</a>
area, so popular with bicyclists in summer and fall, is very quiet in
winter.</p>
<p>In many years, however, it gets dumped with snow, allowing skiing on the
groomed Harmony-Preston Valley and Root River state trails.</p>
<p>Skiing is best on the quiet and scenic stretch of the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/blufflands/harmony_preston.html">Harmony-Preston
Valley State
Trail</a>
between Isinours Junction, five miles west of Lanesboro, and Preston.
(To get to Isinours, turn south onto County Road 17 from County Road 8,
halfway between Fountain and Lanesboro.)</p>
<p>In January, there's a candlelight ski on the trail from
<a href="http://www.prestonmnchamber.com/">Preston</a>, with chili around a
bonfire. On the Root River State Trail, there's a candlelight ski from
Whalan , with a soup supper in the village hall.</p>
<p>In Lanesboro, stay at the <a href="http://www.cottagehouseinn.com">Cottage House
Inn</a>, where rooms are $75. There's
shopping and Amish tours, too.</p>

<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-skiing-porcupines-michigan/">Snowshoeing in the Porkies</a></h3>
<p>In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State
Park has everything you need for great snowshoeing — 100 miles of
trails, guaranteed snow and a cheap place to stay. Even the snowshoes
are free to use, though supplies are limited.</p>
<p>The park naturalist usually offers guided snowshoe treks on Saturdays in
January and February and lantern-lit skiing and snowshoeing on a
one-mile loop on Saturday nights from late December through February.</p>
<p>The park gets piles of lake-effect snow from November through April. In
winter, you'll need snowshoes or skis to get to its four year-round
yurts, which have wood stoves but no running water.</p>
<p>The
<a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=506&amp;type=SPCG">yurts</a>

six and $100 for up to 10. A sauna and shower costs extra.</p>
<h3>Cabins and guesthouses in state parks</h3>
<p>In the only state that borders three Great Lakes, the best places to
stay are in state parks. Michigan has a huge array of lodges, cottages,
cabins and yurts.</p>
<p>Try <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/tahquamenon-falls-michigan/">Tahquamenon Falls State
Park</a>, which
has its own brewpub restaurant and naturalist programs in winter. Stay
in a three-bedroom, two-bath
<a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=519&amp;type=SPCG">lodge</a>
that sleeps eight, $126 with a four-night minimum, or a <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=528&amp;type=SPCG">camper
cabin</a>
that sleeps seven, $65-$70.</p>
<p>On <em><strong>Saturdays in February</strong></em> , there are guided snowshoe adventures
and lantern-lit skiing and showshoeing.</p>

cabins</a>.</p>
<h2>Illinois</h2>
<h3>Family sleepovers in Chicago</h3>
<p>January and February are the slowest months of the year in this
always-fun town, and also the cheapest time.</p>
<p>It's easiest to catch a <a href="https://www.choosechicago.com/articles/museums-art/free-museum-days-in-chicago/">free
day</a>
at one of the museums (especially if you're an Illinois resident).</p>
<p>And if you have children, you can stay overnight in some of the world's
most famous museums - Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, Field Museum,
Museum of Science &amp; Industry — for $65-$75, including food and
programs.</p>
<p>Reserve several months in advance, because they book up quickly.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/museum-family-overnights/">Nights at the
museum</a>.</p>
<h3>Hostels in Chicago</h3>
<p>Hotels aren't cheap in Chicago, but luckily, it also has hostels. In
the South Loop, the <a href="http://www.hichicago.org/">Hostelling International
hostel</a> is so popular that it screens guests
by zip code (too many people from the suburbs want to stay there). Bunks
in dorm rooms on weekends start at $25, including breakfast; private
rooms start at $60.</p>
<p>There are three other hostels, River North, Lincoln Park and Wicker
Park, and usually you can get a good deal at hotels in winter.</p>
<p>With the money you save, you can afford a nice meal, and <a href="http://www.choosechicago.com/things-to-do/dining/chicago-restaurant-week/">Restaurant
Week</a>
is actually two weeks at the end of January and first part of February.</p>

Chicago</a>.</p>
<h2>Outdoors Clubs</h2>
<p>In every state, outdoors clubs offer the cheapest trips with the most
camaraderie. And if you're a beginner, you'll get free instruction
from new friends.</p>

club</a>.</p>
