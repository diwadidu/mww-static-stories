<p>In summer, it's not as hard as you'd think to take a fun trip that
doesn't cost much.</p>
<p>Many of the great travel experiences in Minnesota can't be bought,
anyway — hiking amid old-growth white pines, paddling through bluff
country, listening to loons in the Boundary Waters.</p>
<p>Hikers can find a bunk just off the Superior Hiking Trail near Grand
Marais for $29, and a family of six can learn to camp and play in a
state park for $60 total. For $85-$90 a person, meals included, they
can canoe and walk a ropes course at a lodge outside Lanesboro.</p>
<p>Here's our list of best cheap trips , most costing $100 or less per
person.</p>
<p>Many give you a roof over your head; the trips that require tent camping
also include guides, meals and/or fun things to do.</p>

Wisconsin</a>.</p>

<h2>Outdoor skills</h2>
<h3>Women in the outdoors</h3>
<p>Minnesota's <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/education/bow/calendar.html">Becoming an Outdoors Woman
program</a> offers
day clinics in archery, fishing, paddling and other outdoor sports, and
generally one or more overnight programs.</p>
<h3>Becoming an outdoor family</h3>
<p>To combat the rise of nature-deficit disorder, many state DNRs and
nature centers are sponsoring <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/education/bow/index.html">Becoming an Outdoor
Family</a> weekends,
where families can try all kinds of fun things: archery, fishing,
shooting, orienteering, hiking, rock climbing and geocaching.</p>
<p>In the scenic bluffs of southeast Minnesota, <a href="http://www.eagle-bluff.org">Eagle Bluff Environmental
Learning Center</a> near Lanesboro is offering
a <a href="https://eaglebluffmn.org/camps/2020-becoming-an-outdoors-family/">family
weekend</a>. Cost is $90 per person, or $335 for a family of four, and includes
meals and lodgings.</p>
<p>For $15 per person, you also can stay Friday night and have Saturday
breakfast.</p>

The Lake Wobegon Trail passes many small-town churches.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h2>Bike trips</h2>
<p>An organized bicycle tour is a great way to see the countryside and make
a lot of friends, too. Many of the best are fund-raising rides, and if
you raise the minimum, you pay only the registration fee.</p>
<p>For a complete list, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/weekend-bicycle-trips/">Tours on two
wheels</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/bicycle-tours-trips/">Sightseeing by bicycle</a>.</p>
<h3>Cross-state on the Ride Across Minnesota</h3>
<p>The well-organized, family-friendly <a href="https://mssociety.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=cms.page&amp;id=1682&amp;eventID=576">Ride Across
Minnesota</a>, formerly known as TRAM, is in late July and benefits the Minnesota
chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Society.</p>
<p>Registration is $30-$60, and riders must raise at least $300. Riders
are treated to bountiful food at official rest stops, about every 10
miles, and can buy food from various civic groups at the evening stop,
usually a city park or fairground. There's also evening entertainment.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h2>Paddling</h2>
<h3>Learning to canoe camp</h3>
<p>As part of its I Can! series, Minnesota state parks are offering
overnight <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/ican/paddle.html">canoe
camping</a> on
the St. Croix Water Trail from St. Croix State Park and from Savanna Portage State Park.</p>
<p>Cost is $85 per canoe (two people per canoe) and includes the canoe,
camping gear and meals.</p>
<h3>Relaxing on the Root River</h3>
<p>In Minnesota's bluff country, Lanesboro is known for paddling as well
as bicycling.</p>
<p>Rent a tube or boat from Root River Outfitters, which provides shuttles.
For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/bluff-land/lanesboro-summer-outdoors/">By river and trail in
Lanesboro</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone can
<a href="http://www.lanesboro.com/list/member/sylvan-park-riverview-campgrounds-lanesboro-229">camp</a>
in Sylvan Park, right in the middle of everything, or in the Riverview
campground, above the dam.</p>
<p>There are showers in the Community Center, and on Saturday mornings,
there's a farmers market where you can buy Amish pastries for
breakfast. Camping is first-come, first-served, $20 for tent sites, and
$30 for RVs.</p>
<h2>Fun in town</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/u/munger_trail_bikers_skater.jpg" alt="Skaters and bicyclists use the Munger State Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Willard Munger State Trail starts in West Duluth.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Hike and bike from West Duluth</h3>
<p>In Duluth, Canal Park gets all the tourist love, but there's actually
more to do in West Duluth — paddling the St. Louis River, bicycling the
Willard Munger State Trail, walking and birding on the
Waabizheshikana/Western Waterfront Trail and hiking the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/superior-hiking-trail-duluth/">Duluth sections
of the Superior Hiking
Trail</a>.</p>
<p>You can avoid the high rates of Canal Park hotels by staying at the
<a href="http://www.mungerinn.com/">Willard Munger Inn</a>, where guests get
shuttles to trailheads in Duluth, free use of canoes and bicycles and a
free pass to the Lake Superior Zoo, across the street.</p>
<p>To save even more, camp at the nearby <a href="http://www.duluthindianpointcampground.com/">Indian Point
Campground</a>.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/water-sports/duluth-st-louis-river/">Duluth's other
waterfront</a>.</p>
<h3>Playing in Winona</h3>
<p>In the southeast Minnesota town of Winona, you can check out kayaks,
canoes and stand-up paddleboards from <a href="https://www.cityofwinona.com/Facilities/Facility/Details/Lake-Lodge-Recreation-Center-3">Lake Lodge Recreation
Center</a> on the east end of
Lake Winona, $12-$14.</p>
<p>Stay at the municipal <a href="https://www.prairieislandcampground.com/">Prairie Island
Campground</a> on the river,
which rents canoes, kayaks, stand-up paddleboards and bikes (camping
gear, too) and has a new Tiny House Cabin. Or camp up in <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/great_river_bluffs/index.html">Great River
Bluffs State
Park</a>, which has breathtaking views of the river valley.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/winona-minnesota-fun/">Afloat in
Winona</a>.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h2>Hostels and bunkhouses</h2>
<h3>A renovated barn near Grand Marais</h3>
<p>In summer and fall, Grand Marais is packed with tourists, and it can be
hard to find a room at any price. One option: the <a href="https://hungryhippiehostel.com/the-hostel/">Hungry Hippie
Farm hostel</a> in a
refurbished barn.</p>
<p>It's 10 miles east of town and up County Road 14, just a mile off the
Superior Hiking Trail. Rates are from $29 for a single bunk and $69 for a
private room, including linens, towels and morning coffee. In one room,
pets are allowed for an extra $20.</p>
<p>It also offers glamping tents from $119.</p>
<p>For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Four seasons of Grand
Marais</a>.</p>
<h3>BWCA from a bunkhouse</h3>
<p>Two resorts on the edge of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area allow guests
to stay for $22-$25 per person in bunkhouses while taking day trips
into the wilderness or just relaxing on a lake.</p>
<p>At the end of the Gunflint Trail, <a href="http://www.tuscaroracanoe.com/">Tuscarora
Lodge</a> on Round Lake rents nine
<a href="http://www.tuscaroracanoe.com/partial-outfitting-2/">bunkhouses</a> in the
woods, each sleeping four to nine people, that share a shower house.
Cost is $22 per person, plus $7 for a shower with towel. Each
bunkhouse is rented to only one party at a time, 800-544-3843.</p>
<p>Twenty-two miles east of Ely, <a href="http://lakeonecanoes.com/bunkhouses.html">Kawishiwi Lodge and
Outfitters</a> is on Lake One, an
entry point into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. The resort
has two bunkhouses, each with full kitchen and bath and one with
screened porch, where beds go for $35 per person, with a $140
minimum.</p>
<p>One bunkhouse sleeps nine and one sleeps eight, and each is rented to
only one party at a time. 218-365-5487.</p>

Waters</a> and

Trail</a>
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/gunflint-trail-general/"></a>.</p>
<h2>Work and stay</h2>
<p>Many north-woods lodges and retreat centers offer a free stay in return
for work, though they're most common in spring and late fall.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_campground.jpg" alt="The municipal campground in Grand Marais." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Pitch in at the North House Folk School in Grand Marais and get a free
campsite on Lake Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Learning in Grand Marais</h3>
<p>On the harbor, <a href="https://northhouse.org/">North House Folk School</a> offers
<a href="https://northhouse.org/get-involved/work-study">course credit and a free
campsite</a> in return for
help with daily chores, such as sweeping, mopping and recycling.</p>
<p>The campground is next-door at the Grand Marais Recreation Area
Campground.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Four seasons of Grand
Marais</a>.</p>
<h3>Trail maintenance</h3>
<p>Also in Grand Marais, the <a href="http://shta.org/">Superior Hiking Trail
Association</a> often offers free camping and meals in
return for <a href="http://shta.org/news-events/volunteer-trail-projects/">trail
work</a>.</p>
<h2>Music festivals</h2>
<p>Camping at a music festival is a time-honored way to have fun on a
budget, although some of the bigger fests can get pretty rowdy. Here are
some lower-key fests that are especially family-friendly.</p>
<p>For more, check our <a href="/events/">Events Calendar</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/i/sibley_boy_fishing.jpg" alt="A boy fishing in Sibley State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Camping on the Crow</h3>
<p>In mid-July, the family-friendly <a href="http://www.riversongfestival.org/">RiverSong Music
Festival</a> on the Crow River features
folk, blues, jazz and other grassroots music on three stages, including
one for children.</p>
<p>It's in Hutchinson, west of the Twin Cities.</p>
<h3>Bluegrass and string-band music</h3>
<p>Twenty miles west of St. Cloud, the family-friendly <a href="https://www.minnesotabluegrass.org/mn-bluegrass-festival">Minnesota Bluegrass
&amp; Old-time Music
Festival</a>
includes music on five stages and workshops at El Rancho Mañana
Campground in the first part of August.</p>
<h2>Going with a group</h2>
<p>Traveling with an outdoors club is one of the best deals you can get.
You need to be a member to go on overnight trips, but you don't need to
live in the town where the club is based; you can meet the group at the
destination.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_lodge_bicyclists.jpg" alt="Bicyclists in Whitewater State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At the group center in Whitewater State Park, the Minnesota Rovers get
ready for bicycling.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Outdoors clubs</h3>
<p>One club known for its penny-pinching ways is the <a href="http://www.mnrovers.org/">Minnesota Rovers
Outdoors Club</a>, based in the Twin Cities. It
offers camping trips to Minnesota's North Shore for as little as $15;
you bring your own food, but you can borrow gear from the club if
you're a member.</p>
<p>Membership is $25, $10 for those who live outside the Twin Cities
metro area.</p>
<p>It also offers beginner's trips to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness for  $85-$100. A few spots on trips often are saved for new
members, but watch the trip list and sign up ASAP.</p>
<p>For more about traveling with outdoors clubs around the region, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/groups/club-travel/">Join the club</a>.</p>
<h3>Lodges in state parks</h3>
<p>Six state parks — Whitewater near Rochester, Sibley near New London,
Lake Carlos near Alexandria, St. Croix near Hinckley, Flandrau near New
Ulm and Lake Shetek near Walnut Grove — rent large group centers where
indoor lodgings can cost as little as $5 per person per night.</p>
<p>They're very popular for summer weekends, so be ready when reservations
open.</p>
<p>Many environmental centers also rent to groups. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/groups/group-lodges/">Cabins
for a crowd</a>.</p>
<p>Many other state parks rent lodgings for smaller groups.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/minnesota-state-park-cabins/">Lodgings in Minnesota state
parks</a>.</p>
