<p>Fall is the busiest travel season of the year — we all know the nice
days are numbered, and we're going to try our darndest to make them
count.</p>
<p>But with pretty much everyone heading out to look for fall color,
especially on weekends, there are few bargains.</p>
<p>That's why those of us on a budget look to our old friends: the state
parks, the mom-and-pop motels, the environmental centers, the outdoors
clubs.</p>
<p>Here's our list of 20 great autumn trips. Most of them cost
$100 or less per person.</p>
<p>Sign up for these deals, and you'll be enjoying fall in all the best
places: along the Mississippi River, in bluff country, in the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan.</p>
<p>If you're really planning ahead, or if you want more ideas, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/cheap-winter-trips/">Cheap
winter getaways</a>, <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/cheap-spring-trips/">Cheap spring

<h3>Wolves and pizza in Ely</h3>
<p>In northern Minnesota, the <a href="http://www.wolf.org">International Wolf
Center</a> offers <a href="https://wolf.org/programs/learning-adventures/">Wolf Family
Rendezvous</a> <em>Oct. 22-23</em> in 2022. It'll be a good chance to get up close with the new pups, Blackstone and Caz.</p>

<h3>Concert and camping</h3>
<p>Just east of St. Paul, set up a campsite at <a href="http://www.lakeelmo.org/parks/lake-elmo-park-reserve">Lake Elmo Park
Reserve</a>, then
lean back and enjoy the <a href="http://www.co.washington.mn.us/index.aspx?nid=1559">Washington County Bluegrass
Festival</a> on <em>Sept.
10</em> in 2022. The music is free, campsites are $15-$25 and a daily permit is

<h3>Outdoor skills in Minnesota bluff country</h3>
<p>Minnesota's <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/education/bow/index.html">Becoming an
Outdoorswoman</a>
program offers fall outdoor skills weekends at Eagle Bluff Environmental
Learning Center near Lanesboro. It includes fly fishing, a tour of
Mystery Cave, orienteering, a ropes course, canoeing and a bird hike.</p>

programs.</p>
<h3>Music on the Mississippi</h3>
<p>In Winona, the <a href="http://www.boatsandbluegrass.com/">Boats and Bluegrass</a>
festival <em>Sept. 22-25</em> is a great deal for families. For $120 to $180,
depending on how early you buy your ticket, you get to hear all the
music, camp in the riverside campground and go canoeing — and kids
under 16 are free with an adult ticket.</p>
<p>Extra activities may include old-time circus games, fire dancers, disc
golf, family pontoon rides, nature walks and airplane rides.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/winona_backwaters_boats.jpg" alt="Boats on Winona's backwaters." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Boats putter through Winona's backwaters.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you can't make it, the municipal <a href="https://www.prairieislandcampground.com/">Prairie Island
Campground</a> is a good place to
camp any time, with a beach, playground, deer park, canoe rental, boat
launch, store and showers.</p>
<p>If you have your own boat, bring it; the Mississippi backwaters are fun
to explore.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/winona-minnesota-fun/">Afloat in
Winona</a>.</p>
<h3>A sampler of outdoors sports</h3>
<p>Every fall, the <a href="http://www.mnrovers.org/">Minnesota Rovers Outdoors
Club</a> puts on an <a href="https://mnrovers.org/trips/save-the-date-fall-extravaganza-baker-park-reserve-maple-plain-mn-mn/">Outdoors
Extravaganza</a>
to introduce prospective members to the club. Members lead paddling,
rock-climbing, bicycling and hiking expeditions.</p>
<p>In 2022, it's <em>Sept. 30-Oct. 2</em> in Baker Park Reserve in the Minneapolis suburb of Maple Plain.</p>
<p>Cost of $25 includes two nights of camping plus Saturday supper and
Sunday breakfast.</p>
<p>For planning travel on a nickel, the Rovers and other outdoors clubs are
unparalleled.</p>

or less, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/groups/club-travel/">Join the

<h3>Camping in the middle of Chicago</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/northerly-island">Northerly Island
Park</a>, on Lake Michigan next to the Museum Campus, the Chicago Park District
often offers a Family Camping weekend.</p>
<p>It's $50 for up to six in a tent, which is provided, and includes
hotdogs, marshmallows, tents and programming, including fishing,
fire-building and guided hikes.</p>
<p>If you'd rather have a roof over your head, Chicago has
newfangled hostel hotels in addition to the longtime favorite Hostelling
International hostel in the South Loop.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/hotels-motels/best-hotels-chicago/">Where to stay in
Chicago</a>.</p>
<h3>Deep woods around Ely</h3>
<p>The boreal woods around the northern Minnesota town of Ely, on the edge
of the Boundary Waters, are beautiful any time of year, but especially
in fall.</p>
<p>Just north of town, off the Echo Trail, <a href="http://www.dunord.org/">YMCA Camp du
Nord</a> offers an <a href="https://www.ymcanorth.org/camps/camp_du_nord/family_camp/fall_winter__spring_family_camps">Autumn Adventures Family
Camp</a>
<em>Oct. 20-23,</em> with guided hikes and paddles, nature programs,
campfires, family saunas and arts and crafts, and a du Thanks Family
Camp <em>Nov. 23-27,</em> with a Thanksgiving dinner, s'mores, crafts and a
turkey trot.</p>
<p>There are 21 heated cabins, some with gas fireplaces, in three villages.
Some are rustic, but most are quite luxurious.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_douglas_lodge.jpg" alt="Douglas Lodge at Itasca State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

apiece, and seven people sharing Jack's Cabin pay $99 apiece. Reserve
early to get your choice of cabins, 612-465-0568.</p>
<h3>A roof in a Minnesota state park</h3>
<p>In fall, many leaf-peepers flock to the state parks, because that's
where the color is.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, that's where the action is, too. Pick out one of the many
<a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/events.html">naturalist
programs</a>, then
stay right in the park for the weekend, in a <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/camper_cabin_locations.html">camper
cabin</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/index.html">Itasca State
Park</a>, the
Autumn Harvest Festival includes guided lantern-lit hikes with legendary
characters, children's activities, campfires and music.</p>
<p>Stay in the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/lodging/units_rooms.html">Douglas
Lodge</a>, where rooms for two with shared baths are $85 and rooms for four are
$145.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/itasca-park-tips/">The people's
park</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/whitewater/index.html">Whitewater State
Park</a> in
bluff country, naturalists offer many fall programs, including
bird-banding, history tours, photography, fly fishing, fossil field
trips and a bluegrass jam. Stay in one of the park's four <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/camper_cabins.html">camper
cabins</a>,
$90, or group-camp cabins.</p>
<p>For more about state-park camper cabins in other states, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/camper-cabins-midwest/">A roof in
the woods</a>.</p>
<h3>Yurts and cabins in the Porkies</h3>
<p>Fall is the best time to visit gorgeous Porcupine Mountains Wilderness
State Park, along Lake Superior in Michigan's Upper Peninsula — it has
100 miles of hiking trails, spectacular fall color in the largest stand
of virgin hardwood forest east of the Mississippi, and no bugs.</p>
<p>Stay in one of the cabins and
yurts, which include <a href="https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ParksandTrails/Details.aspx?id=419&amp;type=SPCG">19 wood-heated rustic
cabins</a>
and <a href="https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=506&amp;type=SPCG">four
yurts</a>, $68.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porcupines_waterfalls_fall.jpg" alt="Waterfall in the Porkies." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Fall is gorgeous in Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the cabins, you'll have plenty of privacy, but they're not for
sissies: Seven are within a mile of a trailhead, and one is
handicapped-accessible, but others require a hike of up to four miles.</p>
<p>Cabins on Mirror Lake, Lily Pond and Lake of the Clouds include boats.</p>
<p>Two of the yurts are right on Lake Superior off the campground, and two
can be reached only by trail. They don't have electricity or running
water.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Afoot in the
Porkies</a>.</p>
<h3>Backpacking in the Porkies</h3>
<p>Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park and the Michigan DNR are offering two three-day intermediate backpacking trips, <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/things-to-do/calendar/2022/09/19/intermediate-backpacking-in-the-porkies">Sept. 19-21</a> and <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/things-to-do/calendar/2022/09/21/intermediate-backpacking-in-the-porkies-sept-21-23">Sept. 21-23</a>.</p>
<p>Participants will hike 20 trail miles, and cost is $105. Register by Aug. 29.</p>
<h3>History along the Minnesota River</h3>
<p>Stay in Fort Ridgely State Park, and you can visit historic sites and
stay in a chalet for much less than $100 per person.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/o/fort_ridgely_chalet.jpg" alt="The golf chalet at Fort Ridgely." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Two practice greens form the front yard of Fort Ridgely's golf chalet
guesthouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The park rents out its former <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/fort_ridgely/chalet.html">golf
chalet</a>
for $85, and it sleeps up to 15, though eight would fit better. It has
a kitchen, but no beds. Fort Ridgely Historic Site, important during the
U.S.-Dakota Conflict of 1862, is within the park.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-ulm-german-heritage/">New Ulm</a> is nearby.

<h3>Fall color in waterfall country</h3>
<p>In northeast Wisconsin, an hour east of Eagle River and 20 minutes west
of Florence, <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/cnnf">Chequamegon-Nicolet National
Forest</a> rents eight <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/cnnf/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=27877&amp;actid=101">Lost Lake

at Lost Lake Campground.</p>
<p>The cabins sleep six in three bunk beds, and bathrooms and showers are
in two central buildings. They rent for $40 weekdays, $45 weekends,
and they're open from mid-May to mid-October. Reserve at
<a href="http://www.recreation.gov/">Recreation.Gov</a>.</p>

cedar forest.

<h3>A cabin in a Lake Michigan park</h3>
<p>In fall, it's not as hard to get one of Michigan's many and varied <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/things-to-do/camping-and-lodging/lodging">cabins in
state
parks</a>, 15 of them on Lake Michigan. Most mini-cabins that sleep four are
$49-$52, most rustic cabins that sleep two to five are $65-$68, and
most camper cabins that sleep six are $86-$90.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/michigan-state-park-cabins/">Michigan's great lake
cabins</a>.</p>
<h3>A deal on an indoor water park</h3>
<p>In late October, rates drop precipitously at indoor water parks and stay
low until the holidays.</p>
<p>In the Wisconsin Dells, check <a href="https://www.wisdells.com/wisconsin-dells-deals.htm">resort hot deals and
specials</a>. The best
are for midweek stays.</p>
<p>Some smaller resorts and motels include passes or discounts with a stay,
such as <a href="http://ambershideaway.com/">Ambers Inn &amp; Suites</a>, the <a href="http://www.dellcreek.com/">Dell
Creek Motel</a> and the wooded <a href="http://www.birchcliff.com/">Birchcliff

<h3>Trail clearing in Minnesota</h3>
<p>Here's a weekend trip that pays <em>you</em>.
The Twin Cities-based <a href="https://north-stars.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=0&amp;club_id=402040">North Star Ski Touring
Club</a>
is the largest cross-country club in North America and helped blaze many
of the state's best ski trails. It holds several trips every fall to
clear them for winter, and it reimburses participants for gas money.</p>
<p>Typically, workers put in six to eight hours on Saturdays and four hours
on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lodging and meals are provided by the host resorts or organizations,
typically Camp du Nord near Ely, the Gunflint Lodge, Banadad Trail and
resorts on the North Shore.</p>
<p>It's a good way to meet people, too. Sign up early for the best slots.</p>

<h3>Bicycling the Root River State Trail</h3>
<p>In the southeast corner of Minnesota, the Root River State Trail and
town of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Lanesboro</a>
are a favorite fall destination.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanesboro_trail_center.jpg" alt="The Root River trailhead in Lanesboro." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicyclists head west on the Root River State Trail from downtown
Lanesboro.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Pitch a tent for $20 right downtown, in <a href="https://www.lanesboro.com/list/member/city-of-lanesboro-sylvan-park-campground-3647">Sylvan
Park</a>
or in the <a href="http://www.lanesboro.com/list/member/sylvan-park-riverview-campgrounds-lanesboro-229">Riverview
Campground</a>, or park a camper for $30. Hot showers are $1 at the adjoining
Community Center, and you can pick up pastries from local Amish families
at the Saturday farmers market.</p>
<p>On the three Saturdays after Labor Day, attend <a href="http://www.rootrivertrail.org/events/taste-of-the-trail/">Taste of the Trail
festivities</a>
on three sections of the Root River State Trail.</p>
<p>For more about riding the Root River, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-root-river-trail/">Bicycling in bluff

byways</a>.</p>
<h3>Outdoors in Ironwood</h3>
<p>Michigan's Upper Peninsula is mostly national forest, which means it's a
great place to see fall color — perhaps the best in the region.</p>
<p>Use
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/nordic-skiing-ironwood/">Ironwood</a>
as a base. From there, explore the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/black-river-michigan/">waterfalls along the Black
River</a> north of
Bessemer. Nearby, take in the incredible view from the top of <a href="http://www.copperpeak.org">Copper
Peak</a>, the only ski-flying hill in the
Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Ride a chairlift to the crest of the hill, then take an 18-story
elevator to the top of the jump, $25, $10 for children 5 to 14.</p>
<p>To the south, seek out the waterfalls in Wisconsin's Marinette County.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/u/munger_trail_fall.jpg" alt="Fall colors on the Munger Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3>Reliving historic fires on a Minnesota state trail</h3>
<p>In eastern Minnesota, people zooming up Interstate 35 to the North Shore
usually bypass Banning State Park.</p>
<p>But the park, set along the Kettle River near Sandstone, is one of
Minnesota's most beautiful. And the 75-mile <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/willard_munger/index.html">Willard Munger State
Trail</a>, which connects Hinckley and Duluth, is one of the state's best.</p>
<p>The trail, once a train line, figured prominently in two of Minnesota's
worst tragedies, the 1894 Hinckley Fire, which incinerated Hinckley and
Sandstone, and the Fires of 1918, which destroyed Kettle River and Moose
Lake along the trail, as well as Cloquet.</p>
<p>Museums in Hinckley and Moose Lake tell the gripping stories. For more,
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/munger-bicycle-trail-minnesota/">The Fire
Ride</a>.</p>
<p>A good base to explore the trail is the rustic camper cabin at <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/park.html?id=spk00103">Banning
State
Park</a>, which sleeps five, $80.</p>
<h3>Horseback-riding in northwest Illinois</h3>
<p>Five miles west of Oregon on the Rock River, White Pine Ranch offers an
<a href="http://www.whitepinesranch.com/adults-only-weekend">Adults Only
