<h2>In the Minnesota River Valley, a state park makes golfing and horseback riding easy to afford.</h2>

The scenic, heavily wooded golf course is walking-only.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Of all the fun things a person can do, riding a horse is not one of the cheapest. Unless you�re part of the country-club set, it�s an expensive hobby � kind of like golf.</p>
<p>But there�s one place where you can go on a trail ride and golf and stay overnight � for less than $100 per person.</p>
<p>My friend Debra knew about a Minnesota River Valley stables that offers scenic three-hour trail rides for $60. I knew about a guesthouse right on the golf course in Fort Ridgely State Park where five of us could sleep on the floor for $15 apiece.</p>
<p>Live like a king, sleep like a peasant � that�s our motto.</p>
<p>We headed west from the Twin Cities on a Saturday morning and spent our first day being tourists in <a href="/plan%5Fa%5Ftrip/history%5Fheritage/ethnic%5Ftowns/new%5Fulm.html">New Ulm</a>.</p>
<p>We stopped at Domeier�s German store for European candies, had a picnic on the trails in Flandrau State Park, toured Schell Brewery, visited the Hermann monument and ended up downtown just in time for the 5 p.m. performance of the Glockenspiel.</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>Schell�s established a reputation for hospitality early, and when the Dakota burned New Ulm during the U.S.-Dakota Conflict of 1862, the brewery was untouched. This year, the fifth generation is celebrating its 150th anniversary.</p>
<p>The starving Dakota�s decision to plunder New Ulm on the second day of the war probably saved Fort Ridgely, 20 miles upstream.</p>
<p>The fort, which Chief Big Eagle called �the door to the valley as far as St. Paul,'' didn�t have a stockade or even a well, but it held off the Dakota with artillery.</p>
<p>Today, Fort Ridgely is a state park as well as a historical site where children run atop the ruins of the former barracks.</p>
<p>Built on the lush terraces of the Minnesota River Valley, the state park features a par-35 nine-hole golf course built in 1927 and restored in 2007. On the weekends, golfers pay just $18 to play all day, or $13 for nine holes.</p>
<p>Our home for the night, the golf chalet, had a spectacular view of the first hole, along which the forest-lined fairway sinks into a deep bowl before rising to the green.</p>
<p>Our front yard was two practice greens, so Lauren and I borrowed putters and tried to sink a few. John and Georgia set off to hike the first hole.</p>

<p>�I�d come back just to walk this golf course, it was so pretty,�� Georgia said when they got back.</p>
<p>Golfers still use the chalet�s lower-level bathrooms, which include showers. The top level was just for us and had a kitchen, fireplace, tables and enough floor space for 14 people, though we guessed that eight would be more comfortable.</p>
<p>In the morning, we drove five miles up the hill to the Fort Ridgely Equestrian Center, near the town of Fairfax.</p>
<p>Former teacher Sarah Maass runs the stables, and she and her daughter, Denia Gasner, picked out horses for us. Georgia got the half-Belgian Sherman � &quot;he's a tank, an aircraft carrier,'' Denia said � and I got Mickey, who was touching noses with Max until Denia put a stop to it.</p>
<p>'They don't know each other,'' she explained. &quot;They might decide who's boss then then and there.''</p>
<p>For me, seeing the horses' personalities in play is the best part of a trail ride. Sarah brought up the back with Magnolia, a red roan mare who doesn't like anyone to be behind her. She knows and likes Mick, so I rode in front of Sarah.</p>
<p>ADS:16</p>
<p>When Debra rode at the stables earlier in the summer, she had Nautilus, and hoped to ride him again, but he'd been sold to a young woman: &quot;Naughty had ADHD,'' Denia said. &quot;Now he's with a girl who does lots of different things with him to keep him busy.''</p>
<p>Stable owners have to know everything about their horses. My Mick had a touch of ADHD, too, and Sarah instructed me to keep him tightly focused on the trail ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;They're like children,'' she said. &quot;You know, give 'em an inch . . . ''</p>
<p>The stables adjoin the state park, where the Maass family uses 12 miles of wooded horse trails for its rides. But besides the creeks and wildlife that always pose challenges for riders and their horses, there are people and vehicles in state parks.</p>
<p>I was the least experienced rider in our group, so Sarah gave me a running stream of instruction on how to hold the reins and communicate with my horse, often in subtle ways.</p>
<p>&quot;They can feel a fly on 'em,'' she said. &quot;Horses can tell when you're tense. Keep an easy seat; we call it 'Jell-O butt.' ''</p>

<p>Mick had another peccadillo � instead of accelerating from walk to trot, he'd go straight to canter. It was fun but a little scary, and after a while, Denia switched me to Sherman the tank, who had a trot as smooth as molasses.</p>
<p>The three hours flew by as we climbed into and out of ravines, along creeks and through corn fields.</p>
<p>Along the way, we learned more about the horse business and endurance riding; Sarah and her husband, John, sponsor Fort Ridgely's autumn Ride for the Ridge long-distance endurance ride through the Minnesota River Valley.</p>
<p>It's cheap to buy a horse now, Sarah said, because financially pressed people no longer can care for them. Horses are great, and when we got back, we were so reluctant to leave we helped brush ours down.</p>
<p>But for city folks like me, it's a big treat to let someone else handle the details, so we can enjoy the ride.</p>
