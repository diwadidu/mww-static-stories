<h2>Take a break to lounge on beaches, gawk at river canyons and go on brewery tours.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/e/kenosha_lighthouses.jpg" alt="Lighthouse in Kenosha." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Two pierhead lights mark Kenosha's harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's an endless number of fun things to do in Chicago, which is why
tourists flock to it from around the world. To paraphrase the English
wit Samuel Johnson, &quot;When a man is tired of Chicago, he is tired of
life.&quot;</p>
<p>And yet, everyone needs to get out of town once in a while.</p>
<p>The traditional playground of Wisconsin lies to the north, and the
beaches of  Michigan to the east. To the west, aim for destinations on
rivers: the Fox, the Illinois, the Rock.</p>
<p>It's not easy to get out of Chicagoland, because it sprawls almost
endlessly. Luckily, you can get to some of the destinations below by
train.</p>
<p>Here are 10 great day trips from Chicago, all within an hour and a half
(assuming traffic isn't impossible).</p>
<p><a href="https://metrarail.com/tickets">Metra trains</a> go to many destinations,
and they're a good deal on weekends. Unlimited rides are $10 on a
weekend pass, and up to three kids under 12 ride free.</p>
<p>Metra allows <a href="https://metrarail.com/riding-metra/bikes-trains">bikes on
trains</a> arriving in
Chicago after 9:30 a.m. and leaving before 3 p.m. or after 7:30 p.m.
weekdays, and all day on weekends; bring a bungee cord to secure them.</p>
<h3>Kenosha/More than cheese</h3>
<p>For many Chicagoans, the sight of a turreted castle just off I-94 is a
cheesy but welcome sign they're in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>It's the Mars' Cheese Castle, a mostly beloved tourist trap where
out-of-staters can buy New Glarus beer, Nueske's bacon and Green County
cheese (bring a cooler).</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then, get off that interstate and turn toward downtown Kenosha and its
beaches on Lake Michigan, which are expansive and tranquil.</p>
<p>Downtown Kenosha has a beautiful beach. It's bordered by a long concrete
pier capped by the 1901 Pierhead Light.</p>
<p>Up on the hill is the 1866 Southport Lighthouse, built of Cream City
brick. It's open for tours on weekends from May through October.</p>
<p>If  the day isn't beach-worthy, visit the <a href="http://www.kenosha.org/wp-civilwar/">Civil War
Museum</a>, the <a href="http://www.kenosha.org/wp-museum/">Public
Museum</a> and the free <a href="http://kenoshahistorycenter.org/">Kenosha History
Center</a> and <a href="http://www.kenosha.org/wp-dinosaur/">Dinosaur Discovery
Museum</a>.</p>
<p>You can see all the sights on the <a href="https://www.visitkenosha.com/listing/electric-streetcar/268/">Electric Streetcar
Circulator</a>, which makes a two-mile loop along the shoreline and through downtown
and historic districts.</p>
<p>Or ride on the 10-mile <a href="http://www.kenosha.org/departments/parks/PikeBikeBrochure.pdf">Pike Bike
Trail</a>,
mostly along Lake Michigan, which connects to 10 miles of lakefront
trail in Racine.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="http://www.visitkenosha.com">Visit Kenosha</a>.</p>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> Metra's <a href="https://metrarail.com/maps-schedules/train-lines/UP-N">Union Pacific/North
Line</a> follows
Lake Michigan from downtown Chicago to downtown Kenosha via Evanston.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/a/racine_bicycling.jpg" alt="Bicycling along Racine's lakefront." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Real Racine/Brad Jaeck</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicyclists pass the Main Street drawbridge on Racine's Root River
Pathway.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Racine/Lighthouses and a grand beach</h3>
<p>In Racine, add kringle to your stash of Sconnie goodies. The flaky, iced
O-shaped pastry is sold in more than a dozen flavors - almond is most
popular — and is found in waxed-paper sleeves and displayed in
drawers.</p>
<p>Racine also has gorgeous white-sand beaches. At <a href="http://realracine.com/what-to-do/north-beach">North
Beach</a>, there's a wooden
castle playground called Kids Cove.</p>
<p>Bring a kite — or a bike, because the lakefront trail follows the
beach from the <a href="http://www.racinezoo.org/">Racine Zoo</a> to downtown's
Pershing Park, where there's a splash pad with two dozen jets that kids
like to run through on hot days.</p>
<p>At the marina entrance, there's a red 1910 breakwater light. From the
viewing platform across from it, you can see Wind Point on the far end
of the bay.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On the north end of town, the 1880 <a href="http://windpointlighthouse.org/">Wind Point
Lighthouse</a> is a classic Poe tower
that's one of the tallest on the Great Lakes. On the first Sunday of the
month from June through October, you can tour it.</p>
<p>The city also draws architecture fans from around the world to the SC
Johnson company.</p>
<p>The company offers a free, 90-minute
<a href="https://www.scjohnson.com/en/a-family-company/architecture-and-tours/sc-johnsons-frank-lloyd-wright-buildings-youre-always-welcome-for-tours">tour</a>
of its 1939 Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Administration Building and
15-story Research Tower, completed in 1950, and a free, hour-long tour
of Wingspread, the 1939 home Wright designed for H.F. Johnson Jr.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/wright-buildings-racine-wisconsin/">Wright in
Racine</a>.</p>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  Amtrak's Hiawatha Line goes only to Sturtevant, just
west of downtown. It's not hard to park for free in Racine.</p>
<h3>Milwaukee/A cheaper, mellower big city</h3>
<p>Only 90 miles up Lake Michigan Chicago, Milwaukee has an inferiority
complex — or so it's been said.</p>
<p>But like Chicago, it has beautiful lakefront festival grounds, with big
parties that celebrate heritage: Polish, Italian, German, Irish,
Mexican, American Indian.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_museum_biking.jpg" alt="Biking on the Milwaukee lakefront." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicyclists ride past the Milwaukee Art Museum on the lakefront.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It also has beautiful and beaches, and a lakefront bicycle trail, and
world-class museums — one of which has &quot;wings&quot; that open and close
daily.</p>
<p>What else does it have? Oh yes, beer. Find out all about that on brewery
tours by foot or river boat. And you can drink the city's excellent
craft beer everywhere, even in <a href="http://county.milwaukee.gov/Parks/BeerGardens">county
parks</a>. Some of them
have summer beer gardens, and some are visited by traveling beer truck.</p>
<p>Milwaukee also is <em>much</em> easier to get around by car and is easily
navigated by bicycle, too.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/summer-milwaukee/">Party in
Milwaukee</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/milwaukee-brewery-tours/">Mad about
brew</a>. For trips with children, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/milwaukee-kids/">Playtime in
Milwaukee</a>.</p>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  Amtrak's <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/hiawatha-train">Hiawatha
Line</a> offers six daily trips to
Milwaukee from Union Station. They take 90 minutes.</p>
<h3>Geneva and St. Charles/Bicycling along the Fox River</h3>
<p>It's astonishing how many parks, woods and meadows are along the
40-mile Fox River Trail, just 40 miles west of Chicago's Loop.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_charles_park.jpg" alt="Pottawatomie Park in St. Charles." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Fox River Trail passes Pottawatomie Park in St. Charles.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Riding past St. Charles, Geneva and Batavia, you'll see a Dutch
windmill, Japanese gardens and a lighthouse plus many forest preserves
and wildlife sightings, mainly herons and egrets lurking on the shallow
river.</p>
<p>South of Geneva, covered bike bridges are tucked under the decks of rail
and vehicle bridges, impressively functional pieces of art.</p>
<p>Geneva and St. Charles both have a nice selection of interesting shops
and restaurants, and you can cruise the river on <a href="http://stcriverboats.com/">excursion
boats</a> from St. Charles.</p>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  Geneva is a stop on the <a href="https://metrarail.com/maps-schedules/train-lines/UP-W/map">Metra West
Line</a> from
downtown Chicago. Bicycles can be carried onto the train outside rush
hours.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-geneva-st-charles-illinois/">Towns of the Fox
River</a>.</p>
<h3>Lake Geneva/ A hike past historic houses</h3>
<p>For 150 years, this resort area near the Illinois border has been a
favorite retreat of rich Chicagoans, and today it's a favorite of nearly
everyone.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_geneva_carriage.jpg" alt="Lake Geneva in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A horse-drawn carriage takes tourists around Lake Geneva.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The area includes Delavan Lake and Lake Como, but Geneva Lake is the
place to be, especially if you like to walk and gawk at historic
mansions built by the Wrigleys, Rockefellers and Swifts.</p>
<p>You can see them on the 20-mile footpath that circles the lake, right
through the front yards of the wealthy, or on <a href="http://www.cruiselakegeneva.com/">Lake Geneva Cruise
Line</a>, which gives narrated tours
from May from October.</p>
<p>You can also go canoeing, golfing, horseback-riding or zip-lining. But
most people like to mill around, looking at shops and scenery.</p>
<p>May and September are good times to visit if you don't like crowds.</p>
<p>And there are festivals year-round: Winterfest and National Snow
Sculpting Championships in February, Art in the Park and the Venetian
Festival in August, the Lake Geneva Wine Festival in September,
Oktoberfest in October and the Festival of Lights in December.</p>
<p><a href="https://metrarail.com/maps-schedules/train-lines/UP-NW">Metra's Northwest
Line</a> goes as
far as Harvard, Ill., which is only 19 miles from Lake Geneva. Some
resorts will send a shuttle to pick up guests.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/walking-lake-geneva/">Gawking in Lake
Geneva</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/troy_electric_rail.jpg" alt="The Electric railroad in East Troy." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In East Troy, passengers climb aboard an electric trolley.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Mukwonago /A trolley ride to East Troy</h3>
<p>Half an hour west of Racine, an electric trolley operates on Wisconsin's
last Interurban Line, once a 385-mile network but now reduced to the six
miles between Mukwonago and East Troy. From 1907 to 1939, the cars
carried commuters between East Troy and Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Today, the <a href="http://www.easttroyrr.org/">East Troy Electric Railroad</a>
takes day trippers and their children between the Electric Railroad
Museum in East Troy and the Elegant Farmer farm market in Mukwonago,
which is a good place for a layover.</p>
<p>The market, housed in a big yellow barn, is known for its cider-baked
ham, pies baked in paper bags and freshly made caramel corn.</p>
<p>The train runs from early May to late October. It also offers dinner,
burger and pizza trains.</p>
<h3>Union/Calling all train fans</h3>
<p>Rail aficionados will find much larger trains at the <a href="http://www.irm.org/">Illinois Railway
Museum</a> in Union, between Marengo and Woodstock in
McHenry County.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>This large, volunteer-run museum complex is filled with locomotives,
cabooses and freight and passenger cars. Short rides that are included
with admission: daily on electric cars, and steam-train rides alternate
with diesel trains on weekends from Memorial Day through September.</p>
<p>The museum is <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/illinois-railway-museum-union">highly
rated</a> by
parents. Most popular with families are the annual Day Out With Thomas
(the Tank Engine) events.</p>
<h3>Starved Rock State Park/Canyons and wildflowers</h3>
<p>When you really need some breathing room, this is the place to go.</p>
<p>It's a popular park, but you can lose yourself in 18 spectacular
canyons, carved by meltwater at the end of the last Ice Age. Easily
reached by park trails, they're cool refuges with towering walls of
sandstone.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/starved_rock_ottawa_canyon.jpg" alt="Ottawa Canyon in Starved Rock State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Starved Rock State Park, children play in Ottawa Canyon.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The park includes a lodge built during the 1930s by the Civilian
Conservation Corps, including a restaurant and cabins.</p>
<p>Starved Rock is a year-round destination: In spring, wildflowers are
abundant. In winter, bald-eagles congregate on the river and ice freezes
into falls and formations in the canyons.</p>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  The park is across the Illinois River from Utica, just
south of Interstate 80. It's 94 miles from Chicago.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/starved-rock-park-illinois/">Marvels of Starved
Rock</a>.</p>
<h3>Indiana Dunes/A national park and steel plants</h3>
<p>The western edge of <a href="https://www.nps.gov/indu/index.htm">Indiana Dunes National
Park</a> is just a hop and a skip from
Chicago.</p>
<p>The drive isn't particularly fun, but you can take the train. The park
is lovely, with trails through golden dunes and wetland ponds lined with
lily pads.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/n/indiana_dunes_beach.jpg" alt="The beach at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The beach at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore is flanked by steel mills.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The beach is beautiful, too, though flanked by steel mills, and the
skyscrapers of Chicago are visible in the distance.</p>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  The <a href="http://www.mysouthshoreline.com/">South Shore
Line</a> train from Millennium Station
stops at <a href="http://www.nps.gov/indu/planyourvisit/publictransportation.htm">four stations in the
park</a>.</p>
<p>It's a 45-minute ride to the Dune Park station, which is two miles from
the beach at <a href="http://www.in.gov/dnr/parklake/files/dunes_trail.pdf">Indiana Dunes State
Park</a>. It's a
90-minute ride to the Beverly Shores station, which is one mile from
Lake View Beach.</p>
<h3>New Buffalo/Beaches of Lake Michigan</h3>
<p>The beaches of Lake Michigan are very popular, and with good reason.</p>
<p>New Buffalo is the closest town to the Indiana border, and it's a
classic beach town, with a relaxed atmosphere and a main street lined
with shops that sell fudge, ice cream and beach accessories.</p>
<p>The train pulls right up to the Harbor Grand Hotel, from which
passengers can walk to the little downtown and across a causeway to the
beach.</p>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  It's 70 miles by car. Amtrak's <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/michigan-services-train">Wolverine and Blue
Water lines</a>
leave Chicago's Union Station twice a day and arrives in New Buffalo
two and a half hours later.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/white_pines_cabins.jpg" alt="Cabins of White Pines Inn." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Cabins sit along paths in White Pines Forest State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Getaways within two hours</h3>
<p>As much as Chicago has to offer, it doesn't offer any cabins in the
woods. But you can find some adorable ones in <em>White Pines Forest State
Park,</em>  just west of <em>Oregon</em> on the Rock River.</p>
<p>The log cabins and a log lodge were built in the 1930s by the Civilian
Conservation Corps.</p>
<p>The lodge houses an inviting restaurant that's famous for its Paul
Bunyan buffet on Sundays and serves such classics as chicken pot pie,
peach cobbler and apple dumplings. There's a dinner theater, too.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/oregon-illinois-sightseeing/">On the Rock River in
Illinois</a>.</p>
<h3>Getaways within three hours</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most-loved weekend destination for Chicagoans is Galena,
known for its history, architecture, festivals and shopping.</p>
<p>For more,
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/galena-getaway/">Galena getaway</a>.</p>
<p>If you've been to Galena many times and are looking for something new,
just drive across the Mississippi River to Dubuque.</p>

Dubuque</a>.</p>
