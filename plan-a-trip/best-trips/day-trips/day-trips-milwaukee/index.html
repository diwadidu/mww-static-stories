<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a> doesn't toot its own
horn much, so you've got to explore it yourself to see how much fun it
can be.</p>
<p>Right in town, you can spend an entire day <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/milwaukee-brewery-tours/">touring
breweries</a>
or riding on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/Interurban-milwaukee-bike-trails/">Oak Leaf
Trail</a>, a 100-mile chain of paved paths, parkways and connecting streets.</p>
<p>But the city also is surrounded by old Yankee mill towns and German
settlements.</p>
<p>To the west, the last glacier left a trail of kettle lakes that are a
summer playground. Hikers and skiers head for Kettle Moraine State
Forest and the Ice Age National Scenic Trail, which winds through it.</p>
<p>The famous Lake Geneva resort area lies to the south. And then there's
Lake Michigan, which provides miles and miles of gorgeous white-sand
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-lake-michigan/">beaches</a> right up to
the Illinois border.</p>
<p>On balmy days in summer and fall, the lake itself becomes a destination:
Buy a round-trip ticket on the Lake Express and spend a day riding the
waves and exploring the Michigan port town of Muskegon.</p>

<h3>Milwaukee to Kenosha/ Looking for lighthouses</h3>
<p>Start at the newly restored 1887 <a href="http://www.northpointlighthouse.org">North Point
Lighthouse</a>, hidden amid the trees
of blufftop Lake Park. It's open 1-4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays
throughout the year.</p>
<p>Then drive along the lake, past the striking Milwaukee Art Museum, to
Lakeshore State Park on the harbor. The white 1926 Breakwater Light sits
at the harbor entrance, and the 1907 cylindrical red Pierhead Lighthouse
is nearby.</p>
<p>Head south on Wisconsin 32 to the northern edge of Racine. Turn east on
Three Mile Road to see the 1880 <a href="https://windpointlighthouse.org/">Wind Point
Lighthouse</a>, a classic Poe tower
that's one of the tallest on the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>The grounds are open year-round, and the tower is open on the first
Sundays from June through October.
<a href="https://windpointlighthouse.org/visit-us/">Tours</a> are $10; reserve in
advance.</p>
<p>Take Lighthouse Drive to North Main Street and <a href="http://www.racine.org/north_beach.html">North
Beach</a>, a broad expanse of
lovely white sand. There's a wooden castle playground here called Kids
Cove. Bring a kite — or a bike, because a trail follows the beach from
the Racine Zoo to downtown.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/a/racine_wind_point2.jpg" alt="Wind Point Lighthouse in Racine." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Racine, 108-foot Wind Point Lighthouse was designed by Orlando Poe.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At the marina entrance downtown, there's a red 1910 breakwater light.
From the viewing platform across from it, you can see Wind Point on the
far end of the bay.</p>
<p>Just down the shore at Pershing Park, there's a fountain with two dozen
jets that kids like to run through on hot days.</p>
<p>Get back onto Wisconsin 32 — follow the Lake Michigan Circle Tour signs
— to Kenosha.</p>
<p>Kenosha also has a beautiful sand beach. It's bordered by a long
concrete pier, and at the end sits the red 1901 Pierhead Light. A
shorter breakwater Light, white with a green stripe, is on the other end
of the harbor entrance.</p>
<p>Up on the hill is the 1866 <a href="http://www.kenoshahistorycenter.org/lightstation.html">Southport
Lighthouse</a>,
built of Cream City brick. It's open Friday through Sunday from mid-May
through October.</p>
<p>See all the sights on the <a href="http://www.visitkenosha.com/attractions/top-attractions/electric-streetcar-circulator">Electric Streetcar
Circulator</a>, which makes a two-mile loop along the shoreline and through downtown
and historic districts.</p>
<h3>Cedarburg/ Shopping with a dab of history</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/e/cedarburg_mill_pagoda.jpg" alt="A grist mill and teahouse in Cedarburg." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Cedarburg, historic buildings include an 1855 Greek Revival grist
mill and a 1926 filling station built in the style of a Japanese
teahouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If Cedarburg didn't exist, it would have to be created, by popular
demand.</p>
<p>For visitors who enjoy a dip into the past, with occasional breaks for
cappuccino and crepes, this little village, just 20 miles north of
Milwaukee, is practically perfect. There's an 1864 woolen mill at one
end of main street, now housing a winery and two dozen shops.</p>
<p>There are stone, brick and clapboard cottages lining a rushing creek.
There's a five-story 1855 Greek Revival grist mill, now a microbrewery,
and a handsome brick fire tower peeking over the rooftops.</p>
<p>There's even an 1876 covered bridge, made from heavy latticed planks
and wooden pegs. The overall effect evokes a bygone era — not of the
days when 9-year-olds hunched over looms and stagecoaches raised clouds
of dust, but a Rockwellian era of brass bands in gazebos and sleigh
rides down gaslit streets.</p>
<p>The woolen mill now is Cedar Creek Settlement, housing shops, cafes and
Cedar Creek Winery, which offers tours and samples. Its Festive Friday
Eves start the Friday before Thanksgiving and continue until Christmas.</p>
<p>Four big parties bring day trippers and tourists pouring into town:
Winter Festival in February, Strawberry Festival in June, Wine &amp; Harvest
Festival in September and Oktoberfest in October.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/cedarburg-wisconsin/">Jolly
Cedarburg</a>.</p>
<p>For shoppers, the first weekend of December is a real blowout, with
Christmas in the Country arts and crafts show at Cedar Creek Settlement
and the Holiday Art Fair at the Cedarburg Community Center.</p>
<h3>Mukwonago / A trolley ride to East Troy</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/u/mukwonago_train.jpg" alt="The East Troy Railroad in Mukwonago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Electric trolleys to East Troy leave from the Elegant Farmer market in
Mukwonago.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>West of Racine, another electric trolley operates on Wisconsin's last
Interurban Line, once a 385-mile network but now reduced to the six
miles between Mukwonago and East Troy. From 1907 to 1939, the cars
carried commuters between East Troy and Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Now, it takes day trippers and their children between the Electric
Railroad Museum in East Troy and the Elegant Farmer farm market in
Mukwonago, which is a good place for a layover.</p>
<p>Outside the big yellow barn, kids rock furiously on tall wooden hobby
horses. Inside, they snack on freshly made caramel corn, ice cream and
cookies draped in thick icing.</p>
<p>There's a deli; the Elegant Farmer is known for its cider-baked ham,
cheese and pies baked in paper bags.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.easttroyrr.org/">East Troy Electric Railroad</a> runs from
early May to late October. Dinner excursions are held on many Saturdays,
and a Brew Train goes out the first Friday of the month.</p>
<p>Special events include the Halloween Express and the Christmas Express
on the first two weekends of December.</p>
<h3>Port Washington/ To Lake Michigan by bicycle</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/port_washington_fishing.jpg" alt="A captain cleaning fish from Lake Michigan." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A charter-boat captain hoses down freshly caught fish in Port
Washington.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>North of Milwaukee, electric trolleys ran as far north as Sheboygan.
Today, 30 miles of that line is Ozaukee County's paved Interurban Trail.
Start in Brown Deer or Mequon, one of the state's earliest German
settlements.</p>
<p>From there, the trail goes through the mill towns of Thiensville,
Cedarburg and Grafton before entering a stretch of woods. Then it
crosses Interstate 43 and descends into Port Washington, a picturesque
village with a marina full of charter fishing boats and a 1935 art deco
breakwater light.</p>
<p>In the historic downtown, Leland Stanford practiced law before he left
to join the Gold Rush and become governor of California. Stop to see the
quirky Pebble House, built in 1848 of mortar and round stones collected
from the Lake Michigan beach. Now, it's the tourism office.</p>
<p>From the trail just north of downtown, steep wooden steps lead to the
1860 Port Washington Main Lighthouse and the imposing St. Mary's, an
1884 Gothic Revival church.</p>
<p>From Port Washington, the trail continues to Belgium and the county
line. It's not as scenic, but it's flat and perfect for inline skating.</p>

Michigan</a>.</p>

<h3>Horicon Marsh/ Birding by foot, boat or bicycle</h3>
<p>An hour northwest of Milwaukee, you'll find many more birds than
tourists at the Horicon Marsh, the largest freshwater cattail marsh in
the United States and a stopover for migrating ducks, geese and warblers
of many species.</p>
<p>Part of it is a national wildlife refuge and part is a state wildlife
area. The DNR office is on the south edge in the town of Horicon and
offers weekend naturalist programs. The <a href="http://www.fws.gov/midwest/horicon/">national wildlife
refuge</a> has a visitors center is in
Mayville, on the southeast edge.</p>
<p>September and October are the best times to see thousands of ducks and
Canada geese stop in this Wisconsin marsh on their way south, and May is
the best time to watch the northward migration.</p>
<p>Beginning bird-watchers should be sure to go the Horicon Marsh Bird
Festival in May, when they can go on bird hikes and bus tours and see
bird-banding demonstrations.</p>
<p>If you like festivals as well as bird-watching, go the first weekend of
October for Audubon Days in Mayville, which includes a big parade.</p>
<p>But you can see birds any day: by canoe or pontoon boat from Blue Heron
Landing or the two-mile Horicon Habitat Trail, both on the southern tip
of the marsh in Horicon; from bicycle on the Wild Goose State Trail,
along the western edge of the marsh; or from the 50-mile auto route
around it.</p>

Marsh</a>.</p>
<h3>Old World Wisconsin /Transported to the past</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/l/old_world_wisconsin_signpost.jpg" alt="A signpost at Old World Wisconsin." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Each ethnic group has its own frontier homestead at Old World Wisconsin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At <a href="http://oldworldwisconsin.wisconsinhistory.org">Old World Wisconsin</a>, it's always the 19th century.</p>
<p>Costumed interpreters inhabit the buildings of this 576-acre outdoor
museum near Eagle, 40 miles west of Milwaukee. They were brought in from
homesteads all over Wisconsin and reconstructed on site.</p>
<p>In separate settlements, they portray the real people who lived and
worked in them — Danish, Norwegian, German, Finnish, African-American
and Yankee families, trying to get ahead on the American frontier.</p>
<p>There's a Finnish sauna, a stovewood cottage, a one-room schoolhouse and
Milwaukee's first Catholic church. In the regular season, the octagonal
Clausing Barn Restaurant serves cafeteria-style meals.</p>
<p>The newest structure is the Brewhouse, which offers seasonal beer dinners featuring Wisconsin breweries and Historic Brewing 101 immersive programs.</p>
<p>Special events are held year-round, including at Halloween and Christmas. In summer, vintage baseball games are played.</p>
<p>The regular season is May through October. Summer admission is $19.99, $13.99 for
children 5-12; in fall, $15.99 and $9.99.</p>
<p>The nearby glacial landscape provides very scenic hiking. Four miles
west of Old World Wisconsin, a segment of the Ice Age National Scenic
Trail passes the visitors center of the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kms/">Kettle Moraine State
Forest-Southern Unit</a>.</p>
<p>Six miles north, the popular <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kms/trails.html">Scuppernong
Trail</a> has three
loops of various lengths at the intersection of Wisconsin 67 and County
Road ZZ.</p>
<h3>Lake Geneva/ A hike past historic houses</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_geneva_town.jpg" alt="People walking around Geneva Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From the town of Lake Geneva, a path winds around the lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For 150 years, this resort area near the Illinois border has been a
favorite retreat of rich Chicagoans, and today it's a favorite of nearly
everyone.</p>
<p>The area includes Delavan Lake and Lake Como, but Geneva Lake is the
place to be, especially if you like to walk and gawk at historic
mansions built by the Wrigleys, Rockefellers and Swifts.</p>
<p>A 20-mile footpath circles the lake, right through the front yards of
the wealthy.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cruiselakegeneva.com/">Lake Geneva Cruise Line</a> gives
narrated tours from May from October, including the one-hour Geneva Bay
Tour, the two-hour Full Lake Tour, the 2½-hour U.S. Mailboat Tour and
the 3½-hour Black Point Estate Tour. Reserve in advance, especially on
weekends and holidays.</p>
<p>May and September are good times to visit if you don't like crowds, and
there are festivals year-round: Winterfest and National Snow Sculpting
Championships in February, Art in the Park and the Venetian Festival in
August, the Lake Geneva Wine Festival in September, Oktoberfest in
October and the Festival of Lights in December.</p>

Geneva</a>.</p>

<h3>Fort Atkinson/ Entertainment indoors and out</h3>
<p>Since 1963, the professional <a href="http://www.firesidetheatre.com/">Fireside Dinner
Theatre</a> has drawn tourists to this
little town on the Rock River, an hour west of Milwaukee. It has a
surefire formula, offering Broadway musicals and heartwarming Christmas
shows.</p>
<p>During the day, ride the paved 16-mile <a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/road-multi-use-trails/glacial-river-bike-trail-200141">Glacial River
Trail</a> south toward Lake Koshkonong, passing through a wooden covered bridge with a
cupola. On the shore of the lake, visit Indian Mounds &amp; Trail Park,
which protects 11 effigy mounds, some shaped like turtles and birds.</p>
<p>Ancient Indians left many mounds in this area. There are more at
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/aztalan/">Aztalan State Park</a>, 10
miles north of <a href="http://www.fortchamber.com/">Fort Atkinson</a>. Between
1100 and 1300, a cluster of the Mississippian people lived here,
performing ceremonies atop two large, conical temple mounds, one of
which had two platforms reached by stairs and a priest's house on top.</p>
<p>The village has been partially reconstructed, with a 12-foot log
stockade, and visitors can wander the grounds. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-glacial-drumlin-trail/">Riding the
Glacial
Drumlin</a>.</p>
<p>In town, visit the National Dairy Shrine and Hoard Historical Museum,
named for the father of Wisconsin's dairy industry. In the Lincoln
exhibit, hear the story of the local Black Hawk War of 1832, in which
Lincoln served.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.tenchimneys.org/">Ten Chimneys</a> / The beloved retreat of a famous duo</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/e/ten_chimneys_pool.jpg" alt="The pool house at Ten Chimneys." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A striped pool house, topped by a copper mermaid crafted by British
designer Cecil Beaton as a gift, is a favorite spot at Ten Chimneys.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the first half of the 20th century, one couple dominated the Broadway
stage: Milwaukee-born Alfred Lunt and his English wife, Lynn Fontanne.</p>
<p>They were known as &quot;the Fabulous Lunts,&quot; and they had so much star
power they rejected a million-dollar Hollywood film contract, saying
they &quot;could be bought but not bored,&quot; and they took only roles that
would allow them to spend summers at their beloved country house in
Genessee Depot, 25 miles west of Milwaukee.</p>
<p>They called it Ten Chimneys, and frequent visitors included Noel Coward,
Laurence Olivier, Helen Hayes, Katherine Hepburn and Carol Channing, who
said, &quot;What the Vatican is to Catholics, Ten Chimneys is to actors.&quot;</p>
<p>All of the couple's mementos and favorite things are part of the modest
but highly idiosyncratic estate, which includes the Flirtation Room, a
rehearsal space with five entrances, and murals painted by a
set-designer friend.</p>
<p>They don't make 'em like that anymore — neither the house nor the
couple. Today, Ten Chimneys is a National Historic Landmark. Two-hour
estate tours are given from early May to early December, $35. Reserve at
262-968-4110.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/ten-chimneys-wisconsin/">Welcome, darlings, to Ten
Chimneys</a>.</p>
<h3>Muskegon/ To Michigan by ferry</h3>
<p>From May through October, the <a href="http://www.lake-express.com/">Lake
Express</a> high-speed ferry makes the
2½-hour trip from Milwaukee to <a href="http://www.visitmuskegon.org">Muskegon</a>, Mich. Hop aboard at 6 a.m. and you'll have seven hours to play if you
catch the 4:45 p.m. ferry back. Or get on at 12:30 p.m. and catch the 11
p.m. return ferry, which runs in summer.</p>
<p>Bring your bicycle or skates and explore Muskegon on the 12-mile paved
<a href="http://www.muskegon-mi.gov/departments/parks/lakeshore-trail/">Lakeshore
Trail</a>.
From the ferry terminal, ride west to see the South Pier Light Station
and the beach at Pere Marquette Park. Nearby, watch ore boats enter the
Muskegon Lake Channel.</p>
<p>Ride east to downtown or north along Muskegon Lake to Heritage Landing
festival park. For a longer ride, head out on the 26-mile paved
<a href="http://www.musketawatrail.org">Musketawa Trail</a> to Marne, just west of
Grand Rapids.</p>
<p>Round-trips on the ferry are $181 plus $16 for a bicycle.</p>
