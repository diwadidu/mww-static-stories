<p>As wonderful as Minneapolis and St. Paul are, sometimes you just have to
get out of town.</p>
<p>Luckily, you only have to drive an hour or so to find a world of fun.</p>
<p>Minneapolis and St. Paul grew around the confluence of two rivers, and
their favorite day-trip destinations are on rivers, too.</p>
<p>To the southeast, the port of Red Wing is curled into an elbow of the
Mississippi.</p>
<p>To the east, Stillwater and its shops unfurl along the St. Croix, and
there are more shops and restaurants across the river in Hudson.</p>
<p>To the north, Taylors Falls is a hub for hiking and paddling. To the
south, historic Northfield straddles the Cannon River.</p>
<p>You can shop or stroll, cruise or catch a play. Here are 10 lovely
little vacations that will take only a day.</p>

away — check out

<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Red Wing</a> / Boats and a famous view</h3>
<p>Red Wing's picturesque setting on the Mississippi River has been
inspiring comment for centuries; explorer Jonathan Carver called it
&quot;the most beautiful prospect that imagination can form.&quot;</p>
<p>He was standing atop Barn Bluff, a boxy mound that rises between Red
Wing and the river. From its flat top, hikers can watch the traffic —
barges, fishing boats, yachts, paddlewheelers.</p>
<p>That's the balcony of town; Bayfront Park is the front row. That's
another good picnic spot and the center of action during River City Days
the first weekend of August.</p>
<p>Many people know Red Wing for pottery, stoneware and a large stock of
Victorian houses, built when the town was the nation's busiest
grain-shipping center. The beautifully restored Sheldon, opened in 1904,
was the nation's first publicly owned theater.</p>
<p>Get on Amtrak's Empire Builder at 7:50 p.m. in St. Paul and you'll
have an even 12 hours to enjoy Red Wing.</p>
<p>It's <em>45 minutes</em> southeast of St. Paul. And for more fabulous river
views, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mississippi-river-views/">Mississippi
panoramas</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/e/red_wing_from_river2.jpg" alt="Barn Bluff frames Red Wing on the Mississippi." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/excelsior-lake-minnetonka/">Excelsior</a> / Sightsee from a steamboat</h3>
<p>This town on Lake Minnetonka first was frequented by wealthy tourists,
then by the middle class, who arrived on the St. Paul &amp; Minneapolis
Suburban Electric Railway for a day of leisure.</p>
<p>Excelsior still is a small town, with bistros and boutiques occupying
the brick storefronts of Water Street. Its Commons is the best public
space on the lake, with a swimming beach, ball field and bandshell.</p>
<p>Nearby, sample craft beer on the patio of <a href="http://excelsiorbrew.com/">Excelsior
Brewing</a>.</p>
<p>Bicyclists will find it right off the the 15½-mile north corridor of the
crushed-limestone <a href="https://www.threeriversparks.org/location/lake-minnetonka-regional-trail">Lake Minnetonka Regional
Trail</a>, which runs through Excelsior on its way from Hopkins to Victoria and
Carver Park Reserve.</p>
<p>For nightlife, there are plays at the <a href="http://www.oldlog.com/">Old Log
Theater</a>, which specializes in slapstick
comedies.</p>
<p>Watch for the resumption of cruises of the 1906 streetcar boat
<a href="http://www.steamboatminnehaha.org/">Minnehaha</a>, which is looking for a
new dock. Normally, it takes passengers on excursions around the lake,
to free concerts in Wayzata and to see the mansions that line the shore.</p>
<p>It's <em>15-30 minutes</em> southwest of Minneapolis.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Menomonie / A favorite bicycling destination</h3>
<p>It's hard to beat the Red Cedar State Trail out of Menomonie, Wis.
It's one of the best-maintained crushed-limestone trails in Wisconsin
and also one of the most scenic; it would be rare to ride its 14½ miles
without seeing an eagle, heron, hawk or wild turkey.</p>
<p>The trail ends in the Dunnville Wildlife Area, where the Red Cedar River
runs into the bigger Chippewa.</p>
<p>But bicyclists can continue riding on the seal-coated Chippewa River
State Trail, either 23½ miles east into Eau Claire or 6½ miles south
into Durand. And if you're ambitious, you can <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/red-cedar-trail-menomonie/">bicycle AND paddle the
river</a>.</p>
<p>If there's time, visit three attractions along Wisconsin 25. The Eau
Galle Cheese Factory is a mile and a half north of Durand, and the
Caddie Woodlawn Home and Park, where the famous children's-books
heroine lived, is just west of Dunnville (see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/caddie-woodlawn/">The first American
Girl</a> ).</p>
<p>In Downsville, learn about the logging era at the Empire in Pine Lumber
Museum.</p>
<p>To get to the Red Cedar, drive through Menomonie on Wisconsin 25 and
turn west on Wisconsin 29. The trail starts on the west side of the
river.</p>
<p>It's <em>one hour</em> east of St. Paul.</p>

<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/">Northfield /</a> Colleges and a famous crime</h3>
<p>Northfield's quiet demeanor belies a fiesty past.</p>
<p>In 1876, it rebuffed Jesse James and the Younger Brothers when they
tried to rob the First National Bank, sending the gang packing, minus
two.</p>
<p>The economist who coined the term &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; came
from Northfield, and the late Sen. Paul Wellstone, champion of the
little guy, taught a generation of students at Carleton College.</p>
<p>On the other side of town, St. Olaf College is world-renowned for its
music program and offers free recitals and concerts to the public.</p>
<p>Browse in the shops on Division Street downtown. At the <a href="http://www.northfieldhistory.org/">Northfield
Historical Society Museum</a>, learn
about the infamous bank raid.</p>
<p>Hike in Carleton's <a href="http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/arb/">Arboretum</a>,
or &quot;Arb,&quot; on the floodplain of the Cannon River, or at  nearby
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/nerstrand_big_woods/index.html">Nerstrand Big Woods State
Park</a>, famous for its displays of spring wildflowers.</p>
<p>On the weekend after Labor Day, don't miss <a href="http://www.djjd.org/">Defeat of Jesse James
Days</a>, especially the re-enactments.</p>
<p>It's <em>45 minutes</em> south of the Twin Cities.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_city_paddlewheeler.jpg" alt="The Pearl of the Lake cruise boat." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From Lake City, the Pearl of the Lake paddlewheeler gives tours of Lake
Pepin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/driving-lake-pepin/">Lake Pepin</a> / Eating and exploring</h3>
<p>Since the first explorers came, saw and spread the word, Lake Pepin has
been known for scenery. But these days, many people are going just to
eat.</p>
<p>In Red Wing, pick up sandwiches to go at <a href="https://wisteria-twig-tea-room.square.site/">Wisteria
Twig</a> tea room on Old
West Main and take it up to Barn Bluff for a picnic with a view.</p>
<p>At the north end of Lake City, the <a href="http://www.pearlofthelake.com/">Pearl of the
Lake</a> paddlewheeler gives cruises on the
lake.</p>
<p>Across the bridge in Wisconsin, the Nelson Cheese Factory always is
worth a stop for its ice cream, imported delicacies and, now, a wine
bar.</p>
<p>In Pepin, there's the very popular <a href="http://www.harborviewpepin.com/">Harbor
View Cafe</a> (it doesn't take reservations).</p>
<p>In the bluffs above tiny
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/stockholm-lake-pepin/">Stockholm</a>, A to Z Produce attracts crowds on Tuesdays for <a href="https://www.atozproduceandbakery.com/pizza">Pizza
Night</a>, with pies made
with farm vegetables and meats and baked in wood-fired brick ovens.</p>
<p>In Maiden Rock, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Smiling-Pelican-Bakeshop-116667161693522/">Smiling Pelican
Bakeshop</a>
is famous for pies, tortes, bread and cookies.</p>
<p>It's <em>one hour</em> southeast of the Twin Cities.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stillwater_malts.jpg" alt="Eating ice cream in Stillwater." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Tourists love to stroll and shop in downtown Stillwater.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/st-croix-valley/historic-stillwater-minnesota/">Stillwater</a> / Cruising on the St. Croix</h3>
<p>There's cruising of all kinds in Stillwater. Shoppers troll Main Street
for bibelots and antiques; the <a href="http://www.stillwatertrolley.com/">Stillwater Trolley
Co</a>. prowls residential streets to
give passengers glimpses of elaborately painted Victorians.</p>
<p>On the river, a gondolier rows folks up the St. Croix in a real
<a href="http://www.gondolaromantica.com/">Venetian gondola</a>, providing song
from a real Italian, Luciano Pavarotti, as well as picnic baskets full
of goodies.</p>
<p>The paddlewheelers of the <a href="http://www.stillwaterriverboats.com/">St. Croix Boat and Packet
Co</a>. also cruise the St. Croix
from their moorings near the Dock Cafe.</p>
<p>Go on a Tuesday for <a href="http://www.summertuesdays.com/">Summer Tuesdays: Market, Music,
Movies</a> in Lowell Park on the river.
Families with young children love the fanciful climbing equipment at
<a href="https://www.ci.stillwater.mn.us/Home/Components/FacilityDirectory/FacilityDirectory/10/">Teddy Bear
Park</a>
near downtown.</p>
<p>Stillwater's streets become crowded with tourists on summer and fall
weekends, so go early.</p>
<p>It's <em>30 minutes</em> east of St. Paul.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/u/hudson_sign.jpg" alt="The entrance to Hudson's Lakefront Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/hudson-wisconsin-attractions/">Hudson</a> / Shopping and strolling</h3>
<p>In summer, this Wisconsin river town is a good place to stroll in the
sun.</p>
<p>There's shopping in the historic downtown, with antiques at Abigail
Page Antiques, art at Seasons on St. Croix, chocolates at Knoke's and
gifts at La Rue Marche and Lavender Thymes, among many other shops.</p>
<p>From downtown, visitors can migrate a block down to Lakefront Park,
which has a beach and playground, and walk out onto the 1913 Old Toll
Bridge, which now reaches only partway over the St. Croix.</p>
<p>On Thursday evenings in summer, bands play in the park.</p>
<p>Afterward, stop for a bite at one of the cluster of restaurants on
Second Street — the San Pedro Cafe, the Winzer Stube, Barker's Bar
and Grill or Bricks, for pizza.</p>
<p>It's <em>30 minutes</em> east of St. Paul.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.mantorville.com/">Mantorville</a> /Melodrama on the Zumbro River</h3>
<p>Highbrow it's not. But the theater housed in the 1918 Opera House is as
endearing as an old quilt.</p>
<p>Since 1973, the <a href="http://www.mantorvillain.com/">Mantorville Theater
Company</a> has been having a swell time
putting on melodramas, some of them original, in this tiny village on
the Zumbro River, 15 minutes west of Rochester.</p>
<p>Audiences are encouraged to boo the villains, who are always dastardly,
and cheer the heroes, who are always true and strong.</p>
<p>The town, once a stagecoach stop on the route from the Mississippi to
the western plains, is on the National Register of Historic Places,
including the 1857 <a href="http://www.hubbellhouserestaurant.com/">Hubbell
House</a>. The restaurant has been
visited over the years by such celebrities as Gen. U.S. Grant and Mickey
Mantle and still a popular dining destination.</p>
<p>It's <em>1¼ hours</em> south of the Twin Cities.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_croix_falls_interstate_trail.jpg" alt="A trail in Wisconsin's Interstate Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Interstate State Park in St. Croix Falls, the Pothole Trail follows
the cliff top.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/taylors-falls-minnesota/">Taylors Falls</a> / Potholes and paddlewheelers</h3>
<p>Along the St. Croix River, the last glacier left a playground for young
and old alike.</p>
<p>On both the Minnesota and Wisconsin side, there's an Interstate State
Park. Just south of downtown Taylors Falls, the Minnesota park includes
a jumble of rock, jutting up in slabs and plunging down into potholes,
drilled by swirling bits of glacial debris.</p>
<p>Kids love to explore it (but keep an eye on them). Their elders like to
take a relaxing cruise on the paddlewheelers that leave from the park's
edge, taking their passengers past the famous Dalles of the St. Croix.</p>
<p>In the Interstate State Park across the river, easily reached by walking
across the bridge, the half-mile Pothole Trail marks the start of the
1,000-mile Ice Age National Scenic Trail.</p>
<p>It follows the top of the cliffs, so this is where you'll find
spectacular views of the valley.</p>
<p>It's <em>45 minutes</em> northeast of St. Paul.</p>
<p>Bicyclists have two trails to try. Wisconsin's <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/gandydancer/">Gandy Dancer State
Trail</a> heads north from
the <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/local-visitor-information-centers/polk-county-information-center-192667">Polk County Information
Center</a>, at the foot of the park.</p>
<p>But the Stower Seven Lakes State Trail, which starts in nearby Dresser,
is much more scenic. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/seven-lakes-trail-wisconsin-/">Savoring the Seven
Lakes</a>.</p>
<h3>Grantsburg / Paddling and wildlife-watching</h3>
<p>Not far from the St. Croix River in northwest Wisconsin, native plants
and animals have reclaimed wetlands and brush prairie once drained and
used by settlers.</p>
<p>The land resisted taming, and today, the 30,000 acres of <a href="http://www.crexmeadows.org/">Crex
Meadows</a> Wildlife Area once again belong to
osprey, otters, sandhill cranes, trumpeter swans and all kinds of
migrating fowl.</p>
<p>Wildflowers bloom, wild rice flourishes and visitors are invited to come
out and see nature at its most robust.</p>
<p>A self-guided 24-mile auto tour takes visitors through wetlands, lakes,
prairie and sedge marsh, where the Crex Carpet Co. harvested grass for
rugs from 1912 to 1933. Dawn and dusk are the best times to see
wildlife.</p>
<p>Nearby, rent a canoe from <a href="http://wildriverpaddling.com/">Wild River
Outfitters</a> and paddle down the St.
Croix.</p>
<p>There's also a great hiking trail just five miles west on Wisconsin 70,
in Governor Knowles State Forest.</p>
<p>The trailhead for the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/sacn/planyourvisit/hiking.htm">Sandrock Cliffs
Trail</a>
is right off the highway before it crosses the St. Croix River, and the
bluff-top trail gives hikers views of the river as they walk through a
fragrant forest of red and white pines.</p>
