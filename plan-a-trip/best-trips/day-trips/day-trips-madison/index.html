<h2>See the circus, visit Swiss towns or ride a rail trail: There's fun in every direction.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_lake_lauren.jpg" alt="A view in Devil's Lake State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/madison/">Madison</a>
has the state Capitol, the
largest university, two big lakes and all kinds of attitude. There's
plenty to do if you want to stay put. But sometimes, you just have to
hit the road and explore.</p>
<p>Madison is surrounded by great candidates for a day trip — or a
mini-vacation, if you prefer. It's got cheese country to the south, Old
World towns to the west, bicycle trails on three sides and good eating
all around.</p>
<p>Here are some great ways to spend a day in south-central Wisconsin. If
you get out the door early, do lots of stuff and stay late, it really
will feel like a vacation.</p>
<p>Live closer to Milwaukee? See <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/day-trips/day-trips-milwaukee/">10 great day trips around
Milwaukee</a>.</p>
<p>For more about trips with children, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/kids-in-wisconsin/">Wisconsin for
kids</a>.</p>
<h3>Devil's Lake State Park / Trails and views</h3>
<p>Of all the spectacular landscapes during the last Ice Age, this is
perhaps the most spectacular.</p>
<p>All of Wisconsin flocks to this park just south of the Dells; it's the
most-visited in the state. Climbers test themselves on pink quartzite
cliffs, once the sand along a red ocean.</p>
<p>Scuba divers explore the lake, one of the clearest in Wisconsin. Hikers
walk 500 feet above the lake on the East and West Bluff trails, lined by
haphazardly piled blocks of rock.</p>
<p>With Peninsula State Park in Door County, it's also the most popular
camping park — reserve early. And to avoid the crowds, go early in the
day and during the week.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake/">The divine Devil's
Lake</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake-geology/">High drama
at Devil's
Lake</a>.</p>
<h3>Baraboo / A day at the circus</h3>
<p>This town on the Baraboo River, north of Madison, was the childhood home
of the Ringling Brothers, and it became the winter home of their circus.</p>
<p>The Big Top still lives at <a href="https://www.circusworldbaraboo.org/">Circus World
Museum</a>, where clowns, aerialists
and magicians perform all summer. The Wagon Pavilion, with a world-class
collection of restored circus wagons, and the exhibit hall are open
year-round.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baraboo_circus_parade2.jpg" alt="A daily parade at Circus World." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In summer, there's a daily parade at Circus World.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Cool things to do nearby: Take a ride on the <a href="http://www.midcontinent.org/">Mid-Continent Railway
Museum</a>, 10 miles west in North Freedom.
See the Land of Evermor, a quirky scrap-metal sculpture park, seven
miles south of Baraboo on U.S. 12, behind Delaney's Surplus and across
from the old Badger Army Ammunition Plant.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/circus-world-baraboo/">Baraboo's gilt
complex</a>.</p>
<h3>New Glarus / A Swiss village</h3>
<p>The Swiss-chalet facades of the buildings in this town south of Madison
aren't just for tourists; people really are Swiss. If you're lucky,
you'll catch some yodeling or hear an alphorn concert.</p>
<p>New Glarus always is a great place to eat and drink. Tour the <a href="http://www.newglarusbrewing.com/">New Glarus
Brewing Co.</a> Hilltop Brewery,
which looks like a little European village, and sample its craft beers.</p>
<p>Downtown, pick up handmade sausage at Ruef's Meat Market, European
pastries at New Glarus Bakery and imported chocolate and local cheese at
the Maple Leaf.</p>
<p>Walk around town looking for the 16 artist-painted figures on the <a href="https://www.swisstown.com/new-glarus-cow-parade">Cow
Parade</a>; this is fun
with kids.</p>
<p>Find out why the Swiss got homesick at the <a href="http://www.swisshistoricalvillage.org/">Swiss Historical
Village</a>, an open-air museum of
restored pioneer cabins and buildings. Ride the 23-mile <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/sugarriver/">Sugar River
State Trail</a>, which
intersects with the Badger State Trail in Monticello.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There are lots of festivals, including the Heidi Festival in June,
Wilhelm Tell Festival over Labor Day and Oktoberfest in late September.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-glarus-wisconsin/">Swiss at
heart</a>.</p>
<h3>Lake Mills / Bicycles and beer</h3>
<p>East of Madison, the landscape is pure Wisconsin. The last glacier —
called the Wisconsin glacier because its remnants are easiest to see there —
left hundreds of piles of rubble called drumlins. It's the birthplace
of Trek bicycles. And it's the home of one of Wisconsin's best craft
breweries.</p>
<p>They're all along the Glacial Drumlin State Trail, which stretches 52
miles between Cottage Grove and Waukesha.</p>
<p>In Waterloo, tour the Trek factory.</p>
<p>In Lake Mills, sample Stone Tepee pale ale at Tyranena Brewing, shop at
Ephraim Faience Pottery and plumb the mysteries of Aztalan State Park,
where an ancient people built ceremonial temples.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-glacial-drumlin-trail/">Riding the Glacial
Drumlin</a>.</p>

Historic stone buildings line High Street in Mineral Point.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Mineral Point / Cornish cottages and galleries</h3>
<p>In southwest Wisconsin, this town was booming when Milwaukee was barely
on the map. Lead was discovered here, and the &quot;badger holes&quot; dug by
the first miners gave the state its nickname.</p>
<p>Now, artists occupy limestone cottages and storefronts built by the
first Cornish miners. People who would like to be an artist can take a
workshop at Shake Rag Alley Center for the Arts, which includes
buildings from the 1840s.</p>
<p>Next door, costumed interpreters give tours of the restored miners'
cottages at Pendarvis, across from Merry Christmas Mine.</p>
<p>Don't forget to try a pasty, the miners' favorite lunch, and don't
miss the Saturday-morning markets in Watertower Park, a neighborly
celebration of everything that can be produced or raised by hand.</p>

Point</a>.</p>

<h3>Wisconsin River / A wellspring of naturalists</h3>
<p>On sand plains along the Wisconsin River, Aldo Leopold became a pioneer
of land stewardship. In its marshes and woods, John Muir first
discovered the joys of wilderness. On its meadows, two young
ornithologists created a haven for cranes.</p>
<p>The natural world found some of its greatest allies on a swath of
rolling, glaciated land between Baraboo and Portage.</p>
<p>North of Baraboo, visit the <a href="http://www.savingcranes.org/">International Crane
Foundation</a> and
see lots of whoopers and at least one of every other kind of crane.</p>
<p>Just to the east, tour Aldo Leopold's farm, which includes the famous
<a href="http://www.aldoleopold.org/Visit/Tours.shtml">Shack and the Legacy
Center</a>. Half an hour
farther east, visit John Muir's boyhood home, now <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/local-parks/john-muir-park-191987">John Muir
Park</a>.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/wisconsin-muir-tour/">Pilgrimage to the Baraboo
Hills</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/crane-foundation-wisconsin/">Cranes of
Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<h3>Monroe / Cheese and a bike trail</h3>
<p>The cheese capital of Wisconsin doesn't have the flower boxes and
chalets of New Glarus, but it's every bit as Swiss and maybe more so
— it's the home of the nation's last Limburger factory, and at the
arts center, you can learn Kerbschnitzen — chip carving in wood —
and Scherenschnitten — decorative paper
cutting.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/badger_trail.jpg" alt="Riding the Badger State Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicyclists ride the Badger State Trail north of Monroe.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Tour a cheese factory, visit the Historic Cheesemaking Center and have a
Limburger sandwich at Baumgartner's, on Courthouse Square downtown.</p>
<p>Monroe also makes a good base for riding the Badger State Trail. From
Monroe, it's seven miles to the Illinois border, where the Jane Addams
Trail goes 13 miles into Freeport.</p>
<p>It's 26 miles to the northern trailhead in Fitchburg, and the Badger
connects to the Sugar River State Trail in Monticello.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/cheese-country-wisconsin/">Cheese
country</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/badger-trail-wisconsin/">A slice
of cheese
country</a>.</p>
<h3>Spring Green / Two monuments to ego</h3>
<p>This town on the Wisconsin River has two rather astonishing edifices:
Taliesen, the Frank Lloyd Wright complex that's a tribute to good
taste; and House on the Rock, the overcrowded attic that's a tribute to
. . . a different kind of taste.</p>
<p>Guess which draws more people? Tour both, then spend an evening watching
a Shakespeare play at the American Players Theater, which falls into the
good taste category.</p>
<p>Downtown, visit art galleries and the Spring Green General Store, a
hippie emporium that's moved gracefully into the 21st century. Over
Memorial Day, it puts on a music fest that honors Bob Dylan; over Labor
Day, it honors the Beatles.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_cruise.jpg" alt="Cruise boat in the Dells." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Go on your birthday, when you'll get all kinds of freebies.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/spring-green/">Drawn to Spring
Green</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/spring-green-birthday/">Wisconsin's birthday town</a>.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin Dells / The original attraction</h3>
<p>Today, most people think the Dells are a garish strip lined by
billboards and blinking neon. But the same attractions that drew
tourists in the 19th century still are worth visiting today.</p>
<p>The first tourists came to see the sandstone formations — Black Hawk's
Head, Romance Cliff,  Devil's Elbow — and such spooky recesses as
Witches Gulch. See them on <a href="http://www.wisdells.com/wisconsin-dells-attractions/dells-boat-tours/">Dells Boat
Tours</a>
to the Upper and Lower Dells, or take a <a href="http://www.wisconsinducktours.com/">Wisconsin
Ducks</a> tour on both land and river.</p>
<p>Downtown, visit the H.H. Bennett Museum and Historic Studio, operated by
the pioneering photographer who put the Dells on the map.</p>
<p>North of downtown, take a picnic to the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=283">Dells of the Wisconsin River
state natural
area</a> and
hike down to a sand beach on the river.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/quiet-wisconsin-dells/">The quiet side of the
Dells</a> and

Dells</a>.</p>

Carved trolls line the Trollway in Mount Horeb.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Mount Horeb / A cave and a bike trail</h3>
<p>Just west of Madison, the streets of <a href="http://www.trollway.com">Mount
Horeb</a> are lined with life-size trolls carved
from the trunks of trees, on the Trollway.</p>
<p>Sure enough, early settlers were Norwegian.</p>
<p>Nearby, <a href="http://caveofthemounds.com/">Cave of the Mounds</a> is a good
place to go on a rainy day and also on an unbearably hot day: It's
always a cool 50 degrees. See Onyx Ridge, a 17-foot-tall stalagmite on
which ancient rivulets created the veiled-lady effect used by marble
sculptors.</p>
<p>Walk through winding passageways, past diamond stalactites and columns
that look like the shinbones of a tyrannosaurus.</p>
<p>Go to Mount Horeb for its Summer Frolic in June, Art Fair in July,
Thirsty Troll Brewfest in September or Fall Heritage Festival in
October. There are antiques stores, gift shops, cafes and restaurants
downtown.</p>
<p>Buy cut-rate Land's End catalog returns at the <a href="https://hodancs.org/bargain-nook-stores/">Bargain
Nook</a> (also in New Glarus,
Spring Green, Darlington and Mineral Point).</p>
<p>You can ride to Mount Horeb on the the 40-mile <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/militaryridge/">Military Ridge State
Trail</a>. Take the
Capital City Trail to its trailhead in Fitchburg; from there, it's 15.6
miles to Mount Horeb.</p>
<p>From there, it's another 5.3 miles to <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/bluemound/">Blue Mound State
Park</a>, on the tallest
hill in southern Wisconsin. From the picnic area, climb two observation
towers for a panoramic view of the countryside. If it's a warm day,
cool off in the park's swimming pool.</p>

Horeb</a>.</p>
