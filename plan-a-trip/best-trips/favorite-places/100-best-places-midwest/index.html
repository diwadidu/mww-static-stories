The view from Buena Vista Park in Alma, Wis., is one of the best on the
Mississippi.

<p>As if we didn't have enough pressures in our lives, now we have &quot;1,000
Places to See in U.S. and Canada Before You Die&quot; as well as the
best-selling &quot;1,000 Places to See Before You Die.'</p>
<p>I've been to some of the places listed in those books, but I'll never
see them all in my lifetime. I'll have a fine time reading about them,
though. Then I'll toss some clothes in a bag and be perfectly happy on
my orbits around Lake Superior and the Mississippi.</p>
<p>Our own back yard, while not always glamorous, contains some wonderful
places, and you actually have a good chance of seeing them all in your
lifetime.</p>
<p>If you need a list, here's one of the 100 best places in the Upper
Midwest. When you're finished with it, you'll have so many favorites to
revisit you might not have time for that trip to Bora Bora.</p>
<p>For even more great trips, see our <a href="https://midwestweekends.com/plan_a_trip/index.html">Trip

<p>For trips by season, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/spring-scenery/best-places-spring/">Best of
spring</a>, <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/favorite-places/best-of-summer-midwest/">Best of
summer</a>, <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/favorite-places/best-places-fall/">Best of
fall</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/best-places-winter/">Best of
winter</a>.</p>
<h3>Into the wilderness</h3>
<p>The <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boundary-waters-tips/">Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness</a> is
the only Minnesota entry in the original &quot;1,000 Places,&quot; and of course,
this 1.1 million acre wilderness along Minnesota's border with Canada
deserves the honor.</p>
<p>It's easy to visit on a day trip, but its solitude and wide open spaces
are best appreciated by campers.</p>
<p>The book also lists the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/apostle-islands-kayaking/">Apostle Islands National
Lakeshore</a>
on the south shore of Lake Superior, off
Wisconsin's Bayfield Peninsula. Kayakers have the best access to the
21-island archipelago, but in summer, visitors can take launches to
hiking trails and lighthouses on many of the islands.</p>
<p>In winter, the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/ice-caves-apostles/">ice
caves</a> on
the mainland near Cornucopia, accessible via the frozen lake for a short
time in late winter, are one of the region's most splendid and unusual
sights.</p>
<p>In far northern Minnesota, the labyrinthine waterways of <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/voyageurs-park-boating/">Voyageurs
National
Park</a> are
full of wildlife and history.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/a/galena_cannon.jpg" alt="A cannon in Galena." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Galena's first heyday was before the Civil War, when it was home to
Ulysses S. Grant.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The inland waterways also carried voyageurs and Ojibwe to and from
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/visiting-grand-portage/">Grand Portage National
Monument</a> on
Lake Superior, where interpreters re-create a colorful era; the best
time to go is during the annual Rendezvous in August.</p>
<p>From Grand Portage, ferries take hikers, campers and kayakers to <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/isle-royale-national-park/">Isle
Royale National Park</a></strong>
, a narrow, 45-mile-long island that has 165 miles of hiking trails and
the densest population of moose in the lower 48 states.</p>
<h3>Pilgrimage to prairie</h3>
<p>On the opposite corner of Minnesota, the state's other national monument
is a sacred site to Plains Indians, who still quarry the soft red rock
that lies under quartzite that erupts out of the earth at <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/pipestone-quarries-minnesota/">Pipestone
National
Monument</a>.</p>
<p>This marble-like rock, part of the uplifted floor of an ancient sea,
rises to a 90-foot-high line of cliffs farther south, in dramatic <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/blue-mounds-minnesota/">Blue
Mounds State Park</a>.</p>
<p>Just to the east, it pops out of the sod again at <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/jeffers-petroglyphs/">Jeffers
Petroglyphs</a>, where an ancient people etched their story in nearly 2,000 characters.</p>
<h3>Minnesota's North Shore and Lake Superior</h3>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/duluth-kids/">Duluth's
lakefront</a>,
once bypassed by tourists heading up the North Shore, now is hopping.
The clanging of the steel <strong>Aerial Lift Bridge</strong> brings crowds running
to see freighters
arriving and departing.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's fun to watch boats next to the canal, but the best views are from
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/duluth-skyline-drive/">Skyline Parkway</a>, 500
feet above town on a terrace that once was the beach of Glacial Lake
Duluth.</p>
<p>Heading up the Shore, the cascades of <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/gooseberry-falls/">Gooseberry Falls State
Park</a>
require a stop, as do the view from <strong>Palisade Head</strong>, <strong>Shovel Point</strong>
in Tettegouche State Park and <strong>Split Rock Lighthouse</strong>.</p>
<p>Many of the most popular segments of the <strong><a href="https://superiorhiking.org/">Superior Hiking
Trail</a> are near Lutsen</strong> : Carlton Peak, Oberg Mountain and the
Cascade River. In <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Grand
Marais</a>, visitors flock to the rocky outcropping of Artists Point.</p>
<p>Inland, a hike to <strong>Eagle Mountain</strong> takes
hikers to Minnesota's highest point. On the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/gunflint-trail-winter/">Gunflint
Trail</a>, skiers find 200 kilometers of groomed trails; stop to eat at the
midpoint Trail Center's <strong>Black Bear Bar &amp; Restaurant</strong>, which transcends the usual
skier-snowmobiler antipathies.</p>
<p>It's also a good place to see mushers during the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/beargrease-sled-dog-duluth/">John Beargrease Sled
Dog
Marathon</a>, and outfitters in the area offer dog-sledding trips you can take
yourself.</p>
<p>Back on the North Shore, in Judge C.R. Magney State Park, the <strong>Devil's
Kettle</strong> swallows half of the Brule River;
across the highway,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/naniboujou-lodge-minnesota/">Naniboujou</a> and its
vivid Great Hall offer a fleeting glimpse of Jazz Age days.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/p/apostles_ice_caves_trail3.jpg" alt="Lakeshore Trail to the ice caves." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The mainland ice caves of the Apostles draw crowds in winter.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Grand Portage State Park, the 120-foot <strong>High Falls</strong> on the Pigeon River are Minnesota's
highest waterfall, though they're shared with Ontario.</p>
<p>In <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/thunder-bay-summer/">Thunder
Bay</a></strong> , <strong>Fort
William Historical Park</strong> re-creates the
fur-trade era with astonishing thoroughness. In the Port Arthur
neighborhood, stop for a meal at the <strong>Hoito</strong>, an old Finnish logging-camp restaurant.</p>
<p>Then keep going for the other highlights of the magnificent <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/circle-tour-lake-superior/">Circle Tour
of Lake
Superior</a>,
with non-stop scenery provided by lighthouses, waterfalls and jagged
cliffs.</p>
<p>In Ontario, hike and camp at <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-sleeping-giant-park/">Sleeping Giant Provincial
Park</a>
on the Sibley Peninsula and in <strong>Pukaskwa National Park</strong>. At Agawa Bay, see ancient petroglyphs  .</p>
<p>In Michigan, watch the rise and fall of boats through the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/cruises/soo-locks/">Soo
Locks</a> in Sault Ste. Marie, climb
the Grand Sable Dunes in Grand Marais and see the cliffs of <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/michigan-pictured-rocks-national-lakeshore/">Pictured
Rocks National
Lakeshore</a>
on a cruise out of Munising.</p>
<p>Explore the harbor and copper-mining towns of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/keweenaw-peninsula-michigan/">Keweenaw
Peninsula</a> and hike in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, stop in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/bayfield-summer-wisconsin/">Bayfield</a>
for a show at <strong>Big Top Chautauqua</strong> and
take a detour inland to see the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/wisconsin-waterfalls/"><strong>waterfalls</strong></a> at
Copper Falls, Amnicon and Pattison state parks.</p>
<h3>Sights of Lake Michigan</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pictured_rocks_boat.jpg" alt="A cruise boat along Pictured Rocks." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Cruise boats take tourists to see Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore on
Lake Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>See everything on a <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-circle-tour/">Circle Tour of Lake
Michigan</a>,
one of the nation's great road trips. It's worth the trip just to see
the impossibly picturesque <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/best-sights-mackinac-island/">Mackinac
Island</a>.</p>
<p>If you're on the Straits of Mackinac for Labor Day, take the
once-a-year opportunity to walk across the <strong>Mackinac Bridge</strong> , the world's third-longest suspension
bridge.</p>
<p>On the little finger of the Michigan mitten, <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/sleeping-bear-dunes/">Sleeping Bear Dunes
National
Lakeshore</a> is a
giant sandbox for all ages, the marquee attraction on the Circle Tour.</p>
<p>From there, a <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-lake-michigan/">magnificent stretch of
beaches</a> and resort
towns line the lake, America's freshwater Riviera.</p>
<p>In
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/">Chicago</a>, see everything by bicycling the 18-mile <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-Chicago-Lakefront-Trail/">Lakefront
Trail</a>. Millennium Park and its magnetic Cloud Gate sculpture, or Bean, brings
out the crowds, as does the city's
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/chicago-architecture/">architecture</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a>, be sure to stop by
the spectacular <strong>Milwaukee Art Museum</strong> to
see its brise soleil furl and unfurl. Attend one of its giant <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/summer-milwaukee/">ethnic
festivals</a> on
the lakefront festival grounds â€” Polish, German, Italian, Mexican.</p>
<p>Wisconsin also has lovely beaches and harbor towns. But many people make
a beeline for the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/door-county-outdoors/">Door
Peninsula</a>, a
vacation playground.</p>
<p>If you're there in spring, see the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/door-county-wildflowers/">wildflowers at Ridges
Sanctuary</a> ; in
summer, take the ferry out to <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/rock-island-state-park-wisconsin/">Rock Island State
Park</a>. And <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/door-county-fall/">fall in
Door County</a> is
gorgeous.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/h/phillips_concrete_oxen.jpg" alt="Sculptures in Wisconsin Concrete Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Fred Smith fashioned more than 200 figures at the Wisconsin Concrete
Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Quirky spots in Wisconsin</h3>
<p>In <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/spring-green/">Spring Green</a>, on the Wisconsin River, the Wright masterpiece <strong>Taliesin</strong> can be
visited on tours given by the Frank
Lloyd Wright Visitors Center.</p>
<p>A different kind of spectacle sits on a limestone spire overlooking
Taliesin and its valley; the over-the-top <strong>House on the Rock</strong>
is said to owe its existence to its
builder's desire to spite the haughty architect.</p>
<p>Farther upstream, the fantastical sandstone formations of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/quiet-wisconsin-dells/">Wisconsin
Dells</a> were
created by a 100-foot wall of water at the end of the last Ice Age, the
same kind of deluge that created the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/taylors-falls-minnesota/">Dalles of the St.
Croix</a> at
Taylors Falls.</p>
<p>Signs of the last glacier can be seen best in Wisconsin by hiking around
gorgeous <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake/">Devil's Lake State
Park</a> and on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/ice-age-trail/">Ice
Age National Scenic
Trail</a>  and by exploring the glens and hollows of
the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/wisconsin-muir-tour/">Baraboo
Hills</a>, a
25-mile-long swath recognized as a &quot;Last Great Place&quot; by the Nature
Conservancy.</p>
<p>Not far from the Dells, the <strong>International Crane Foundation</strong>
harbors endangered cranes from around the
world. In Mirror Lake State Park, the <strong>Seth Peterson Cottage</strong> is the one of the only <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/frank-lloyd-wright-sites-wisconsin/">Wright-designed
buildings</a>
the public can rent for private use.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the last century, Wisconsin has been a crucible for many untrained
artists, who work their magic in concrete and shards of glass.
<a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/Wisconsin-folk-art/">Wisconsin's folk-art sculpture
environments</a>
is perhaps the most spectacular in the nation.</p>
<p>In the northern part of the state, see Fred Smith's Wisconsin Concrete
Park in Phillips and the James Tellen Woodland Sculpture Garden near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/sheboygan-wisconsin/">Sheboygan</a>.</p>
<p>In the south, visit the Paul and Matilda Wegner Grotto near Sparta,
Prairie Moon Sculpture Garden and Museum near <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/fountain-city-wisconsin/">Fountain
City</a> and Nick
Engelbert's Grandview between Mineral Point and New Glarus.</p>
<p>All were restored by the Kohler Foundation. The Dickeyville Grotto, in
the southwest tip of the state, is worth a trip as well.</p>
<h3>Coulees and river valleys</h3>
<p>The last glacier slid around southwest Wisconsin and the corners of
southeast Minnesota and northeast Iowa, leaving a maze of ridges and
valleys. It's often called the Driftless Area.</p>
<p>Norwegians settled around Westby; at their annual <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/westby-ski-jumping/">Snowflake
International Ski Jumping
Tournament</a>, Olympic-caliber athletes soar off a 118-meter hill that's one of only
four its size in North America.</p>
<p>In <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/vernon-county-wisconsin/">Vernon
County</a>, the
son of freed slaves left a collection of round barns, and Amish settled
around Cashton and Ontario. On the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kickapoo-river-canoeing-wisconsin/">Kickapoo</a>, paddlers travel in all four directions of the compass in the six miles
between Ontario and Wildcat Mountain State Park.</p>
<p>Nearby, the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/elroy-sparta-bicycle-trail/">Elroy-Sparta State
Trail</a>, with its three tunnels, was the first rail trail in the nation and
still the pride of <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/wisconsin-bike-trails/">Wisconsin's bike
trails</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/madison-with-kids/">Madison</a>, with its blindingly white Capitol, museums and lively State Street
squeezed onto the isthmus between two lakes, is a destination in every
season. Some derisively call it an oasis from reality, and many think
that's a good thing.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stpaul_summit_avenue.jpg" alt="Summit Avenue in St. Paul." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
St. Paul's Summit Avenue has one of the best collections of Victorian
mansions in the nation.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Just to the south, the Swiss settled around <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-glarus-wisconsin/">New
Glarus</a>  and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/cheese-country-wisconsin/">Monroe</a> and built an
empire of cheese; today, a Limburger-and-onion sandwich at Baumgartner's
in Monroe confers instant cheesehead status.</p>
<p>The lead-mining town of <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/mineral-point-art-tour/">Mineral
Point</a>
drew miners from Cornwall, and its stone facades bear their mark. Their
heritage is preserved at the Pendarvis historic site, and art studios
and galleries line High Street.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/galena-getaway/">Galena</a></strong>,
another lead-mining town across the
border in Illinois, also is a magnet for artists, shoppers and Civil War
history buffs.</p>
<p>In Iowa, limestone chimney spires and towering bluffs amaze paddlers on
the <strong>Upper Iowa River</strong> near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/decorah-iowa-norwegian-heritage/">Decorah</a>, a bastion of Norwegian heritage.</p>
<p>In nearby
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadtrips/burr-oak-spillville-decorah-iowa/">Spillville</a></strong>
, where composer Antonin Dvorak spent the summer of 1893, the <strong>Bily
Clock Exhibit</strong> shows what two Bohemian
bachelor farmers could whittle over the long, lonely winters.</p>
<p>In <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/minnesota-caves/">cave country</a>
across the border in Minnesota, <strong>Niagara Cave</strong> near Harmony and <strong>Mystery Cave</strong>
near Preston show what drops of water can
do over a few long eons. Tour guides offer trips to the many <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/guided-trips/amish-tours-minnesota/">Amish
farms</a>.</p>
<p>Nearby,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Lanesboro</a>
is a magnet for bicyclists, who come to ride the lovely Root River State
Trail.</p>
<p>The Mississippi looms large in this region, populated by the spirits of
Dakota warriors, French explorers and steamboat captains.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinac_island_wagon.jpg" alt="A horse-drawn wagon on Mackinac." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>The best <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mississippi-river-views/">views of the Mississippi
River</a>  give a sense of its scope and power: Barn
Bluff in Red Wing; Buena Vista Park in Alma; Brady's Bluff in Perrot
State Park, near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Trempealeau</a>
; Mount Hosmer in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/lansing-iowa-mississippi/">Lansing</a>, in northeast
Iowa; Pikes Peak State Park near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mcgregor-iowa/">McGregor</a> ; and
Wyalusing State Park near <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/prairie-du-chien/">Prairie du
Chien</a>.</p>
<h3>Chasing wildlife</h3>
<p>Wildlife watchers look for different kinds of views. At
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/birds-horicon-marsh-wisconsin/">Horicon Marsh</a></strong>
in southeast  Wisconsin, thousands of warblers and many other waterfowl stop in
spring, and geese descend in fall.</p>
<p>In November, hundreds of <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagles-wabasha/">tundra
swans</a> create a
spectacular sight along the Mississippi near Brownsville, Minn., and
Rieck's Park in Alma, Wis.</p>
<p>Across the river, in Wabasha and Read's Landing,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagle-watching-mississippi-river/">eagle-watching</a>
reaches its zenith between December and March.</p>
<p>On the Mississippi north of the Twin Cities, more than 1,000 <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/swans-monticello-minnesota/">trumpeter
swans</a> spend the winter at
Swan Park in Monticello.</p>
<p>And in April, hundreds flock to blinds in central Wisconsin to watch
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/prairie-chicken-festival/">prairie-chicken
courtship</a>.</p>
<p>To the east, black bears frequent <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/orr-bear-sanctuary-minnesota/">Vince Shute Wildlife
Sanctuary</a>
near Orr, thrilling visitors in summer.</p>

<p>At the <strong>International Wolf Center</strong> in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-ely-minnesota-summer/">Ely</a>,
resident wolves showcase the alpha and omega of lupine behavior. On the
other side of Ely, the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/ely-bear-center/">North American Bear
Center</a>  is the place to learn about bruins.</p>
<h3>Minnesota lakes country</h3>
<p>The headwaters of the Mississippi, in <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/itasca-park-tips/">Itasca State
Park</a>, are a magnet
for schoolchildren around the nation; stay at the Douglas Lodge, which
has been housing park visitors since 1905.</p>
<p>From there, the Mississippi heads north to
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/bemidji-bunyan-minnesota/">Bemidji</a>, crossing Lake Bemidji near the nation's first giant mascots, Paul
Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox, which have been drawing camera-toting
tourists since 1937.</p>
<p>The 106-mile <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/paul-bunyan-trail/">Paul Bunyan State
Trail</a>
connects Bemidji to
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/brainerd-minnesota-summer/">Brainerd</a>, the state's busiest lake-resorts area in summer.</p>
<p>One of Minnesota's newest attractions cuts through the best of the Iron
Range. Riding the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/mesabi-trail/">Mesabi
Trail</a>  between Grand Rapids and Eveleth will be a
revelation to anyone who hasn't seen an emerald-green mine-pit lake or
such <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/iron-range-attractions/">Iron Range
sights</a> as Virginia's <strong>Mineview in the Sky</strong>
or <strong>Hill Annex Mine State Park</strong> in Calumet.</p>
<p>The Mesabi Trail eventually will reach Tower, site of <strong>Soudan
Underground Mine State Park</strong> , where
visitors get into an elevator and descend the equivalent of seven
football fields into the Earth.</p>
<h3>The Twin Cities</h3>
<p>In the Twin Cities, no Minnesotan is worth his salt if he hasn't done
the basics. In Minneapolis, walk or bike along the river and lakes on
the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-minneapolis-grand-rounds/">Grand
Rounds</a>. On the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/minneapolis-riverfront/">riverfront</a>, walk across the Stone Arch Bridge and see a play at the <strong>Guthrie
Theater.</strong></p>
<p>South of downtown, visit <strong>Minnehaha
Falls</strong> and then cross the river to drive
along St. Paul's <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/summit-avenue-st-paul/">Summit
Avenue</a>
and ogle the beautifully preserved Victorian mansions.</p>
<p>I wouldn't include a big shopping mall even if it is the <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-mall-america/">Mall of
America</a>, but they say it's the state's No. 1 attraction.</p>
<h3>Festivals</h3>
<p>To see the cities at their best, go to <strong>Minneapolis' Aquatennial</strong>
in July, one of the best <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/midwest-summer-festivals/">summer
festivals</a>, and
see the ice sculptures during <strong>St. Paul's Winter Carnival</strong>, one of the best <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/winter-festivals-midwest/">winter
festivals</a>.</p>
<p>In February, the Luminary Loppet on Minneapolis' <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/minneapolis-chain-lakes/">Chain of
Lakes</a>
is one of the most magical things you can do in winter, along with
dozens of other <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/candlelight-ski-snowshoe-events/">candlelight skiing and
snowshoeing</a>
evenings around the region.</p>
<p>Minnesotans, of course, must go to the <a href="http://www.mnstatefair.org/">Minnesota State
Fair</a>, Iowans to the <a href="http://www.iowastatefair.org/">Iowa State
Fair</a> and everyone in Wisconsin to the
<a href="http://www.wistatefair.com/index.html">Wisconsin State Fair</a>, all in
August.</p>
<p>Cheeseheads also must attend at least one game at <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/green-bay-kids/">Lambeau
Field</a> in
Green Bay (if they can get a ticket).</p>
<p>Norwegians must go to July's <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/nordic-fest-decorah/">Nordic
Fest</a> in Decorah, and
Nordic skiers must sign up for at least one <strong>Birkebeiner</strong> or Korteloppet from Cable to Hayward,
Wis., in February.</p>
<p>Everyone should attend a few
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/powwows-wacipi-upper-midwest/">powwows</a>,
and it would be a shame to miss the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/lumberjacks-hayward/">Lumberjack World
Championships</a>
in Hayward in July.</p>
<p>Also be sure to catch the September <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/civil-war-wade-house/">Civil War battle
re-enactments</a>
at the Wade House in Greenbush, Wis.;
May's <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/pella-tulip-time-festival/">Tulip Time in
Pella</a>, Iowa; or, in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/winnipeg-manitoba/">Winnipeg</a>, the fabulous Folk Festival in July and Folklorama in August.</p>
<p>It shouldn't take a lifetime to polish off this list â€” but if it does,
I'd consider it a lifetime well-spent.</p>
