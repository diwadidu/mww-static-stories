<h2>The chase is on as autumn colors start to coat the countryside.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_lake_hiker.jpg" alt="Hiking in Devil's Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We always get a little frantic in fall, trying to make the most of a
too-brief window of opportunity.</p>
<p>Fall is the best time for a lot of things: hiking, after frost has
knocked off the bugs; road trips, when the countryside is at its
loveliest; and wildlife-watching, when birds and beasts are on the move.</p>
<p>Plus, it's gorgeous. Most people try to catch the reds and oranges of
maples at peak, but tamaracks, tallgrass and oaks keep things glowing
through October.</p>
<p>Here are our picks for the best things to see and do this fall.</p>
<h3>Best hiking trail</h3>
<p>In early fall, any hike through maple forest will be spectacular. But
only one place is even more striking after leaves have fallen — the
<a href="http://www.iceagetrail.org">Ice Age National Scenic Trail</a> across
Wisconsin.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Nearly everyone in the state and many people in Minnesota and Illinois
live within a hour of this 1,000-mile trail, which winds through the
north woods but dips as far south as Janesville before heading for Door
County.</p>
<p>In late fall, all of its odd features can be seen — lone boulders
called erratics and the conical hills, high ridges and long hillocks
known as kames, eskers and drumlins.</p>
<p>Many of the state's best-known hikes are part of the trail, at Devil's
Lake State Park, around Wausau and in Kettle Moraine State Forest. For
more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/best-hikes-ice-age-trail/">Greatest hits of the Ice
Age</a>.</p>
<p>One of the season's best scheduled hikes is the <a href="https://www.iceagetrail.org/event/chippewa-moraine-parade-of-colors-fall-hike/">Parade of Colors Fall
Hike</a>
from the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/chipmoraine/">Chippewa Moraine Ice Age
Center</a> in New Auburn,
Wis., the first Saturday in October. Volunteers drop off hikers for a
scenic hike back to the center.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/midwest-fall-hikes/">30 classic fall
hikes</a>.</p>
<h3>Best bicycle trail</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/u/munger_trail_fall.jpg" alt="Fall colors on the Munger Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A family rides the Munger State Trail in eastern Minnesota.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In fall, nearly every bicycle trail is lined with brilliant red sumac
and colorful clumps of wildflowers. But not every trail can supply
coots, cormorants and great blue herons, as well.</p>
<p>In southwest Wisconsin, the 24-mile <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/great-river-trail/">Great River State
Trail</a>
starts in Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge and along the marshy
bottomlands of the Upper Mississippi River National Fish and Wildlife
Refuge. You can expect plenty of herons, turtles and various wildlife.</p>
<p>This area also has a lot of orchards, and <a href="http://www.galesvillewi.com/appleaffair.php">Apple
Affair</a> in nearby
Galesville, the first Saturday in October, includes a family-friendly
20-mile cruise through apple orchards as well as longer routes through
the bluffs.</p>
<p>If you're dying to see fall colors in Wisconsin's north woods, try the
<a href="https://boulderjct.org/the-heart-of-vilas-county-bike-trail-system/">Heart of Vilas County
trails</a>
through Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest near <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/boulder-junction/">Boulder
Junction</a>,
which holds a <a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/events/fairs-festivals/harvest-fest-38882">Harvest
Fest</a>
the second Saturday of October.</p>
<p>While you're there, ride or drive the 12 miles between Boulder Junction
and Star Lake on scenic <a href="http://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr60.aspx">Rustic Road
60</a>.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/best-bicycle-trails-fall/">15 great trails to ride in
fall</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Best shopping</h3>
<p>Since the holidays still are months away, why not shop and enjoy a
leisurely drive at the same time?</p>
<p>In fall, artists say goodbye to the art-fair circuit and let their
patrons come to them on <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/art-fairs/midwest-fall-art-tours/">studio
tours</a>.
Luckily, artists tend to live in the kinds of places you'd want to
visit anyway in the fall.</p>
<p>The biggest and oldest tour is the <a href="http://www.fallarttour.com">Southwest Wisconsin Fall Art
Tour</a>, held
the third weekend of October in the scenic countryside between Mineral
Point, Spring Green and Baraboo.</p>
<p>The problem with this tour is you're likely to be distracted by
everything else in that area — near Baraboo, <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake/">Devil's Lake State
Park</a>, where colors
should be spectacular that weekend, and in <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/spring-green/">Spring
Green</a>, the home
of House on the Rock, Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin and the American
Players Theatre.</p>
<p>Just try to stay focused. And if you miss the September and October
studio tours, head for
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-madison/">Madison</a>,
which has great holiday markets in November.</p>
<h3>Best fall colors</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porcupines_waterfalls_fall.jpg" alt="Waterfall in the Porkies." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Fall is gorgeous in Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you want to see fall colors at their peak, you have to keep moving.</p>
<p>In late September, head for the hardwood forests in the north woods in
late September — my pick is <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State
Park</a>
in the Upper Peninsula.</p>
<p>Then head south, picking up tamarack golds in northern bogs and oak
russets on southern ridges.</p>
<p>The best color I've seen has been chasing <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/marinette-waterfalls/">waterfalls in northeast
Wisconsin</a> (late
September) and <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-cable-wisconsin/">hiking around
Cable</a> in northwest
Wisconsin (early October), <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake/">Devil's Lake State
Park</a> in
south-central Wisconsin (mid-October) and Whitewater State Park in
southeast Minnesota (late October).</p>
<p>For more tips on where to find fall color, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/finding-fall-colors/">Pursuing the
hues</a>.</p>
<h3>Best birding</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_goshawk_release.jpg" alt="A birder releases a goshawk on Hawk Ridge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A birder releases a goshawk from Hawk Ridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On Duluth's <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/hawk-watching-duluth/">Hawk
Ridge</a>, waves of
broad-winged and sharp-shinned hawks in September give way to red-tailed
hawks and northern goshawks in October. From mid-August to November,
nearly 100,000 raptors migrate over this Lake Superior ridgeline.</p>
<p>Volunteer naturalists are there every day to talk about the birds and
lend binoculars. On weekends, they offer such programs as &quot;Eyes on the
Skies: Hawk-watching for Beginners.&quot;</p>
<p>If you're lucky, they'll also show you a hawk close-up, after it's
been caught and banded. And if you're really lucky, you'll get to be the one
who releases it back to the sky.</p>
<p>There are concession stands, too; many people hang out there for hours.</p>
<p>In southeast Wisconsin, you'll see shore birds on <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/birds-horicon-marsh-wisconsin/">Horicon
Marsh</a>, often called
the &quot;little Everglades of the north.&quot; Paddle onto it yourself or go
on pontoon-boat tours with an outfitter.</p>
<h3>Best road trip</h3>
<p>Fall is a great time to see for yourself that Iowa is not flat. Head for
the bluff country around Decorah, missed by the last four glaciers, and
you'll also see that Iowa is not boring.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_seed_savers.jpg" alt="Seed Savers Exchange near Decorah." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Seed Savers Exchange near Decorah, visit the gift shop for a dazzling
array of unusual seeds.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Unusual people lived and worked among these wooded ridges and valleys.
Composer Antonin Dvorak and the wood-carving Bily brothers lived in
Spillville.</p>
<p>Laura Ingalls Wilder lived for a year in Burr Oak, a time so traumatic
she never wrote about it. A slew of scholars and Norwegian-heritage
preservationists live in Decorah.</p>
<p>One of the most picturesque places is just north of Decorah, where <a href="http://www.seedsavers.org/">Seed
Savers Exchange</a> grows and preserves
heirloom seeds from around the world.</p>
<p>On the second weekend of October, Decorah is the hub for the <a href="http://www.iowaarttour.com">Northeast
Iowa Artists' Studio Tour</a>, with more than
50 studios within 35 miles of town.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadtrips/burr-oak-spillville-decorah-iowa/">Road trip: Northeast
Iowa</a>.</p>
<p>For leaf color, head east to the <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/great-river-road/northeast-iowa-fall/">Iowa towns along the Mississippi
River</a>, one of the
region's most beautiful places in fall.</p>
<h3>Best living history</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/norskedalen_confederate_home.jpg" alt="Civil War Weekend at Norskedalen." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
During Norskedalen's reenactments, a Confederate soldier tells a
Southern woman she must leave her home.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This is an easy pick: the annual <a href="https://www.norskedalen.org/events/civil-war-immersion-weekend/">Civil War
Experience</a>
at <a href="http://www.norskedalen.org">Norskedalen</a>, a pioneer heritage center
in  the coulees of southwest Wisconsin.</p>
<p>No one is better at showing the misery of war than the members of
Company B of the Second Wisconsin, part of the famous Iron Brigade,
whose living-history re-enactments can leave onlookers nearly in tears.</p>
<p>Their venue is the Bekkum Homestead, a collection of 13 buildings from
19th-century Norwegian pioneer farms that stands in for rural farms in
the South. In their scenario, the Yankees are coming, and the farm folk
suffer as much as soldiers.</p>
<p>Onlookers are right there as soldiers tell women and children they must
flee and as wounded soldiers scream in pain.</p>
<p>If you're there at the right time — or the wrong time, if you have a
sensitive stomach — you might see an army &quot;butcher,&quot; or doctor, cauterize a
wound, with sputtering chicken fat standing in for human flesh.</p>
<p>It's the second weekend of October. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/civil-war-battle-renactments-norskedalen/">Civil War, up
close</a>.</p>
<p>For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/vernon-county-wisconsin/">Valleys of Vernon
County</a>.</p>
<h3>Best train ride</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_harbors_lighthouse_fall.jpg" alt="The Two Harbors lighthouse on Lake Superior." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The train trip to Two Harbors includes a two-hour layover.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>You have to reserve far in advance to be one of the lucky people who
gets to ride the <a href="http://www.northshorescenicrailroad.org/">North Shore Scenic
Railroad</a>
from <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/train-ride-two-harbors/">Duluth to Two
Harbors</a> on
fall weekends.</p>
<p>The 52-mile, six-hour round trip isn't a little dead-end excursion into
the countryside; it's a real train trip to a real town, where you'll
have two hours to explore.</p>
<p>Across from the depot, you may get to see an ore boat loading taconite
pellets at giant docks, and you can see the 1896 tug Edna G., the St.
Bernard of the North Shore.</p>
<p>Across the bay, there's an 1892 red-brick lighthouse. From there, walk
to the end of the breakwall or on the Sonju Trail, which follows the
lake across beautiful Lighthouse Point.</p>
<p>Other railroads also offer fall-color excursions, including the Lake
Superior &amp; Mississippi Railroad in West Duluth, which follows the St.
Louis River.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/vintage-trains/train-rides-midwest/">Riding the
rails</a>.</p>
<h3>Best eating</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/p/ephraim_wilsons.jpg" alt="Wilson's ice-cream parlor in Ephraim." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Wilson's has been in Ephraim since 1906.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This time of year, a lot of people get the urge to go to a fish boil and
stop by a farm market for some apple pie and cherry cider.</p>
<p>If that's you, head for <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/door-county-fall/">Door
County</a>, which is all
about eating this time of year. Think about what it's most famous for:
Fish boils. Wineries. Cherry pie.</p>
<p>In fact, many of its best-known landmarks are places to eat: Wilson's
Ice Cream Parlor in Ephraim, famous for its old-fashioned soda fountain,
and <a href="http://www.aljohnsons.com/">Al Johnson's Swedish Restaurant</a> in
Sister Bay, where goats roam on the sod roof and people stand in line
for pancakes with lingonberries.</p>
<p>Go on a <a href="http://www.doorcounty.com/dine/ice-cream/">sundae drive</a>,
which includes frozen custard in Fish Creek and gelato in Ephraim; tour
<a href="https://www.doorcountywinetrail.com/">eight wineries</a> between Algoma
and Fish Creek; or pick one of nearly a dozen <a href="https://www.doorcounty.com/dine/fish-boils/">fish
boils</a>.</p>
<p>For apples and locally made jams, pies, maple syrup, visit a farm
market, including Koepsel's in Baileys Harbor, Wood Orchard Market in
Egg Harbor, Orchard Country in Fish Creek and Seaquist Orchards north of
Sister Bay.</p>
<p>And don't forget to bring a cooler.</p>
<h3>Best place for solitude</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/trempealeau_seven_bridges_summer.jpg" alt="Seven Bridges Road." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The quiet Seven Bridges Road trail crosses Mississippi sloughs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This time of year, there are throngs of hikers on such well-known trails
as the Oberg Mountain loop on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">North
Shore</a>, which
doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.</p>
<p>But if you're looking for solitude, try the four-mile <a href="http://www.7bridgesrd.org/">Seven Bridges
Road</a>, in Van Loon Wildlife Area near the
southwest Wisconsin river town of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Trempealeau</a>.</p>
<p>Built on a raised bed through floodplain forest, the road once led to
the settlement of McGilvray's Ferry on the Black River, near its mouth
on the Mississippi. It's lined with five 1905 bowstring-arch truss
bridges, all on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>Along with a 1921 truss bridge, they give hikers an enchanting passage
through a world from which all other signs of civilization have
vanished. Bald-eagle sightings are likely year-round.</p>
<p>To get there, drive seven miles east of Trempealeau on Wisconsin 35 and
turn left on Amsterdam Prairie Road. The parking lot is a mile up on the
left. It's a 3.7-mile hike to the Black River and back.</p>
