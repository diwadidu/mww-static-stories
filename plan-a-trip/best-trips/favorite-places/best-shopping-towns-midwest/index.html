Stillwater's main street is lined with shops selling gifts, books and

<p>There are certain towns that are so adorable and have so much that
appeals to tourists that you just have to call them show towns.</p>
<p>They're real towns, of course, but they're always on their best
behavior because tourists are always watching, and many have evolved in
lockstep with tourism.</p>
<p>There's no question about what goes on the top of this list —
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/galena-getaway/">Galena, Ill</a>. This
1850s lead-mining boom town snoozed for a century before it was
rediscovered and turned into a playground for weekenders, especially
from Chicago.</p>
<p>They dabble in history, but they dive into shopping; boutiques line Main
Street, and the hillsides are dotted with 50 B&amp;Bs.</p>
<p>It's a great place to visit — especially midweek and in April, May
and September, when it's a little less crowded.</p>
<p>Galena also is a good spot for shoppers who like the outdoors; there's
canoeing on the Galena River, bird-watching expeditions and hiking and
bicycling on the short but scenic Galena River Trail. For more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/outdoors-sports-galena/">Outdoors in
Galena</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/st-croix-valley/historic-stillwater-minnesota/">Stillwater,
Minn.</a></strong>
is not as well-known, but Twin Citians
know and love it. It's the perfect weekend destination, with a
picturesque riverfront setting, hills lined with grand Victorian houses
and storefronts stuffed with antiques, gifts and antiquarian books.</p>
<p>It's the most fun in summer, when paddlewheelers, gondolas and party
boats cruise the St. Croix, but you'll find the most bargains in
winter. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-stillwater-minnesota/">Bargain-hunting in
Stillwater</a>.</p>
<p>Down the Mississippi, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Red Wing,
Minn.</a>, is the
other weekend favorite for people from the Twin Cities, though it's
just far enough away to retain a genuine small-town atmosphere.</p>
<p>It has shopping downtown and in the historic Pottery Place mall and an
interesting history, as well as nightlife at the splendid Sheldon
Theatre and hiking on Barn Bluff.</p>
<p>In late September, artists throw open their doors for the Studio Ramble.
Of course, the town also is renowned for its pottery and hosts the
annual convention of the Red Wing Collectors Society.</p>
<p>There are even more shops and galleries across the river in Stockholm,
Wis.; see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/stockholm-lake-pepin/">Destination:
Stockholm</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/northfield_shop_woman.jpg" alt="Shops in Northfield." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Northfield, unique shops line Division Street.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Less than an hour south of the Twin Cities, the town of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/">Northfield</a>
has many of the sophisticated, eclectic shops you'd expect in a town
that's home to two highly ranked colleges, Carleton and St. Olaf.</p>
<p>It's one of the best places to shop for clever little stocking stuffers
and has excellent home-decor and antiques shops. And after you've spent
all your money shopping, take in a free concert at St. Olaf, whose music
program is world renowned.</p>
<p>Just down the St. Croix River from Stillwater, the Wisconsin town of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/hudson-wisconsin-attractions/">Hudson</a> is
low-key but filled with interesting shops. If you can't resist fine
chocolate and you love stylishly unusual shoes, hang on to your wallet.</p>
<p>This town also has a very good selection of cafes and restaurants, and
the riverfront Phipps Center for the Arts puts on plays, concerts and
art exhibits. In summer, bring a swim suit and hang out on its sand
beach, a block from the shops.</p>
<p>Like Stillwater, <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/cedarburg-wisconsin/">Cedarburg,
Wis.</a>, is
well-loved by residents of a nearby metropolitan area, and even more
neglected nationally.</p>
<p>But the picturesque little mill town near Milwaukee has everything a
weekender could want — a restored woolen mill filled with shops and a
winery, a main street lined with more shops, inns in renovated historic
buildings, a bicycle trail, lots of festivals, even a covered bridge.
What's not to like?</p>
<p>It also holds festivals all year long that pull in crowds.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin's <strong>Door County</strong> , <em>Fish
Creek</em> is a shopper's idea of heaven on water. In summer, its sidewalks
are crowded with tourists and its air perfumed by candles and fancy
soaps from the many shops.</p>
<p>Just up the shoreline, <em>Ephraim</em> is eye candy for tourists who can't
resist the red-and-white awnings of Wilson's Restaurant, framed by the
white steeple of the church on the hill; it, too, has many shops and
galleries.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There are even more galleries on pastoral county roads near the two
towns.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/">Door County
stories</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/e/red_wing_downtown.jpg" alt="Downtown Red Wing at the base of Barn Bluff." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Downtown Red Wing is a favorite destination for Twin Citians.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In southwest Wisconsin, historic <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/mineral-point-art-tour/">Mineral
Point</a>
is full of galleries and artist studios, which occupy picturesque
limestone storefronts along sloping High Street and on Commerce Street.</p>
<p>Shake Rag Alley Center for the Arts teaches people how to make their own
art, in October, Mineral Point is ground zero for the big Fall Art Tour
in October. Lodgings include plenty of nifty cottages.</p>
<p>Not far away on the Wisconsin River, <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/spring-green/">Spring
Green</a> also has
drawn artists from around the region and also is part of the Fall Art
Tour.</p>
<p>Tourists can choose from highbrow culture (Frank Lloyd Wright's
highbrow Taliesen, American Players Theatre) and kitsch (House on the
Rock); there's plenty to do.</p>
<p>And if it's your birthday, plan to rake in the free treats. For more,
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/spring-green-birthday/">Wisconsin's birthday
town</a>.</p>
<p>It's a jaunt, but three towns in <em>northern</em> <em>Missouri</em> are well worth a
visit. Just outside St. Louis, <a href="http://www.historicstcharles.com">St.
Charles</a> has a boatload of history;
it's the spot where Lewis and Clark picked up their final crew and
supplies for their historic expedition. It also has many excellent
shops, inns and bistros, and there's a history lesson on every corner.</p>
<p>Not far from St. Louis, the town of <a href="http://www.hermannmo.com">Hermann</a>
is the Missouri equivalent of Galena; it has so many B&amp;Bs that owners of
private homes in the historic district have to post signs advising
tourists they're not a B&amp;B.</p>
<p>It's a stop on the Katy Trail, the longest bicycle trail in the nation,
and its many wineries and festivals keep the town hopping.</p>
<p>Just outside Kansas City, the quiet old port town of
<a href="http://www.westonmo.com">Weston</a> has a more violent history; it often
bore the brunt of skirmishes between slave owners and abolitionists from
Kansas, just across the Missouri River.</p>
<p>It's still a tobacco market today and remarkably unchanged; tourists
come for the atmosphere as well as the shops, museums, 1850s distillery
and winery, which sells excellent mead.</p>
