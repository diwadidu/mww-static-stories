<p>Patricia Schultz's best-selling book &quot;1,000 Places to See Before You
Die&quot; was grand entertainment for armchair travelers. It's unlikely that
many people read the book, then ran off to raft the Mangoky River in
Madagascar or bask on the beaches of Bora Bora. But she let us dream
about it.</p>
<p>The New York writer's next book, however, was about places to which
people might actually go — and about places they know. It's called
&quot;1,000 Places to See in the U.S. and Canada Before You Die.&quot;</p>
<p>She couldn't visit every place she chose, so she relied on the help of
friends and relatives, other travel writers, the Internet and tourism
bureaus.</p>
<p>&quot;Over time, you develop radar,&quot; Schultz said. &quot;I  like to think that,
to some degree, I have a sensitivity to the inherent specialness of
places.&quot;</p>
<p>She's been to Wisconsin twice in her life, she said, and to Minnesota
four times.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a late convert to Minnesota and the Midwest,&quot; she said. &quot;I was
astounded by the beauty. I like the Midwest, and I'd like to know it
better.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Her U.S. and Canada book includes 12 entries in Minnesota and 18 in
Wisconsin.</p>
<p>So how did she do?</p>
<p>To people who know the area well, the entries will sound vaguely
tone-deaf. Is Minneapolis really the heart of hockey country?</p>
<p>Few would consider Afton a farming town, and Laura Ingalls Wilder's
birthplace is not Alma, Wis. The Brainerd Lakes do not generate nearly
half of Minnesota's resort revenue.</p>
<p>And many will roll their eyes at her lodgings choices, the same old,
same old hotels also recommended by every other national travel writer
not because they're best, but because they've been around the longest</p>
<ul>
<li>the Lowell Inn in Stillwater, the St. James in Red Wing, the Old
Rittenhouse in Bayfield.</li>
</ul>
<p>But with a few notable exceptions, Schultz's recommendations are pretty
good. Besides, they're meant to be a guideline, not a mandate.</p>
<p>Here they are, in the order she lists them.</p>

places</a> and other <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/favorite-places/">Favorite Places</a>
stories.</p>
<h3>MINNESOTA</h3>
<p><em>Mall of America</em> : Don't tourists have anywhere better to go?
Apparently not. This is Minnesota's No. 1 tourist attraction, according
to Explore Minnesota Tourism, so it gets a spot on the list.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_spoonbridge.jpg" alt="Spoonbridge and Cherry in Minneapolis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Spoonbridge and Cherry is the best-known piece in the Minneapolis
Sculpture Garden, next to Walker Art Center.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Brainerd Lakes</em> : This area was prominent in the 1920s and '30s, when
movie stars and mobsters came to gamble and governors built summer
homes. Today? It's got a lot of fancy condo resorts, championship golf
courses and upscale shops. The thing is, so do Hilton Head, Naples,
Scottsdale and other such enclaves.</p>
<p>Yet Schultz calls Brainerd &quot;a classic Minnesota vacation area&quot; and
trots out the usual suspects - Grand View Lodge, Madden's - resorts
that she says have &quot;kept up to date with amenities like designer golf
and full-service spas.&quot;</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/brainerd-minnesota-summer/">The buzz on
Brainerd</a>.</p>
<p>So is it classic or is it &quot;up to date&quot;? For classic, look farther
north, to the Itasca-Park Rapids-Bemidji area (see below).</p>
<p><em>The North Shore</em> : Now she's talking. We love our craggy shoreline on
Lake Superior. I've never thought of it as &quot;home to sweet waterfront
villages and 10 of Minnesota's finest state parks&quot; — for one thing,
there are only eight state parks along the North Shore, and &quot;Caribou
Falls&quot; isn't one of them.</p>
<p>But is it a good place to see before you die? Of course.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/minnesota-north-shore/">Escape to Minnesota's North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p><em>Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness</em> : This 1.1 million-acre
wilderness along Minnesota's border with Canada was the only Minnesota
entry in Schultz's original &quot;1,000 Places to See Before You Die,&quot; and
it's hard to think of a better one.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boundary-waters-tips/">Minnesota's Boundary
Waters</a>.</p>
<p><em>Gunflint Trail &amp; Superior National Forest</em> : Here's a third entry from
Minnesota's Arrowhead region, with a focus on the two best-known and
most expensive Gunflint Trail resorts and the Superior Hiking Trail.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/gunflint-trail/">Adventure on the Gunflint
Trail</a>.</p>
<p><em>Voyageurs National Park</em> : Whew, our only national park got a mention.
Good thing, because more people should explore its vast watery
expanses.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/voyageurs-park-boating/">Land of big
water</a>.</p>
<p><em>Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway in Minneapolis</em> : This was an
inspired choice. We take it for granted, but the loop that connects the
Mississippi to Minnehaha Creek, the Chain of Lakes and Wirth Park is a
national treasure.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_geneva_stone_manor.jpg" alt="A speedboat cruises past Lake Geneva's Stone Manor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-minneapolis-grand-rounds/">Biking in
Minneapolis</a>.</p>
<p><em>Guthrie Theater and Walker Art Center</em> : The new Guthrie and the Walker
addition, both designed by cutting-edge architects from Europe, have
made Minneapolis more hip, which New Yorkers seem to appreciate.</p>
<p>For more about the Guthrie area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/minneapolis-riverfront/">On the river in
Minneapolis</a>.</p>
<p><em>St. Croix River Valley</em> : What would Twin Cities weekenders do without
Stillwater, Taylors Falls and . . .  Scandia?  Wild River State Park
gets a shout-out, too.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/taylors-falls-minnesota/">Sightseeing on the St.
Croix</a>.</p>
<p><em>Red Wing &amp; River Bluffs</em> : You can't beat a drive along the Mississippi
River. Wabasha isn't mentioned, but Winona is, along with its new
Minnesota Marine Art Museum and now-gone Julius C. Wilkie Steamboat
Museum.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mississippi-river-views/">Mississippi
panoramas</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/mississippi-valley/">Mississippi River
Valley</a>
stories.</p>
<p><em>Garrison Keillor's &quot;Prairie Home Companion&quot;</em> : Schultz says she feels
Garrison Keillor's nationally broadcast radio show says a lot about
Minnesota. No quibbles there.</p>
<p><em>Winter Carnival:</em> People just love to tell the story about how St. Paul
responded to the New Yorker reporter who called it &quot;another Siberia,
unfit for human habitation.&quot;  It's a good excuse to mention Summit
Avenue, too.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/st-paul-sightseeing/">Whiskey and
cherubs</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/summit-avenue-st-paul/">Street of
dreams</a>.</p>
<h3>Biggest omission</h3>
<p><em>The Mississippi Headwaters and Lake Itasca</em> : People from Mongolia to
Moldova have heard of the Mississippi, if not Minnesota. The big river
starts here, in Minnesota's first and most cherished state park. It's in
the middle of a lake-resort area that, unlike the Brainerd area,
qualifies as &quot;classic.&quot;</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/itasca-park-tips/">The people's
park</a>.</p>
<h3>Should have included</h3>
<p><em>Pipestone, Jeffers Petroglyphs and Blue Mounds</em> <em>State Park</em> : Plains
Indians come from many states to quarry the sacred soft rock at
Pipestone National Monument. And dramatic formations of marble-like red
quartzite erupt out of the prairie sod here, at the ancient Jeffers
Petroglyphs and at Blue Mounds State Park.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/pipestone-quarries-minnesota/">Pipestone

Coteau</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/pipestone-road-trip/">Road
trip: Southwest
Minnesota</a>.</p>
<h3>WISCONSIN</h3>
<p><em>Circus World Museum</em> : In summer, circus performers come from all over
the world to perform and live on the riverside site of the old
Ringlingville, the wintering grounds of the Ringling Brothers. It's the
Big Top much as it was in the golden days of the circus, and it's
charming.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/circus-world-baraboo/">Baraboo's gilt
complex</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_wisconsin_river.jpg" alt="Lower Dells on the Wisconsin River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Wisconsin Dells, the Wisconsin River is lined with sandstone
formations and bluffs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Lake Geneva</em> : This is in Chicago's back yard, so there's a lot of
money on display. The masses can look on from the 21-mile Shore Path.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/walking-lake-geneva/">Gawking in Lake
Geneva</a>.</p>
<p><em>Apostle Islands</em> : This 21-island archipelago of the national
lakeshore, with Madeline Island, was in the original &quot;1,000 Places,&quot;
and it is indeed spectacular.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/apostle-islands-kayaking/">Kayaking the
Apostles</a>
and other <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/apostle-islands/">Apostle Islands</a>
stories.</p>
<p><em>Canoe Bay</em> : Big-city folks tend to be very impressed by this
status-conscious resort on a small northwest Wisconsin lake, where a
cottage designed by a Frank Lloyd Wright protege goes for $1,800 per
night for two.</p>
<p>Here's a tip: Instead, stay at the <a href="http://theschwartzhouse.com/Home.html">Bernard Schwartz
House</a> in Two Rivers or the <a href="http://www.sethpeterson.org/">Seth
Peterson Cottage</a> in Mirror Lake State
Park, both designed by Mr. Wright himself. The Schwartz House costs
$295-$350 per night for up to six people — in winter, as little as
$195 — and the Peterson Cottage $225-$275 for four.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/frank-lloyd-wright-sites-wisconsin/">Loving Mr.
Wright</a>.</p>
<p>With the savings, hire a personal chef to prepare the prix-fixe
three-course dinners that cost $75 at Canoe Bay.</p>
<p>At the suggestion of a friend in Chicago, Schultz did stay there once
with a boyfriend. She says she can't remember who paid (free-lance
travel writers rarely pay for their lodgings), but that it was romantic.</p>
<p>Those who do have to pay should remember that a reputation like Canoe
Bay's may reflect marketing prowess and a lot of giveaways to travel
writers, not a high level of warmth and hospitality. If money is an
issue, check TripAdvisor first to get a better idea of whether the
resort is worth your money.</p>
<p><em>Door County</em> : Chicagoans would really be at loose ends in the summer
without this peninsula in Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>Actually, it's lovely, with one side devoted to shopping and dining and
one shore for those of us who prefer hiking, biking, kayaking and
swimming. And there's great theater and music for everyone.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/">Door County
stories</a>.</p>
<p><em>American Birkebeiner</em> : The cross-country ski race between Hayward and
Cable, modeled after the original in Norway, is a real feather in
Wisconsin's cap. It's hard to find a place to stay if you want to watch
it, but by all means, try.</p>
<p><em>American Club</em> : Here's another resort that caters to the wealthy. You
can indulge yourself and it costs a lot. Yawn.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/indulgent-retreats/kohler-wisconsin/">Kohler's
luxuries</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dane County Farmers Market</em> : Schultz says she wanted to include
something that was quintessential Madison. Yep, this is it.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-madison/">Shopping in
Madison</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_harbors_lighthouse_fall.jpg" alt="The Two Harbors lighthouse on Lake Superior." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The working lighthouse in Two Harbors is the last on Minnesota's North
Shore.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Milwaukee Art Museu</em> <em>m</em> : This museum on Lake Michigan was pretty good
even before a Spanish architect added the brise-soleil, a blindingly
white &quot;wing&quot; that closes to screen the sun. Milwaukee is new to being
hip, but it's getting used to it.</p>
<p><em>Milwaukee Festivals</em> : Milwaukee has a great festival grounds on Lake
Michigan, and it's busy all summer. German Fest, Festa Italiana, Polish
Fest — and then there's Summerfest, the world's largest music
festival. In fact, just bring a stein and camp there until September.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/summer-milwaukee/">Party in
Milwaukee</a>.</p>
<p><em>Milwaukee's Beer Heritage</em> : From Blatz, Pabst, Schiltz and many other
breweries, Milwaukee ended up with Miller, Sprecher and Lakefront.
Miller beers are nothing to speak of, but Sprecher, Lakefront and many
brewpubs manage to hold up the Suds City reputation.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/milwaukee-brewery-tours/">Mad about
brew</a>.</p>
<p><em>Cheese Country</em> : Now, this is quintessential Wisconsin. Old World
traditions are alive and thriving in New Glarus, founded by Swiss
weavers; Mineral Point, settled by Cornish miners; and Monroe, a hearty
Swiss town where people still eat Limburger cheese by the brick.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/cheese-country/">Cheese Country
stories</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Driftless Area</em> : Another excellent choice from Schultz's Chicago
friends. This pocket of southwest Wisconsin is named for the glaciers
that slid around it, leaving it without the glacial rubble, or drift,
that covers the rest of the region.</p>
<p>Today's visitors come to visit Amish farms, see round barns, ride on the
Elroy-Sparta State Trail and canoe on the twisting Kickapoo River.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/coulees/">Coulees stories</a>.</p>
<p><em>EAA AirVenture</em> : This annual aviation festival in Oshkosh is a huge
deal, drawing 700,000 to 750,000 people and filling up every hotel room
within a 50- to 60-mile radius. Plan early, very early.</p>
<p><em>The Upper Mississippi Bluffs</em> : Again, Schultz's sources steered her to
the right places. The bluffs north of Prairie du Chien are lovely,
rivaling Germany's Rhine Valley, and she includes the outdoorsy river
town of Trempealeau.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/great-river-road/">Great River Road
stories</a>.</p>
<p><em>Taliesen</em> : The tours of Frank Lloyd Wright's estate in Spring Green,
Schultz writes, are &quot;immensely popular.&quot; If she wants to see popular,
she needs to drive up the hill to House on the Rock.  Wright once
ridiculed builder Alex Jordan; Jordan had the last laugh.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/spring-green/">Drawn to Spring
Green</a>.</p>
<p><em>Wisconsin's North Woods</em> : You can't say much about this area — the
northern third of the state — in five paragraphs, but at least it's in
there.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/northern-lakes/">Northern Lakes
stories</a>.</p>

Hikers from the Gunflint Trail have a view of Watap Lake and the BWCAW.

<p><em>Wisconsin Dells</em> : It's the Waterpark Capital of the World!® Need we
say more?</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/wisconsin-dells/">Wisconsin Dells
stories</a>.</p>
<h3>Biggest omission</h3>
<p><em>Ice Age National Scenic Trail</em> : This 1,000-mile trail, which traces
the southernmost advance of the last glacier, is our Appalachian Trail.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/ice-age-trail/">Tracing the Ice Age
Trail</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/best-hikes-ice-age-trail/">Greatest hits of the Ice
Age</a>.</p>
<h3>Should have included</h3>
<p><em>Wisconsin's folk-art sculpture gardens</em> : No other state has anything
like Fred Smith's Wisconsin Concrete Park in Phillips, the Paul and
Matilda Wegner Grotto near Sparta, the James Tellen Woodland Sculpture
Garden near Sheboygan, Prairie Moon Sculpture Garden and Museum near
Fountain City and Nick Engelbert's Grandview between Mineral Point and
New Glarus, all restored by the Kohler Foundation.</p>
<p>Let's throw in the Dickeyville Grotto, too.</p>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/Wisconsin-folk-art/">Road trip: Wisconsin's concrete
art</a>.</p>
<p><em>The International Crane Foundation</em> : This refuge near Baraboo is the
only place in the world where you can see at least one, usually two, of
every kind of crane.</p>
