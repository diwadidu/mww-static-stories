<p>Wouldn't it be great to spend a year enjoying yourself in the 12 best
possible places?</p>
<p>Broadcast journalist Charles Kuralt once gave himself that dream
assignment: Spend one month apiece in your favorite places in the United
States, &quot;at just the right time of the year.&quot;</p>
<p>He devoted July to Ely, the northern-Minnesota gateway to the Boundary
Waters Canoe Wilderness Area.</p>
<p>I could spend all 12 months right here, in the western Great Lakes. Here
are the places I'd pick.</p>
<p>A person could even do them on weekends: It's a bucket list you could
polish off in a year.</p>

<h3>January/A <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/minnesota-ski-lodges-wisconsin/">northwoods ski resort</a></h3>
<p>There's nothing more beautiful than the north woods in winter, when the
forest is a cathedral of snow, spruce and sky.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/cross-country-skiing-basics/">Cross-country
skiing</a>
at this time of year can be a religious experience; the solitude and the
stark beauty of the winter landscape seem to induce contemplation and
lofty thoughts.</p>
<p>Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan are honeycombed with beautiful trails.
I'd choose the ones at
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/maplelag-ski-resort/">Maplelag</a>, a one-of-a-kind ski resort in northwest Minnesota that is as beloved
for its warmth and hospitality as for its well-groomed trails.</p>
<p>If I still had young children, though, I'd go to
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/afterglow-ski-resort-wisconsin/">Afterglow</a> in
northeast Wisconsin, a family resort where guests get towed up a tubing
hill by snowmobile. There's great snowshoeing, too.</p>
<p>If snow is scarce — unlikely at these two resorts - head for
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-skiing-porcupines-michigan/">Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State
Park</a></strong>
on Michigan's Upper Peninsula or the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/nordic-skiing-ironwood/"><strong>Ironwood</strong>
area</a>, which also has four of the region's many <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/ski-alpine-minnesota-wisconsin/">alpine-ski
resorts</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/maplelag_torsten.jpg" alt="A cross-country skier at Maplelag." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A skier heads onto the trails around Maplelag in northwest Minnesota.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>February/ <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/madison-with-kids/">Madison</a></h3>
<p>Nowhere in the region is there so much to do within two blocks.</p>
<p>Visit the Wisconsin Historical Museum and the Veterans Museum. Take a
free guided tour of the Capitol. Take your kids to the Children's
Museum. Eat at some of state's <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/dining-madison-wisconsin/">best
restaurants</a>. Play in the snow during <a href="http://www.winter-fest.com/">Winter Festival</a>
on President's Day weekend.</p>
<p>And that's just Capitol Square.</p>
<p>Walk a block down State Street and you'll be at the Overture Center for
the Arts, which has seven performing spaces and hosts international
artists and Broadway shows as well as the local symphony, opera, theater
and dance troupes.</p>
<p>The Museum of Contemporary Art is next door. For a vibrant mix of <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-madison/">shops
and
eateries</a>,
just keep walking down State Street.</p>
<p>And as a bonus, in February hotels drop their rates during <a href="http://www.visitmadison.com/accommodations/madison-hotel-week/">Hotel
Week</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>March/ <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/gunflint-trail-winter/">Gunflint Trail</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/ice-caves-apostles/">Apostles ice caves</a></h3>
<p>When dirty slush clogs the rest of the region, the <strong>Gunflint Trail</strong>
through the northeast tip of Minnesota
still has a sparkling layer of fresh snow.</p>
<p>Ski on 200 kilometers of groomed nordic trails, snowshoe, go on sleigh
rides, try skijoring, howl for wolves or mush a dog team.</p>
<p>Some years, the skiing is fantastic all the way to April Fool's Day and
beyond.</p>
<p>The other great thing to do in early March is hike or snowshoe along the
shore of Lake Superior to the ice caves on the Apostle Islands National
Lakeshore, near Cornucopia, Wis.</p>
<p>Around the peninsula,
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/bayfield-winter/">Bayfield</a></strong>
holds its <a href="http://www.bayfieldwinterfestival.com/">Winter Festival</a> the
first weekend in March, with a run to Madeline Island and a polar
plunge, candlelight walk, obstacle course and ice golfing.</p>
<p>In the best years, the ice along the shore allows access for a month or
more, from February to mid-March. In the worst years, it doesn't freeze
at all.</p>

Rocky bluffs surround Devil's Lake, one of the clearest in Wisconsin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>April/ <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/">Mississippi River Valley</a></h3>
<p>In late April, everything starts along the Mississippi River. Pelicans
and warblers follow the river north.
<a href="https://admin.midwestweekend.com/plan_a_trip/nature/wildflowers/wildflowers_bluff_country.html">Wildflowers</a>
bloom on sunny hillsides and open goat prairies. The first morel
mushrooms pop up through old leaves.</p>
<p>It's a good time to visit
<strong><a href="https://admin.midwestweekend.com/plan_a_trip/shopping_eating/shopping_towns/galena_getaway.html">Galena</a>, Ill.</strong> , the appealingly preserved 1850s
boom town that groans under a crush of tourists in summer and fall.</p>
<p>At its cousin across the river,
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/dubuque-iowa-sightseeing/">Dubuque</a></strong> , be sure to
stop by the National Mississippi River Museum.</p>
<p>In
<strong><a href="https://admin.midwestweekend.com/plan_a_trip/outdoors_recreation/outdoors_towns/trempealeau_trails.html">Trempealeau</a>, Wis.</strong> , check out the early wildflowers
on Brady's Bluff and ride the Great River State Trail through wildlife
refuges and along sloughs and wetlands. Hike on the McGilvray Seven
Bridges Trail.</p>
<p>April also is good time to visit state parks and take in some
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mississippi-river-views/">magnificent
views</a>.</p>
<p>The best are at Pikes Peak State Park near the northeast Iowa town of
<a href="https://admin.midwestweekend.com/plan_a_trip/touring/mississippi_river/mcgregor_iowa.html">McGregor</a>
; Perrot State Park in Trempealeau; Wyalusing State Park near <strong><a href="https://admin.midwestweekend.com/plan_a_trip/history_heritage/historic_houses/prairie_du_chien.html">Prairie
du
Chien</a>, Wis.</strong> ; and Great River Bluffs near
<strong><a href="https://admin.midwestweekend.com/plan_a_trip/touring/mississippi_river/winona_minnesota_fun.html">Winona</a>, Minn</strong> .</p>

<h3><strong>May/ <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/twin-cities/">Twin Cities</a></strong></h3>
<p>In the Twin Cities, you can do everything in May that you'd want to do
in summer, even taking a dip in its famous lakes if you're lucky (and
relatively hardy).</p>
<p>In May, you'll also get a glimpse of its quirkily artistic side at two
festivals, the <a href="http://hobt.org/mayday/festival/">May Day parade</a> in
Minneapolis' Powderhorn Park and
<a href="http://nemaa.org/art-a-whirl">Art-A-Whirl</a> in the northeast Minneapolis
art district, which also holds the densest concentration of nearly 30
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/breweries-twin-cities/">craft
breweries</a>.</p>
<p>Check out a Nice Ride bike and go on a <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/mississippi-river-bicycling-twin-cities/">history tour from Fort Snelling
to downtown St.
Paul</a>, or gawk at the mansions along <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/summit-avenue-st-paul/">Summit
Avenue</a>, one of the best-preserved Victorian streets in the nation.</p>
<p>In Minneapolis, ride the <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/2243/maps">trails that circle Minneapolis' Chain of
Lakes</a>, stopping at
the <a href="https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/gardens__bird_sanctuaries/eloise_butler_wildflower_garden_and_bird_sanctuary/">Eloise Butler Wildflower
Garden</a>
in Wirth Park to see a vast array of spring wildflowers. On Lake
Harriet, free daily concerts start Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p>Along the <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/minneapolis-riverfront/">Mississippi
riverfront</a>, browse and eat at the Mill City Farmers Market next to the Guthrie
Theatre. Take in the view from the Stone Arch Bridge.</p>
<p>Follow the river south, and you'll come to the free Weisman Art Museum
on the University of Minnesota campus and, eventually, Minnehaha Park.
In May, its famous waterfall should be thundering.</p>

Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.

<h3>June/ <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/">Lake Michigan</a></h3>
<p>This is a great month to hit the big tourist spots on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-circle-tour/">Circle Tour
of Lake
Michigan</a>,
before the crowds arrive.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/best-sights-mackinac-island/">Mackinac
Island</a> is
most gorgeous in mid-June, when its lilacs and yellow moccasins are
blooming.</p>
<p>From there, head down Lake Michigan to <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/sleeping-bear-dunes/">Sleeping Bear Dunes National
Lakeshore</a>, a
35-mile-long stretch of beaches, dunes and trails.</p>
<p>A trip down the Michigan side is one of the best and also cheapest
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-lake-michigan/">beach vacations</a>,
thanks to the many
<a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-lake-michigan/">campsites</a> as well as
<a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/michigan-state-park-cabins/">mini-cabins, camper cabins and
lodges</a> in
Michigan state parks along the lake.</p>
<p>You can do a <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-tour/">half Circle
Tour</a> by taking a
short cut on the S.S. Badger, between Ludington and Manitowoc, or on the
Lake Express high-speed ferry between Muskegon and Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Be sure to allot a couple of days to
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a>. Catch a Brewers game
in Miller Park or one of the big festivals: In June, there's the
<a href="http://lfoa.mam.org/">Lakefront Festival of Art</a> at the winged
Milwaukee Art Museum, <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/polish-fest-milwaukee/">Polish
Fest</a>
and <a href="http://www.summerfest.com/">Summerfest</a>, the world's largest
music festival.</p>

<h3>July/A <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/choosing-lake-resort/">northwoods lake resort</a></h3>
<p>There's nothing more sweet and more fleeting than a July day on a
northwoods lake, from coffee on the dock in early morning to the
midnight rush from sauna to lake, for a float under the shimmering
canopy of stars and northern lights.</p>
<p>Any lake will do. Fishermen like big lakes, such as Minnesota's <em>Leech</em>
or <em>Winnibigoshish</em> or <em>Wisconsin's flowages</em> . Families prefer smaller
lakes with resorts that have sandy beaches.</p>
<p>Charles Kuralt, of course, chose a lake near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-ely-minnesota-summer/">Ely</a> in
Minnesota's <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/canoe-country/">canoe country</a> :
&quot;Anyone who has known the deep woods and the blue lakes, for a week or
a season, puts himself to sleep ever afterward with memories of Ely,&quot;
he wrote.</p>
<p>Traditionally, families spend a week in a small resort with housekeeping
cabins - which is to say, you cook and clean up for yourself. But
there are big luxury resorts, too.</p>
<p>For tips and ideas, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/all-inclusive-resorts-minnesota/">The Minnesota resort of your
dreams</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/best-wisconsin-lake-resorts/">The Wisconsin resort of your
dreams</a>.</p>

<h3>August/ <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/">Lake Superior</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/circle-tour-lake-superior/">Circle Tour of Lake
Superior</a>
is, in my opinion, <em>the</em> best vacation,
and August is the best time to take it. The water on the southern shore
is warm enough to swim in, the black flies are gone and, if you wait
till the last half of the month, the crowds will be gone, too.</p>
<p>In early August, the blueberries are ripe on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/keweenaw/">Keweenaw
Peninsula</a>, and you'll likely see
bears when you're out picking.</p>
<p>You can swim from the lovely beaches on <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/madeline-island-wisconsin/">Madeline
Island</a>
or even from your kayak as you explore the <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/apostle-islands/">Apostle
Islands</a> or the islands off
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/rossport-lighthouse/">Rossport</a>
in Ontario.</p>
<p>You'll see your fill of lighthouses, waterfalls and ore boats, and you
may even see a moose. If seeing a moose is high on your list, take the
ferry to <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/isle-royale-national-park/">Isle Royale National
Park</a>.</p>
<p>For a nine-day itinerary, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/lake-superior-circle-tour-highlights/">Lake Superior's greatest
hits</a>.
For planning tips, see <a href="/plan-circle-tour-lake-superior/">Planning a Circle
Tour</a>.</p>
<p>August also is the best time to visit the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boundary-waters-tips/">Boundary Water Canoe Area
Wilderness</a>,
just inland from the Minnesota's North Shore: The bugs have died back,
and the water is warm enough for swimming.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/r/crow_wing_raft_jumpers.jpg" alt="Kids jump off the raft at a Minnesota lake resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3><strong>September/ <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/door-county-fall/">Door County</a></strong></h3>
<p>This is the month to visit places that are packed during peak months,
such as the <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/wisconsin-dells/">Wisconsin Dells</a>, Minnesota's <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/">North Shore</a> and,
especially, <strong>Door County</strong>.</p>
<p>Door County is the favorite hangout of Chicagoans, but there's a lull
in the action between summer vacation and fall color. Warmth lingers on
the peninsula, wrapped by the waters of Lake Michigan, but hotel prices
drop.</p>
<p>Go paddling in the Mink River Estuary, bicycle on county roads or
Peninsula State Park, tour the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/door-county-lighthouses/">lighthouses</a>, hike in two dozen state natural areas and camp on <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/rock-island-state-park-wisconsin/">Rock Island State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>It's also harvest time, so stop by farm markets for apples and pumpkins
or tour six wineries.</p>
<p>And there are harvest festivals in <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/sturgeon-bay/">Sturgeon
Bay</a></strong> ,
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/baileys-harbor-door-county/">Baileys
Harbor</a></strong>
and <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/fish-creek-door-county/">Fish
Creek</a></strong>
.</p>
<h3>October/Driftless Area</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/a/eagle_harbor_lighthouse2.jpg" alt="Eagle Harbor Light on the Keweenaw." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Eagle Harbor Lighthouse is on the Keweenaw Peninsula.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In October, there's a mad rush to see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/finding-fall-colors/">fall
color</a>, especially
in the forests up north.</p>
<p>After the first weekend, however, the best color is in hardwood forests
farther south. In the third weekend, <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake/">Devil's Lake State
Park</a> near Baraboo,
Wis., glows orange and gold, and Whitewater State Park in southeast
Minnesota  has a palette of russet and ocher into the fourth weekend.</p>
<p>These craggy bluffs and valleys are part of the Driftless Area, a swath
of <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/vernon-county-wisconsin/">southwest
Wisconsin</a>,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadtrips/bluff-country-minnesota-fall/">southeast
Minnesota</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/great-river-road/northeast-Iowa-fall/">northeast Iowa</a>
that the last four glaciers missed as they scraped across the landscape.</p>
<p>The result is a charming hodgepodge of ridges, bluffs and valleys
perhaps best known for its bicycle trails: in southeast Minnesota, the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-root-river-trail/">Root River State
Trail</a>
through
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Lanesboro</a></strong>
, and in southwest Wisconsin, the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/elroy-sparta-bicycle-trail/">Elroy-Sparta State
Trail</a>
and the three other trails in a 101-mile system.</p>
<p>Artists also have taken up residence along the winding roads of bluff
country, and in fall they host <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/art-fairs/midwest-fall-art-tours/">studio
tours</a> that
combine shopping with scenic drives.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.iowaarttour.com/">Northeast Iowa Artists' Studio Tour</a>
is the first weekend, and the <a href="http://fallarttour.com/">Fall Art Tour</a>
through southwest Wisconsin is the third weekend.</p>
<h3>November/ <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/">Minnesota's North Shore</a></h3>
<p>Big, bad Lake Superior is most authentic in November: moody and
dramatic, even violent.</p>
<p>Many people come hoping to catch a <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/north-shore-shipwrecks/">big
storm</a>, like the
one that caught the Edmund Fitzgerald in 1975; its sinking is
commemorated every Nov. 10 at Split Rock Lighthouse.</p>
<p>But if that fails,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">hiking</a> is
wonderful. The bugs and leaf-peepers are long gone, the absence of
leaves opens new vistas and mud has hardened on trails.</p>
<p>Better still, hotel rates drop by up to half. Many people like to rent a
<a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/winter-cabins-minnesota-wisconsin/">cozy cabin or
house</a>
for Thanksgiving weekend, preferably one with a big wood-burning
fireplace and picture windows overlooking the lake.</p>

Shore</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>December/ <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/christmas-chicago/">Chicago</a></strong></h3>
<p>This is a city that really rocks during the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/christmas-chicago/">holidays</a>, especially
since it brought in a traditional Christkindlmarket, an open-air
Christmas market like those in Germany.</p>
<p>It's open every day in Daley Plaza, filling its visitors with Glühwein
and good will.</p>
<p>There's more shopping on the Magnificent Mile, ice-skating in
Millennium Park and the beloved &quot;Christmas Around the World&quot; trees
at the Museum of Science and Industry.</p>
<p>In the evening, see &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; at the Goodman,
&quot;Nutcracker&quot; at the Joffrey and the Apollo Chorus' performances of
Handel's &quot;Messiah.&quot;</p>
<p>The bonus for budget travelers is lower hotel rates; conventions peter
out during the holidays, so hotel rates go way down. For a rock-bottom
rate, go during the week before Christmas.</p>
