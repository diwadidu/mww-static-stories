<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/northfield_archer_house.jpg" alt="The Archer House hotel in Northfield." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
An hour south of the Twin Cities, the college town of Northfield offers
inexpensive but high-caliber concerts and other cultural events.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When it comes to small towns, there really is such a thing as love at
first sight.</p>
<p>In 2000, Joy Gieseke was traveling to Madison from her
economic-development job in Kansas when she stopped for a few hours in
Mineral Point, Wis. She went about her business, but eight months later,
she started looking for a job there, found the chamber position open and
grabbed it.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know why Mineral Point hit me so hard,&quot; Gieseke says. &quot;I
had never heard about it before, but I stumbled across it and couldn't
get it out of my mind. I've stumbled across a lot of little towns and
just thought, well, that was cute.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought I had a special story, but I came here and heard the same
story over and over and over again,&quot; she says. &quot;There seems to be a
quality here that sucks people in.&quot;</p>
<p>There is, and it does. That's why <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/mineral-point-art-tour/">Mineral
Point</a>
gets the top spot on this list.</p>
<p>The village of 2,700 in southwest Wisconsin was a boomtown when
Milwaukee was a few mud streets, and it nearly became the state capital.
After lead mining ended, its glowing limestone buildings remained, and
in 1971, it became the first Wisconsin city listed on the National
Register of Historic Places.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Its residents were heavily involved in historic preservation and the
arts long before anyone had heard the phrase &quot;economic stimulus.&quot;
It's charming but not cloying, cute but not contrived — in other
words, the real deal.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got to get in and feel it for yourself,&quot; Gieseke says.
&quot;Mineral Point isn't for everybody, but I do believe there's
something special here.&quot;</p>
<p>In the bluffs of northeast Iowa,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/decorah-iowa-norwegian-heritage/">Decorah</a>
is amply endowed with the same warmth
and authenticity found in Mineral Point. It has the hipness of a college
town, the down-home friendliness of the country and a Norwegian heritage
that runs deep.</p>
<p>Luckily, its tucked-away location protects it from the hordes - except
the 60,000 who show up every July for Nordic Fest.</p>
<p>Somehow, lovely
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/bayfield-summer-wisconsin/">Bayfield</a>
at the top of Wisconsin has stayed the same down-to-earth village it has
always been, largely due to residents who love it even more than the
tourists and stick with it through thick (summer) and thin (winter).</p>
<p>Many now live in Washburn or elsewhere around the Bayfield Peninsula,
thanks to rising land prices, but Bayfield's gorgeous setting on Lake
Superior guarantees it will always be the main draw.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mineral_point_high_street_pedestrian.jpg" alt="Shops on High Street in Mineral Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Shops and galleries line High Street in historic Mineral Point.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Less than an hour from the Twin Cities,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/">Northfield</a>
gets blanked by the lists, but it's a
great weekend destination. It's got shops, it's got history, it's got
colleges that provide quantities of music, art, theater and lectures to
which admission usually is free; find details on coffee-shop bulletin
boards.</p>
<p>If you're bored in Northfield, you're bored with life.</p>
<p>Considering its assets, <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/sturgeon-bay/">Sturgeon
Bay</a> in Door
County, Wis.</strong>, should be an insufferable tourist town. It has three
darling lighthouses, a beautiful waterfront setting, a downtown full of
interesting shops, excellent places to eat and nearly two dozen B&amp;Bs,
plus it's sandwiched between two gorgeous state parks.</p>
<p>It's actually still a working town; tourists just benefit.</p>
<p>Everybody loves
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/bluff-land/lanesboro-summer-outdoors/">Lanesboro</a>, Minn.</strong>, but that wasn't always the
case. This bluff-country burg had gone into a deep sleep by the 1980s,
when the Root River State Trail was built through town, bringing mobs of
bicyclists with it.</p>
<p>Today, the town is a hub for biking, canoeing and kayaking as well as
fly-fishing and turkey-hunting; people who aren't so outdoorsy can
shop, see plays and go on Amish tours. It's still a little dead in
winter, but the locals need to catch their breath sometime.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Trempealeau</a>, Wis.</strong>, has few of the typical
attractions, because it's just a sleepy hamlet on the Mississippi
River. It exerts a mighty pull, however, on anyone who likes to be
outdoors - looking for wildflowers, hiking up to the river valley's
best view, canoeing on sloughs or bicycling on one of the region's most
scenic trails.</p>
<p>And a meal on the porch of the Trempealeau Hotel, which has a front-seat
view of river traffic, is pretty much the best way to end a day
anywhere.</p>
<p>It costs a lot to fly to Europe but only a tank of gas to get to <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-glarus-wisconsin/">New
Glarus</a>,
Wis. This town near Madison, once almost wholly Swiss, has hung onto its
heritage with a vengeance. It looks a little touristy, with its
half-timbered chalet facades and painted fiberglass cows, but the charm
is more than skin-deep.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_town_view.jpg" alt="A view of Decorah from the bluffs." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In the picturesque bluffs of northeast Iowa, Decorah is a hub of
Norwegian culture.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There are many reasons to visit — but it's worth a stop just to pick
up a bag of pastries from the New Glarus Bakery and an Edel-Pils from
Puempel's Tavern.</p>
<p>Way up in Minnesota's north woods,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-ely-minnesota-summer/">Ely</a>  doesn't get a lot of through traffic. But
those who have been there once come back over and over for the fantastic
skiing, hiking, canoeing and sled-dog mushing. It has always had a bit
of a split personality, having been a mining town long before it was a
gateway to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, and long winters
make it tough to earn a living.</p>
<p>For a long time, <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/grand-marais-minnesota-arts/">Grand
Marais</a>, Minn.</strong>, was a Riviera for the rugged,
a Lake Superior oasis for people who work and play hard in the forests
over the ridge and along the water. It's changing now, as longtime
mom-and-pop motels are replaced with city-style condos.</p>
<p>But we'll still have Artist's Point, the North House Folk School and
the World's Best Donuts. At least, I hope we will.</p>
