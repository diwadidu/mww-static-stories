<h2>You've seen Split Rock and hiked Oberg. What next? Here are 10 great places the crowds tend to overlook.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_superior_entry.jpg" alt="The Superior Entry Lighthouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At the end of the Park Point Trail, hikers see the Superior Entry
Lighthouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The first times I went up to Minnesota's North Shore, I did the same
thing everyone else does: See Gooseberry Falls. Take pictures of Split
Rock Lighthouse. Hike Oberg Mountain.</p>
<p>That's North Shore 101.</p>
<p>Like most tourists, I rushed right through Two Harbors, completely
missing its lighthouse and ore docks. I spent a lot of time watching
boats on Duluth's Canal Park but didn't make it up to Skyline Parkway.</p>
<p>In Grand Marais, I found Joynes' Department Store and Ben Franklin but
didn't explore Artists Point. When I finally did with my young son, he
called it &quot;my idea of the perfect place to play.&quot;</p>
<p>This 150-mile drive, where Lake Superior is rarely out of sight, draws
tourists like a big magnet, especially in fall. Once you've been there,
you want to go back.</p>
<p>We always like to revisit favorites. But if you're ready to move on to
North Shore 202, here are a few places to check out.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Park Point Trail, Duluth</h3>
<p>Most tourists never drive across the Aerial Lift Bridge; if they did,
they'd find a beach house on a wide strip of sand and big recreation
area with a wooden playground that features an ore boat.</p>
<p>The best part is at the end of the road. Park at the airport and keep
going on foot, through a thicket of red pine and sand dunes on Park
Point Trail. You'll see the ruins of an 1855 lighthouse, an abandoned
Coast Guard boathouse and then the long breakwall along the Superior
entry, with a working lighthouse.</p>
<p>If you're lucky, you'll see one of the thousand-footers that frequent
the ore docks. It's four miles round-trip.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/duluth-walks/">Walking in
Duluth</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_amity_creek_shallow.jpg" alt="Seven Bridges Road on Amity Creek." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Stone bridges cross Amity Creek as it flows down to Lake Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Seven Bridges Road, Duluth</h3>
<p>The lure of arriving ore boats keeps most people on Canal Park. But the
views are even more spectacular on Skyline Parkway, 500 feet above Lake
Superior on a natural terrace that once was the beach of Glacial Lake
Duluth.</p>
<p>Seven Bridges Road, which crosses Amity Creek on bridges of basalt and
bluestone, is the place to be on a hot summer day. There are rapids and
swimming holes all along the creek; wade, swim, or watch the cliff
jumpers at The Deeps, near the first bridge.</p>
<p>At the end of Seven Bridges Road, the parkway swings toward Hawk Ridge.
In fall, naturalists staff this open ridge daily, and they'll show
visitors newly banded hawks before letting them fly away.</p>
<p>Get there from Superior Street at 61st Avenue, in Lester Park; turn left
onto Occidental Boulevard, which quickly turns into Seven Bridges Road.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/duluth-skyline-drive/">Duluth's Skyline
Parkway</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/hawk-watching-duluth/">Hawk
heaven</a>.</p>

Ore docks loom behind Lighthouse Point in Two Harbors.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Lighthouse Point, Two Harbors</h3>
<p>In their rush to get farther north, many tourists bypass the real Two
Harbors. But it has the shore's last working lighthouse, an 1892 brick
beacon that glows flame-red in the afternoon sun. It has ore docks, a
long breakwall, an 1896 tugboat, a 1910 depot museum and a 1943
locomotive that is one of the largest in existence.</p>
<p>It also has lovely Lighthouse Point, which is privately owned but so far
undeveloped. Walk under the red wrought-iron arches to the
wildflower-lined Sonju Trail, which winds through a pocket of cedar and
spruce forest.</p>
<p>It's pretty on a sunny day, but magical when wrapped in tendrils of the
fog that often creeps in.</p>
<p>Outcroppings of volcanic rock line its edge; settle in and watch for ore
boats. Then, walk along the breakwall, tour the Edna G. and duck into
the museum, which includes exhibits on John Beargrease and other local
legends.</p>

Harbors</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/o/ionas_beach.jpg" alt="Iona's beach natural area on the North Shore." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Iona's Beach waves sometimes make the flat rocks "sing."
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Iona's Beach near Gooseberry Falls</h3>
<p>This is the most musical beach on the North Shore. It's covered with
flattened pieces of smooth pink rhyolite, and when waves hit the beach,
they fall back into place with the sound of a million bells.</p>
<p>The 10-acre <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/detail.html?id=sna01000">Iona's
Beach</a> is one
of three <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/rules.html">Minnesota scientific and natural
areas</a> on Lake Superior, all
of which should be treated gently (and don't take the rocks). It's
three miles north of Gooseberry Falls at Mile Marker 42; park at the
Twin Points Water Access.</p>

Shore</a>.</p>
<h3>Wreck of the Madeira, Split Rock</h3>
<p>Lake Superior has been called the most dangerous body of water in the
world. It certainly was in November 1905, when a vicious storm damaged
or sank 29 boats.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/o/gold_rock_point.jpg" alt="View of Gold Rock Point in Lake Superior" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The wreck of the Madeira lies at the base of Gold Rock, across from
Split Rock Lighthouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>One of them was the barge
<a href="http://www.mnhs.org/places/nationalregister/shipwrecks/madeira/maddwe.html">Madeira</a>, which winds repeatedly hammered again the base of Gold Rock, across a
cove from present-day Split Rock Lighthouse.</p>
<p>The Madeira was starting to break up when a seaman jumped onto Gold Rock
and scrambled to the top with a coil of rope.</p>
<p>On top, he threw it back to the sinking boat, from which eight of the
nine crewmen were able to climb to safety. How? It's hard to see,
looking at the cliff's sheer, lichen-covered face.</p>
<p>Today, Gold Rock is part of Split Rock State Park. From the top, you can
see the dark outlines of the Madeira, the base of its bow just 40 feet
down and often visited by divers.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/north-shore-shipwrecks/">Gales of
November</a>.</p>
<h3>Sugarloaf Cove near Schroeder</h3>
<p>This spot, once used by a logging company to assemble log rafts, has
gone back to nature and now is one of the loveliest spots on the North
Shore.</p>
<p>A one-mile interpretive trail winds through a red-pine plantation and
alder thicket to a U-shaped cobblestone cove that faces nor'easters
head-on and is a good place to watch waves.</p>
<p>On the opposite point, there's the knob of rock that gave the cove its
name. From there, the trail crosses an old tombolo on a boardwalk and
emerges at the mouth of Sugarloaf Creek.</p>
<p>It's one of the very few beaches where people still can see all the cool
stuff that should be on all North Shore beaches - driftwood, fungus,
animal teeth, bark, logging artifacts.</p>
<p>In the log nature center, interpretive staff give Saturday programs and
also coax the plunder away from light-fingered visitors, so other people
can see it, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sugarloafnorthshore.org">Sugarloaf Cove</a> is six miles west
of Schroeder, at Mile Marker 73.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/c/schroeder_cross.jpg" alt="Father Baraga's cross in Schroeder." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
This cross near Schroeder pays tribute to an extraordinary man.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Father Baraga's Cross in Schroeder</h3>
<p>Once, people had to travel the North Shore by canoe or snowshoe, and
they had to be tough. One of the toughest of all was Father Frederic
Baraga, a Slovenian priest who ministered to Ojibwe settlements between
Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., and Grand Portage, on the opposite end of Lake
Superior.</p>
<p>One day in 1846, Father Baraga, learning of a possible epidemic in Grand
Portage, set out from Madeline Island in the Apostles in a small boat
with an Ojibwe guide.</p>
<p>A terrible storm arose, but they were blown over a sandbar and into the
quiet mouth of the Cross River.</p>
<p>In thanksgiving, they erected a small wooden cross at the site, later
replaced by a granite one.</p>
<p>The Snowshoe Priest's marker is on Cross River at Mile Marker 78.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/r/artists_point_fall.jpg" alt="Fall on Artists' Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The rocks of Artists Point are irresistible year-round.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Artists Point in Grand Marais</h3>
<p>This point of land, a block beyond downtown Grand Marais, is not very
secret. But most tourists just walk out on the breakwall, drawn by the
harbor light.</p>
<p>Instead, turn left at the Coast Guard station and climb down to the
lake-facing beach, where visitors have left artistic pillars and columns
from cobblestones. For children, it's a magnificent playground.</p>
<p>Then walk around the perimeter through a nifty little forest. It's
especially fun in winter, when the wind throws slabs of glistening ice
onto the beach, in as many shapes as a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Four seasons of Grand
Marais</a>.</p>
<h3>Heritage Center in Grand Portage</h3>
<p>At the northeast tip of the state, this re-created fur post on Lake
Superior is one of only two national monuments in Minnesota.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_portage_closeup.jpg" alt="The stockade at Grand Portage." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The stockade at Grand Portage is a re-created fur post.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Grand Portage was a key link in the continent's first multinational
business, a familiar name on the streets of London, where top hats made
from beaver pelts were de rigueur for gentlemen.</p>
<p>At Grand Portage, voyageurs laden with trade goods from Montreal met
voyageurs laden with pelts from the Canadian wilderness. Inside a
palisade, costumed interpreters tell their stories.</p>
<p>In 2007, a <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grpo/planyourvisit/grand-portage-national-monument-heritage-center.htm">heritage
center</a>
first promised in 1958 finally opened, enabling the park service to
display artifacts found over the years and to better tell the story of
the Ojibwe, who made the fur trade possible and whose land surrounds the
monument. It includes interactive exhibits and galleries.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/visiting-grand-portage/">Life on the Grand
Portage</a>.</p>
<p>One of the classic pilgrimages on the North Shore is to the nearby
<a href="http://www.grandportage.com/witchtree.php">Little Spirit Tree</a>, a
twisted, 500-year-old red cedar at the tip of Hat Point that is sacred
to the Ojibwe.</p>
<p>Access to the fragile tree now is restricted, but a naturalist from the
Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa leads van trips there on
weekends. For information, call Grand Portage Lodge &amp; Casino at
800-232-1384.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pigeon_river_falls_top.jpg" alt="Top of High Falls on Pigeon River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Ontario side of Pigeon River, hikers can climb to the top of High
Falls.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>High Falls at the U.S.-Canada border</h3>
<p>Since many tourists don't venture farther north than Grand Marais, they
miss 120-foot High Falls in <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/grand_portage/index.html">Grand Portage State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>This thunderous cascade, which crashes into the Pigeon River with a
force that covers onlookers with spray, is the reason voyageurs had to
carry goods and canoes over a difficult 8½-mile detour, or <em>grand
portage</em> .</p>
<p>This is Minnesota's tallest waterfall, though it shares it with Ontario,
on the other side of the river. It's easy to park and walk to the falls.
Be sure to stop by the new visitor center.</p>
<p>For more adventure, cross the border and hike from the Ontario welcome
center, through <a href="https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/pigeonriver">Pigeon River Provincial
Park</a>. It's a little
buggy, but you'll end up standing at the <em>top</em> of the waterfall.</p>
<h3>And so on</h3>
<p>The North Shore doesn't end at the border. The entire town of Thunder
Bay is a secret spot to many people and is well worth getting to know;
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/thunder-bay-summer/">Exploring Thunder
Bay</a>.</p>
