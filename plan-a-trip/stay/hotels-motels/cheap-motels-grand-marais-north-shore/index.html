Grand Marais still has a nice supply of budget motels.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In summer, when the cities start to sizzle, a lot of people suddenly
realize they'd rather be in Grand Marais.</p>
<p>This village on Minnesota's North Shore is awash in Lake Superior's cool
breezes, and it has everything else a tourist could want — restaurants,
shops, galleries, nightlife and scenery.</p>
<p>But it doesn't always have enough room for all of the escapees,
especially on festival weekends.</p>
<p>&quot;I can't believe how many people come in the day before Fisherman's
Picnic and want a room,&quot; says Patty Robinson, who started the Mangy
Moose Motel. &quot;I mean, you gotta be kidding me.&quot;</p>
<p>Standard rooms at the best-known hotels book first and cost most on peak
weekends and even more during festivals. Miss out on those and your
choice may be sleeping in the car or a $450 luxury suite.</p>
<p>Then what do you do? Try one of Grand Marais' many mom-and-pop motels,
which can't afford to advertise much but are the town's best deals if
you don't require luxury.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Most of them are typical 1950s-style motor hotels with parking spaces in
front. Rooms usually have two beds, a TV and a small microwave and
fridge. That's all most people need.</p>
<p>When I was in Grand Marais one May, I paid less than $100 for an
immaculate motel room at Lund's Motel and Cottages, across from the
municipal campground.</p>
<p>It had cable TV, coffeemaker, microwave, fridge and hair dryer, and it
faced not the highway but the woodsy part of the three-acre property on
which Ron Lund's parents started the resort in 1937.</p>
<p>The genial Lund grew up at the resort — &quot;My dad had me crawling under
the cabins as a kid, helping with the plumbing&quot; — and returned to run
it when his parents retired.</p>
<p>&quot;I love the place,&quot; he says. &quot;I wish I could win the lottery, so I
could keep it as it is.&quot;</p>
<p>Across the highway, I toured two cabins at Nelson's Travelers Rest,
which has a woodsy lot from which guests can see Lake Superior. No. 5
was small but cute, with gingham curtains, a floral bedspread and a
kitchenette. The two-bedroom No. 11 was not so cute, but it sleeps up to
four people.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_spruceglen.jpg" alt="Spruceglen Motel in Grand Marais." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Spruceglen is plain but benefits from its proximity to Aspen Lodge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>That Friday night, Nelson's was the only place in town that was full.</p>
<p>&quot;I try to give people a good product for a good price, and we get a lot
of repeat business,&quot; said owner Tom Nelson.</p>
<p>The best deal in Grand Marais may have been the rooms at the Spruceglen,
on the north side of downtown. It looks a little abandoned, and the
paint is peeling from the windowsills, but the rooms are clean and tidy,
and guests get to use the pool and sauna at the next-door Aspen Lodge
and have breakfast there, too.</p>
<p>The cheapest rooms at the Aspen Lodge were $30 more. I toured one on
the lower level; it had the same décor plus a big picture window with a
view of the lake across the street, and it was larger. For many people,
that's worth $30.</p>
<p>The young front-desk clerk of the Aspen Lodge was friendly and helpful.
But she wasn't the owner, and some people look for that.</p>
<p>&quot;It's amazing how many people say they stay because they like the
mom-and-pop motels,&quot; says Patty Robinson.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Here are some to consider around Grand Marais.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Mom-and-pop motels of Grand Marais</h3>
<p><em>When to go</em> : May and early June are a great time to go. Weather often
is great, but summer rates don't kick in until the second or three week
of June. Reserve at least several months in advance for Fisherman's
Picnic.</p>
<p>On holiday and festival weekends, rates at most places go up $10 to
$50 per night.</p>
<p>For more about town, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Four seasons of Grand
Marais</a>.</p>
<p><em>How to choose</em> : Every cottage and even room is different, so don't be
afraid to ask to see one. Look to see if it's clean and the bed looks
firm.</p>
<p><em>How to get a deal</em> : Don't forget to ask if you can get an AAA
discount. And if business is slow, many motel proprietors will give you
an extra-good rate.</p>
<p>The Grand Marais Hotel Company, which operates the Spruceglen and Aspen
Lodge as well as the Super 8, Shoreline Inn and Cobblestone Cove, offers
past guests a Quiet Time Coupon that lowers midweek and slow-season
rates.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_ron_lund.jpg" alt="Motel proprietor Ron Lund in Grand Marais" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Ron Lund grew up in the motel business and now runs Lund's Motel and
Cottages.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="http://lundsmotel.biz/index2.html">Lund's Motel &amp; Cottages</a></strong> : This
resort is just south of town, across from the municipal campground and a
short walk from the North House Folk School and downtown.</p>
<p>Motel rooms are basic but as nice as they come. I like No. 105, which
has a big juniper bush in front of its window so is a little more
private. No. 106 is at the end, farthest from the highway.</p>
<p>The cabins are back from the highway on the tree-shaded property and are
just as tidy, with somewhat stodgy decor. There's a fire pit guests can
use.</p>
<p>Off-season rates are $10 to $30 lower, and Lund may shave off even
more if business is slow. Call Ron Lund at 218-387-2155.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.travelersrest.com">Nelson's Traveler's Rest</a>. This cottage
resort is on the highway south of town, with views of the lake across
the trees and access via path. There's a fire pit and small play area.</p>
<p>It has nine cabins, each different, and a newer two-bedroom house.
Cabins No. 5 and 6 are smallest but have kitchenettes. No. 6-7 have
kitchens and wood-burning fireplaces.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>A two-bedroom cabin with kitchen and deck has a wood-burning fireplace.</p>
<p>It also has two motel rooms with two double beds, microwave, fridge and
deck. Call Tom and Patty Nelson at 800-249-1285 or 218-387-1464.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mangymoosemotel.com/">Mangy Moose Motel</a></strong> . This small
motel is right downtown, close to the action. Rooms are compact, with an
attractive knotty-pine décor, fridge, microwave and TV mounted on the
wall.</p>
<p>Dogs are allowed in one room. Call 800-796-2975 or 218-387-2975.</p>
<p>And the name? Its original owners ate at a very popular restaurant in
the Black Hills called the Mangy Moose, then read about a popular resort
in Utah with the same name, and figured the name must be a good one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.visitcookcounty.com/lodging/timberlunds-resort/"><strong>Timberlund's
Resort</strong></a>.
This clifftop resort south of town is run by Ron Lund's brother Robert
and was built by their uncle Einar Allen in 1936.</p>
<p>The five red-painted log cabins occupy a rock outcropping and have
spectacular views of Lake Superior from their roomy decks.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_timberlunds.jpg" alt="Timberlund's cottage in Grand Marais." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the south edge of town, Timberlund's cottages have a sweeping view
of Lake Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I loved No. 4, where the sink/kitchen counter, dining table and beds in
both bedrooms all great lake views and breezes. No air conditioner
needed here!</p>
<p>Décor is appealing authentic, with old snowshoes on the pine-paneled
walls, hardwood floor, log bed frames and quilts.</p>
<p>Availability may be limited. Call 218-387-1147.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stayattrailside.com/">Trailside Cabins and Motel</a> : This
motel is on the south edge of town near Nelson's Travelers Rest, and it
has cabins as well as rooms.</p>
<p>Pets are allowed. Call 218-387-1550 or 800-585-2792.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hungryhippiefarm.com/"><strong>Hungry Hippie Hostel</strong></a> : Ten miles
east of town and up County Road 14, not far off the Superior Hiking
Trail, this family-run business in a renovated horse barn has
inexpensive bunks and private rooms with shared bath.</p>
<p>It also has a small tent campground that includes Glamping Tents on
wooden platforms</p>
<p><a href="https://gmhotel.net/index.php"><strong>Grand Marais Hotel Co.</strong></a> : It's not
a mom-and-pop, but this group does offer budget choices, including the
<a href="https://gmhotel.net/properties/spruceglen-inn">Spruceglen Inn</a> on the
north edge of downtown. If you're just looking for a place to stay
that's near everything, it's a good deal.</p>
<p>It's pet-friendly, and three of the 12 rooms are smoking. Ask for one
of the rooms in the back, which face the woods, not the highway.</p>
<p>Rooms have microwaves and fridges, and guests get a free breakfast at
the Aspen Lodge next door and use of its pool and sauna. In addition to
the Aspen Lodge, the group manages the Aspen Inn and the Shoreline Inn.</p>
