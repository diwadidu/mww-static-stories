<h2>In central Iowa, a gorgeous Arts &amp; Crafts boutique hotel welcomes guests.</h2>

The gleam of the Hotel Pattee comes from mahogany paneling, leather
furnishings, original oil paintings and Arts and Crafts accents.

<p>In 1997, a small-town damsel who married a prince — well, an heir —
waved a silver wand over her hometown of Perry, Iowa, and unusual things
began to happen.</p>
<p>She took the dowdy Hotel Pattee, built in 1913 and on the brink of
demolition, and filled it with terra-cotta tile, Persian rugs and so
much Honduran mahogany she cornered the market for it.</p>
<p>Artists moved in and painted murals and whimsical folk-art lamps,
bedsteads and armoires.</p>
<p>Decorators went to work on the Arts and Crafts lobby and library, a
railroad dining-car restaurant and 40 theme rooms and suites that honor
everyone from Louis Armstrong to the creator of the &quot;Alley Oop&quot; comic
strip.</p>
<p>It cost a lot of money. In fact, the princess — Roberta Green, the
daughter of a railroad conductor who moved to California and married
savings-and-loan heir Howard Ahmanson — wouldn't say how much after
the first $10 million. Reportedly, it reached $20 million.</p>
<p>But the hotel she built was beautiful, and everyone loved it.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Perry is a farm town of 8,800 whose largest employer is a
hog-slaughtering plant. Des Moines, the closest city, is 40 minutes to
the southeast.</p>
<p>So the hotel struggled. It's now operated by Leisure Hotels &amp; Resorts
of Leawood, Kan., but it still has virtually all its Arts and Crafts
accouterments and theme-room memorabilia.</p>
<p>Perry may not be a tourist destination, but the Hotel Pattee is. Anyone
who walks through the door can see exactly where all that money went.</p>
<p>The mahogany, of course, gleams — as do the soft leather of the Arts
and Crafts chairs, the luminous oils of the Gary Ernest Smith paintings
and the copper-hooded fireplace in the library.</p>
<p>On the curved walls of the restaurant's Challenger room,  a mural
portrays the days when passenger trains rumbled through town.</p>
<p>The Milwaukee Railroad was Perry's main employer for more than a
century, and residents remember those days fondly — no one more than
Roberta Green Ahmanson, whose father was a conductor.</p>

<p>In high school, Roberta Green was a self-described journalism nerd, not
a cheerleader or homecoming queen, but she'd had a happy childhood. So
the rooms of the hotel she built are valentines to people who lived in
the town.</p>
<p>She pays homage to her school's marching band with a room in which the
headboard is made from a xylophone, saxophone and flutes.</p>
<p>The R.M. Harvey Room, named for a Perry man who was a circus agent and
owner, has a bed with a circus tent for a canopy.</p>
<p>The Earl and Virginia Green Suite has a window seat, green plaid tile
around its wood-burning fireplace and a stenciled quote from Earl Green,
Ahmanson's father: &quot;You can do anything you put your mind to.&quot;</p>
<p>People who love the Arts and Crafts style can wallow in it with stays in
the Gustav Stickley room or William Morris room.</p>
<p>When I stayed at the hotel, I chose the Travel Suite, in which a corps
of folk artists from the Des Moines firm Sticks had gone wild.</p>
<p>Flying hearts, rising suns and quotes in little banners — &quot;Follow the
Highway of Your Heart&quot; — were painted on every surface, including the
window seat, lampshades, footstools, headboard, even the towel bars in
the luxurious bathroom.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Chairs were upholstered in Route 66 fabric, and there was a view of the
outdoor sculpture garden, with its Picassoesque stabiles and tin flowers
bobbing in the wind.</p>
<p>I felt as if I'd landed in an upscale boutique. Looking around, I
decided Ahmanson must have cornered the market on folk art, too.</p>
<p>After a good Iowa dinner of beef filet and garlic mashed potatoes in the
restaurant, I headed downstairs to the wood-paneled bowling alley.</p>
<p>It's named for Ahmanson's bowling grandfather and lined with
reproductions of old advertisements: Olympia Candy Kitchen, the Only
Place in the City for Refreshing Drinks. Mrs. Nina Peck Millinery,
Always Busy.</p>
<p>Soft classical music played as I aimed my balls, helped along by a
computer that offered tips on angles and approach.</p>
<p>In the morning, I had a massage and steam bath in the adjoining spa,
which, with its backlit etched art nouveau glass, looked like a place
Jay Gatsby would like.</p>

<p>After brunch, I went into the ballroom to see the handsome mural &quot;Pride
of Perry,&quot; walking through local history from the Dakota, Fox and Sac
tribes to pioneer and railroading days, when Perry also was known as the
Plowshare Capital of the World.</p>
<p>Louis Armstrong is there, too, blowing his cornet against a full moon.
In 1954, he played a concert in Des Moines but couldn't get a hotel
room there, so he came to Perry to stay at the Hotel Pattee.</p>
<p>And there's a popcorn stand, given by townspeople to a fireman's widow,
who ran it into her 90s.</p>
<p>It's an idyllic view of small-town Americana, like the hotel itself. If
you can get to Perry, Hotel Pattee is well worth a stay.</p>
