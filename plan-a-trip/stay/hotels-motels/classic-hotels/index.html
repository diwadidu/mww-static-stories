<p>Hotel Retlaw in Fond du Lac: Originally opened in 1923 by owner Walter Schroeder (the name Retlaw is his first name spelled backwards) as one of the finest hotels in all of Wisconsin, this neoclassical property is on the National Register of Historic Places. The distinctive red brick fa�ade offers the first hint at the attention to detail that went into every aspect of the original design, with much of that detail preserved in a 2019 restoration that returned the property to its original intent as the city�s first and only luxury hotel. Hotel Retlaw was redeveloped and is currently managed by Legendary Hotels.</p>
<p>From Carla Minsky: Interesting story with Hotel Retlaw � the original owner, Walter Schroeder, also developed other �sister� historic hotels in the region, including: The Schroeder Hotel (now the Hilton Milwaukee), The Astor on the Lake (now The Astor Hotel), Hotel Wisconsin, all in Milwaukee; Hotel Northland in Green Bay; Hotel Loraine (now Loraine Condominiums) in Madison; Hotel Wausau (now the Landmark Building) in Wausau and the Hotel Duluth (now called Greysolon Plaza) in Duluth, MN.</p>
<p>A RETURN TO HOTEL RETLAW FOR FORMER EMPLOYEE CHAD BUROS IS A SIGN OF GOOD THINGS TO COME FOR HISTORIC, HIP DOWNTOWN LANDMARK</p>
<p>FOND DU LAC, Wis. (May 5, 2020) � At a time when positives for the nation�s tourism industry remain paltry due to the pandemic, there is a bright spot for one legendary hotel in Wisconsin, Hotel Retlaw in Fond du Lac. A former employee with a bio that is the envy of travel and tourism professionals in the Midwest has just signed on as director of sales and marketing. Making the news even sweeter is that he is a native son of the community. Chad Buros will oversee leisure, corporate, group and special event efforts at the historic hotel, responsibilities that are his forte given his past tenures in mirror positions at The Osthoff Resort and the Heidel House Resort &amp; Spa, both in Wisconsin, and Hotel Retlaw, then the Ramada Plaza Hotel, with a resume that spans 30 years. For more on the history and restoration of Hotel Retlaw, located on the prominent downtown corner of Main and Division Streets, log on to <a href="http://www.TheHotelRetlaw.com">www.TheHotelRetlaw.com</a>. Reservations are being accepted online and at 833.473.8529.</p>
<p>As the tourism sector remains largely on pause, Buros is taking this time to reacquaint himself with the countless grand features of this 1920s-era property and ramp up for a carefully planned rebound. �We�re looking ahead to that golden moment when travel restrictions ease and we can prove ourselves as the �city hotel� that brings vibrancy to the downtown district,� said Buros. �After the hotel�s remarkable $30 million rehabilitation completed just last year, we�d like to see this grand property take its proper place in the region�s tourism economy.�</p>
<p>Buros, who calls the hotel a �treasure for Wisconsin and the Midwest,� spent nearly seven years at the property in the 1990s, helping lead the Retlaw to a �Ramada Hotel of the Year Award� in 1997. His community ties run deep, as he has lived nearly his entire life in the Fond du Lac area and studied at the University of Wisconsin-Fond du lac. He has served on the meetings and conventions committee of the Wisconsin Governor�s Council on Tourism and the board of the Wisconsin Chapter of Meeting Professionals International.</p>

<p>�I�m looking forward to engaging the community, to showing them how this hotel can be the place they�ll want to frequent for entertainment and dining and special occasions,� shared Buros. �It�s time to reintroduce people to this boutique hotel and I know they�ll be just as amazed as I was.�</p>
<p>Businesses looking for unique meeting spaces for small- to medium-size groups who don�t want to get lost at a large conference center will be among the first customers Buros looks to target. In fact, he�s already building relationships with the major businesses in the area, noting they will be key to midweek room nights and dining reservations. �A strong corporate market for us will make for a strong comeback,� said Buros. His team is also busy courting couples who want to host their wedding reception at the �it hotel� for the region, with the Crystal Ballroom the picture-perfect venue. Hotel Retlaw�s on-staff wedding coordinator is busy booking both Fridays and Saturdays well into 2022.</p>
<p>Guests will be treated to a richly appointed spa with saltwater pool, fitness center, salon, outdoor terrace, spacious farm-to-table restaurant, and an espresso caf�. The eight-story hotel has 121 guestrooms and suites, with an interior design that blends Art Deco flair and neoclassical elegance with contemporary luxury. Hotel Retlaw is also pet-friendly. A local membership program has a long list of dining and lodging discounts, invitation-only events and concerts, seminars, and cooking lunches with host chefs, all included in a monthly fee.</p>
<p>Echoing Buros� affinity for all the hotel can be for residents and visitors alike is the developer, Dennis Doucette, principal and partner at Legendary Hotels. �Our goal is to create a community social center, just as the Retlaw was in the 1920s,� said Doucette. �Think of it as a downtown country club with warm, accessible hospitality befitting this historic hotel.�</p>
