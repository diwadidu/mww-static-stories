<h2>Want to visit the Windy City? So does everyone else. Here's how to find a place.</h2>

<p>Chicago is a fun, fun place to be.</p>
<p>It's popular with conventioneers, families, students, girlfriend groups
and couples on a romantic getaway. Everyone wants to join the festive
mobs at Millennium Park, Navy Pier and, at Christmas, the
Christkindlmarket in Daley Plaza.</p>
<p>There are nearly 40,000 hotel rooms downtown, which you'd think would
be enough. Except in summer, when vacationers from around the world
flood in. And whenever there's a big convention or event.</p>
<p>But new hotels have been popping up, adding to an already huge
selection. How to pick one? Here's a guide.</p>
<h3>What to know</h3>
<p>Reserve rooms as early as possible. Rates are pegged to demand, so
they'll be highest during summer and for conventions and festivals.</p>
<p>Before booking airfare, first check the <a href="http://www.choosechicago.com/meeting-professionals/convention-calendar/">convention
calendar</a>
to see if a big convention is in town; if so, rooms will be hard to find
and very expensive.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On holidays and the two weeks before Christmas, you can get great deals
at hotels that count on business travel. You'll also find good rates in
late fall and winter.</p>
<p>In summer, I like to go on Memorial Day and Labor Day weekends, when
there are few conventions and the city is relatively quiet.</p>
<p>On peak weeks in summer, you can save money by staying at a neighborhood
hotel, since most people want to be near the big festivals in Millennium
Park and Grant Park.</p>
<p>When you decide on a location, check out hotel reviews and prices
online. Pick a few hotels, then compare prices on their own websites as
well as online booking sites. Remember, the hotel tax adds 16.4 percent
to the room rate.</p>
<p>Often, newer hotels offer great rates, since they don't yet have a
track record and aren't in guidebooks. They also tend to try harder
than well-established hotels.</p>
<h3>Hotels with rooftop bars</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_music_hotel.jpg" alt="Chicago's Marina City complex." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From the Club Quarters on Wacker, guests have a view of the Chicago
River and Marina City.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's a new hotel opening nearly every month in rejuvenated hotels,
offices, factories and warehouses.</p>
<p>The latest trend is more about where to socialize — on the rooftop —
as it is about where to sleep.</p>
<p>Right on Navy Pier, the <a href="https://sablehotel.com/">Sable Hotel</a> includes
the Offshore, which it calls the world's largest rooftop bar. It has
views of Lake Michigan AND the Chicago skyline.</p>
<p>In River North, the <a href="https://www.godfreyhotelchicago.com/">Godfrey</a> is a
contemporary boutique hotel with a very popular  rooftop lounge that has
a retractable roof, two-level fire pit and video wall.</p>
<p>In the West Loop, the <a href="https://www.sohohousechicago.com/">Soho House</a>
has a rooftop lounge with fireplaces and a 60-foot-long open-air pool.
On Michigan Avenue, the <a href="http://chicagoathletichotel.com">Chicago Athletic Association
Hotel</a> has a rooftop restaurant and
terrace that overlooks Millennium Park and the lake, and
<a href="http://londonhousechicago.com/">LondonHouse</a> overlooks the river at
Wacker and Michigan.</p>
<p>For bigger budgets, <a href="http://www.langhamhotels.com/en/the-langham/chicago/">The
Langham</a> occupies
13 floors of Mies van der Rohe's 1973 IBM skyscraper on the Chicago
River, near the Trump Tower.</p>
<p>Still high-end but not quite as expensive: The <a href="http://www.loewshotels.com/chicago-downtown/">Loews
Chicago</a> tower, two blocks
from Navy Pier, and Richard Branson's <a href="https://virginhotels.com/">Virgin
Hotel</a>, between the river and Loop theater
district.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Budget lodgings</h3>
<p>Quite a few upscale hotels become budget hotels — with rooms for less
than $100 — during slow times, such as the two weeks before Christmas
and deep winter.</p>
<p>The rest of the year, hostels are good options, especially for single
travelers. All have private rooms as well as shared rooms and kitchens
guests can use.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://thefreehand.com/chicago/">Freehand Hotel/Hostel</a>, in a
former 1927 hotel in River North, has a communal kitchen as well as bar,
cafe and activities concierge. It has rather chic private rooms, even a
penthouse, as well as bunks in a shared quad.</p>
<p>In the South Loop, Hostelling International  <a href="http://www.hichicago.org/">family
hostel</a> has a carpeted great room with
foosball, ping-pong and a pool table. Beds start at $32 per night per
person, including breakfast.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.getawayhostel.com/">Chicago Getaway Hostel</a> near
Lincoln Park, you can get a private room with shared bath or share a
quad with three friends, with breakfast included.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.airbnb.com">Airbnb</a> has hundreds of properties in Chicago,
with lodgings in all price ranges.</p>

Chicago</a>.</p>
<h3>Hotels for families</h3>
<p>The big question for families: Pool or no pool? Kids like them, but you
may not get much sightseeing in if your kids just want to play in the
pool.</p>
<p>You'll definitely want a room that includes breakfast or has a
kitchenette. At Grand and State, a short walk to Michigan Avenue, the
<a href="http://www.homewoodsuiteschicago.com">Hilton Homewood Suites</a> has
two-room suites with kitchenettes, a pool and buffet breakfast.</p>
<p>At State and Ohio, the <a href="http://www.embassysuiteschicago.com">Embassy
Suites</a> has a pool and rooms with
mini-fridge and microwave.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www1.hilton.com/en_US/hi/hotel/ORDMDHF-Hilton-Suites-Chicago-Magnificent-Mile-Illinois/index.do">Hilton Suites
Chicago</a>
has a pool and two-room suites with mini-fridge and microwave. It's
near the Oak Street Beach and two blocks from Water Tower Place, with
its eight movie screens and Foodlife.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Closer to Navy Pier, the <a href="http://www.avenuehotelchicago.com">Hampton Inn
Chicago</a> has a 40th-floor outdoor
pool and includes breakfast.</p>
<p>In the Loop, two blocks from Millennium and Maggie Daley parks, the
historic <a href="http://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/illinois/palmer-house-a-hilton-hotel-CHIPHHH/index.html">Palmer House
Hilton</a>, the city's second-largest hotel, has a pool and offers family
packages.</p>
<p>For big families and groups, vacation rentals usually are the best deal.
<a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/VacationRentals-g35805-Reviews-Chicago_Illinois-Vacation_Rentals.html">TripAdvisor</a>
and <a href="http://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/usa/illinois/chicago">VRBO</a>
have hundreds of them, and filters help you find just what you need.</p>
<h3>Hotels for couples</h3>
<p>If you really like the one you're with, stay in one of the small rooms
at the top of the <a href="http://clubquarters.com/chicago/wacker-at-michigan">Club Quarters on
Wacker</a>, in the
1928 art-deco Mather Tower, overlooking the Chicago River just off
Michigan Avenue. You'll have a spectacular view and even a small
kitchenette.</p>
<p>If you have a bit more money to spend, stay at the
<a href="https://www.staypineapple.com/the-loop-chicago">StayPineapple</a> at
Washington and State in the Loop, a block from the Christkindlmarket.
The building was designed by Daniel Burnham of &quot;Make no small plans&quot;
fame, and the rooms are beautifully appointed.</p>
<p>Other good values — which is to say, hotels where rooms occasionally
go below $200 — include the
<a href="http://www.jdvhotels.com/hotels/illinois/chicago-hotels/the-talbott-hotel/">Talbott</a>
off Rush Street near the Gold Coast, the
<a href="http://www.kinziehotel.com/">Kinzie</a> near the river and Michigan Avenue
and the <a href="http://www.silversmithchicagohotel.com/">Silversmith</a>, a block
from Millennium Park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_river_buildings.jpg" alt="Buildings along the Chicago River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Chicago River near Michigan Avenue is lined with hotels.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you're planning to shop on Oak Street and the Magnificent Mile, try
the European-style <a href="http://www.chicagoraffaello.com/">Raffaello</a>, a
block east of Water Tower Place in a quieter neighborhood.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of money to spend, the sky's the limit. Chicago is
full of beautiful and sophisticated hotels — the <a href="http://www.fourseasons.com/chicago/">Four
Seasons</a>, the
<a href="http://chicago.peninsula.com/en/default">Peninsula</a>, the <a href="http://www.waldorfastoriachicagohotel.com/">Waldorf
Astoria</a> — with spas,
trendy restaurants and every amenity and service. Expect to pay $500
and up.</p>
<p>And if you're looking for a more intimate atmosphere, Chicago also has
quite a few <a href="http://chicago-bed-breakfast.com/">bed-and-breakfast inns</a>.</p>
<h3>Hotels in neighborhoods</h3>
<p>It can be nice to get away from the shadows and cold winds that whip
through downtown's skyscraper canyons.</p>
<p>Lincoln Park is a great place to stay, especially if you plan to bike
along the lakefront or visit the beach. Quite a few VRBO and Airbnb
places are there, as well as the <a href="http://www.jdvhotels.com/hotels/illinois/chicago-hotels/hotel-lincoln/">Hotel
Lincoln</a>, across from Lincoln Park and North Avenue Beach.</p>
<p>Farther north along Lincoln Park, the <a href="http://www.innlp.com/wp/">Inn at Lincoln
Park</a> and <a href="http://www.willowshotelchicago.com/">Willows
Hotel</a> are near Diversey Harbor.
The <a href="http://www.majestic-chicago.com/">Majestic</a> and <a href="http://www.hawthorneterrace.com/">Best Western Plus
Hawthorne Terrace</a> are near Belmont
Harbor and not far from Wrigley Field.</p>
<p>You'll still find a lot of great restaurants as well as attractions,
including the Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago History Museum, Second City
comedy club and Kingston Mines blues club.</p>
