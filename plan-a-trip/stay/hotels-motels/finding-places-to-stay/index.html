<h2>If you want a room you can afford, you might need to widen your search. Here's how.</h2>

<p>If you've ever been shocked by the price of a hotel room, join the
club.</p>
<p>You may have barely heard of Duluth, Minnesota, but rooms there will
cost you at least $200 on summer and fall weekends, $350 if you wait
until the last minute. Don't forget to add nearly 14 percent in taxes.</p>
<p>Hotel rooms cost about the same in Chicago, except tax is 16.4 percent.
And in both towns, you'll pay closer to $500 during big events.</p>
<p>These days, you have to be creative if you don't want to spent your
entire vacation budget on one measly weekend away. That's why such
hotel alternatives as Airbnb and VRBO have become so popular.</p>
<p>Here's a guide to finding a room — ideally, one you can afford.</p>
<h3>Hotels</h3>
<p>The best way to get a good deal on a hotel is to reserve far in advance,
before the hotel has a chance to adjust its rates upward due to high
demand.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>To get a sense for what rooms are going for on a certain date, check
<a href="http://www.hotels.com/">Hotels.com</a>, <a href="http://www.orbitz.com/">Orbitz</a>, <a href="https://www.travelocity.com/">Travelocity</a>,
<a href="https://www.hotwire.com/">Hotwire</a> and
<a href="http://www.trivago.com/">Trivago</a>, all owned by Expedia, or
<a href="http://www.booking.com/">Booking.com</a> and
<a href="https://www.kayak.com/">Kayak</a>, both owned by Priceline.
<a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels">TripAdvisor</a> runs hotel rates
alongside user ratings.</p>
<p>When you find a hotel that looks good, check the hotel's own website;
sometimes, a hotel will offer the same price plus perks and upgrades.</p>
<p>If you can't find a price you like, move on to Plan B, as in Airbnb.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb</a></h3>
<p>This home-sharing site was founded in 2007 by three young San Francisco
men who rented an air bed to a desperate conventioneer.</p>
<p>Since then, the site's air beds and spare rooms have been joined by
castles, mansions and yachts, and it now lists millions of properties in
more than 200 countries.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_straz_tower.jpg" alt="The Straz Tower dorm at Marquette University." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Marquette University's Straz Tower provides inexpensive dorm rooms on
the edge of downtown Milwaukee.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But you still can get a room for $60-$75, making it a godsend for poor
students and recent graduates traveling to big cities for interviews or
conferences.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.vrbo.com/">VRBO</a></h3>
<p>If you have a group, these Vacation Rentals By Owner homes, part of the
Homeaway network, are a good bet.</p>
<p>The properties tend to be at least as expensive as hotel rooms, but they
offer a much wider selection of locations.</p>
<p>Properties vary widely. One spring, my husband and I rented the top
floor of a VRBO home in the Oahu beach town of Kailua, where President
Obama and his family vacation, and it was easy as pie.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The owner left the key under the mat and invited us to use beach gear in
the unlocked garage, which we did. We paid a $200 security deposit,
which was promptly refunded after our stay.</p>
<p>That summer, our experience was complete different when renting a
one-bedroom VRBO condo on Chicago's Gold Coast for me, my husband and
his parents.</p>
<p>The owners' list of rules and restrictions was so long and stringent I
felt bullied into buying a $49 &quot;rental insurance&quot; policy. I also
had to send a scan of my driver's license and list every member in my
party and their ages. By the time I had signed all the documents, I
didn't want to stay there anymore.</p>
<p>The brownstone condo had good ratings and a special endorsement from the
&quot;VRBO Bear.&quot; But while it had a fantastic location, the sofa bed
sagged in the middle (as they nearly all do), and there were only three
pillows for four people.</p>
<p>And rental costs tend to balloon with VRBO. With cleaning fee,
insurance, taxes and &quot;weekend rate add,&quot; our $260 nightly rate
became $375.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/a/kailua_room.jpg" alt="VRBO suite in Kailua, Oahu." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
This VRBO studio apartment near the beach in Oahu opens onto a large
deck.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>However, Airbnb charges processing fees, and many of its properties
charge cleaning fees. And increasingly, Airbnb also is collecting city
hotel taxes.</p>
<p>Another drawback with vacation rentals is check-in times. At hotels, you
can leave your bags behind the desk if you arrive early.</p>
<p>Not at vacation rentals whose owners live elsewhere.</p>
<p>At the Chicago condo, it was a big problem that my in-laws were flying
in from Europe at 10:30 a.m., with all their luggage for a three-week
vacation, but we couldn't check in until 3 p.m. Luckily, the condo was
vacant the previous day, and the owner let us check in early.</p>

<h3>Booking.com</h3>
<p>This handy hotel booking site now offers many vacation houses and
apartments, and even some rooms in traditional bed-and-breakfasts.</p>
<h3>Dorms and hostels</h3>
<p>In the summer, many colleges rent out rooms in their residence halls.
Most have a fridge in the room, and access to a kitchen.</p>
<p>One of the best deals is Marquette University's Straz Tower, on the
edge of downtown Milwaukee. If you rent a room there, you get a great
view and can easily save $200 a night over a downtown hotel.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="https://admin.midwestweekend.com/plan_a_trip/stay/dorms_hostels/dorm_lodgings_midwest.html">On budget in a
dorm</a>.</p>
<p>A few cities have hostels, most notably Chicago and Madison. The
Hostelling International hostel in Chicago's South Loop is a great
deal, especially for single travelers.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="https://admin.midwestweekend.com/plan_a_trip/stay/dorms_hostels/hostels_minnesota_wisconsin_chicago.html">At home in a
hostel</a>.</p>
<h3>Staying for free</h3>
<p>Many people enjoy entertaining hosts from around the world and don't
charge.</p>
<p>If you arrive by bicycle, you're welcome to stay with hosts in the
<a href="http://www.warmshowers.org">Warmshowers</a> worldwide network.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org">Couchsurfing</a> is a similar social network,
without the bicycling requirement. If you're adventurous and flexible
and you like to meet people, it's a great way to travel on a budget.</p>
<p><a href="http://servas.org/">Servas International</a> was founded in 1949 to
promote peace through person-to-person contact. Hosts often spend the
entire day with guests, showing them around.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://caretaker.org/">Caretaker Gazette</a> lists house-sitting
opportunities around the world. Often, house-sitters pay utilities.</p>
<p>Many sites help people arrange home exchanges. These can be a great
deal, but unless you've bothered with a contract before you trade,
there's no recourse if your guests damage your home.</p>
