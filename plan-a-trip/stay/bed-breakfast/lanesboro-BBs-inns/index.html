<h2>In this bicycling capital, take your choice of B&amp;Bs, small inns and even cabins.</h2>

The 1892 Scandinavian Inn is one of many B&Bs in Victorian-era homes.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Before the Root River State Trail was built, the only places to stay in
Lanesboro were some small hunters' cabins near the city park.</p>
<p>That was before there was anything to do in the isolated village besides
hunt and fish. Now Lanesboro is the recreational and cultural capital of
southeast Minnesota, with a new theater, an arts center and 60 miles of
paved bicycle trails.</p>
<p>With visitors pouring in, Lanesboro also has become the
bed-and-breakfast capital of the Minnesota, with more B&amp;Bs than any
other town, plus several small inns.</p>
<p>And they're still not enough for everyone who wants to visit on
beautiful weekends in summer and fall.</p>
<p>When I first visited Lanesboro in 1990 and stayed at the Carrolton
Country Inn, it was the only one of the three inns that allowed
children. In 1994, when I stayed with my sister at Mrs. B's, it was the
only place that had a room with two beds.</p>
<p>Now there are lots of choices for everyone — families, friends,
honeymooners, singles.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>All over town, there are innkeepers who couldn't resist the call of
this bluff-country burg.</p>
<p>At the Thompson House, I met Kathy Culbertson, who already was in love
with Lanesboro when she met her husband Robert, who grew up there but
had moved to Wisconsin.</p>
<p>&quot;He thought I was so crazy,&quot; she said. &quot;You know, if you grow up
here, you don't see the attraction.&quot;</p>
<p>But Robert always had admired the 1872 Italianate house across from his
childhood home, so they bought it, restored it and opened it as a
bed-and-breakfast.</p>
<p>I met triathlete Bonnie Handmacher, who first visited Lanesboro in 1990
as part of a bicycling tour group.</p>
<p>&quot;After the bike trip, I was addicted,&quot; Handmacher said. &quot;I'd hop
in my car on the weekends and go — I was living in Chicago then, but
five hours was nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>She'd stay at O'Leary's, and when it went up for sale, she bought it
and got herself transferred to the Twin Cities. She's cut her drive in
half and has her own B&amp;B to stay in on weekends.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanesboro_berwood.jpg" alt="Berwood Hill Inn outside Lanesboro." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Tastes in lodgings are highly personal. The same piles of pillows one
person wants to torch are someone else's decorating coup.</p>
<p>People who like lots of antiques and Victoriana may like the Historic
Scanlan House. People who prefer log cabins can find them at Cedar
Valley Resort along the Root River.</p>
<p>One of the poshest inns, the Berwood Hill, is in a romantic setting
outside town.</p>
<p>In town, the Cottage House Inn and Green Gables are good places to go
with children or friends, since they have rooms with two beds.</p>
<p>They're also especially good values in the off season, along with Stone
Mill Suites, which often offers specials. Several inns offer discounts
to <a href="http://minnesota.publicradio.org/support/member_benefits/">members of Minnesota Public
Radio</a>.</p>
<p>Some inns offer extra privacy, such as the Habberstad House, which has a
carriage house.</p>
<p>With so many places to choose from, staying overnight in Lanesboro is an
adventure. Now, the only challenge is getting a reservation.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Lodgings in Lanesboro</h3>
<p>Most places have two-night minimums on weekends in summer, and some in
winter.</p>
<p>Reserve far in advance for summer and fall weekends. Prices drop steeply
in winter, especially at the small inns; at the B&amp;Bs, you may have to
ask for a deal. Every inn is bicycle-friendly.</p>
