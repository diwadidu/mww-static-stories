<h2>If a stay in an ordinary B&amp;B isn't enough, try one in a silo or on a submarine.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/maplelag_caboose.jpg" alt="A live-in caboose at Maplelag." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Two cabooses are among the lodgings at Maplelag Resort in northwest
Minnesota.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Once, four walls and a little Victorian frippery were all innkeepers
needed to attract guests.</p>
<p>Then, they got creative.</p>
<p>Now, there's an inn room with eight walls, and a room with just one.
There's a room with bars and a steel door. There are rooms on water and
on wheels.</p>
<p>Who wants to stay in these singular digs? Just about everyone.</p>
<p>&quot;They come, I'm telling you,&quot; says Roger Lee. He and his wife,
Jann, added an 1893 caboose to the grounds of their 1903 Queen Anne, the
Whistle Stop Inn in western Minnesota, and it was so popular they went
looking for another one. Instead, they found a 1909 Pullman car and
spent a year renovating it.</p>
<p>&quot;We opened it up, and they stood in line to stay in the darn thing,&quot;
he said. &quot;So we said, gee, we should have another one. So we found
another one 35 miles away from here and spent a year renovating that
one. Now, we're tired.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The second Pullman, a burgundy-painted 1895 car called the Imperial, is
the most popular, Lee says. Like the Palace Car, it has a double
whirlpool, VCR and 750 square feet of space, but also a gas fireplace
and its original stained glass and gleaming woodwork.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a very strong addiction, I guess you could call it, to
trains,&quot; Lee says. &quot;Steam trains, that is - the old diesels are
just not that romantic.&quot;</p>
<p>To many B&amp;B aficionados, romance lies in the past, when valiant
lighthouse keepers toiled in isolation, when grimy firemen shoveled coal
into massive locomotives, when settlers struggled to build a town's
first school or church.</p>
<p>Lighthouses score highest on the romance meter, and they've found new
life as B&amp;Bs all over the continent. On Lake Superior, the 1892 beacon
in Two Harbors became the Lighthouse B&amp;B in 1999 and is tremendously
popular.</p>
<p>It doesn't have the luxuries of some inns, but as the last working
lighthouse on Minnesota's North Shore, it has lots of cachet.</p>
<p>&quot;When I go home, I tell the guests they're the keepers of the light,
and they're in charge,&quot; says Judy Sellman of the Lake County
Historical Society, which owns it and uses profits to pay for
restoration. &quot;A lot of them take it very, very seriously.&quot;</p>

West of Marquette, Mich., Big Bay Point Lighthouse B&B sits on a cliff
overlooking Lake Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Other inns have pasts that are not quite so romantic. At the 1869
JailHouse Inn in Preston, Minn., which served as the Fillmore County
jail for 102 years, one room is in a cellblock, complete with bars and
metal door.</p>
<p>Even with carpeting, wingback chairs and its own video library, with
such titles as &quot;The Rock&quot; and &quot;Escape From Alcatraz,&quot; it's not
a very inviting place, acknowledges proprietor Marc Sather.</p>
<p>Still, it's always been popular with guests, he says - families,
groups of girlfriends and &quot;people of various persuasions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's more of a fun theme room,&quot; he says. &quot;We've had former
prisoners come back; they wanted to look, but they didn't stay.&quot;
Other rooms are named after their previous functions: the Courtroom, the
Detention Room, the Processing Room and the Drunk Tank.</p>
<p>&quot;That's where the drunks were put overnight, and they could let
themselves out the next day, just like Mayberry, U.S.A.,&quot; Sather
says.</p>
<p>Today, guests needn't spend more than a night or two, to get a taste of
the past or just for the novelty. Then, they can go home — or on to
the next era.</p>
