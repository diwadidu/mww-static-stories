In Dubuque's Four Mounds Inn, the Mississippi Suite has a view of the
river.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There are a lot of good views in the world — from observation towers,
skyscrapers, bluff-top parks.</p>
<p>But the best view always is the one you can admire from your own room.</p>
<p>Many places in the Upper Midwest have a lovely window on the world —
cabins on lakes, hotels on rivers, B&amp;Bs in the bluffs. But some rise
above the others, often literally.</p>
<p>I've stayed in a treehouse-like cottage in the bluffs above the
Mississippi and in a lighthouse on the edge of a Lake Superior cliff.</p>
<p>From an art-deco tower, I've looked down on a mile of Chicago River,
and from a Mississippi towboat, I've looked up at a shimmering
cathedral.</p>
<p>Usually, the better the view, the better the story.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Dubuque, Iowa, is built on seven hills, so it's not hard to find a good
view there. But I'd never heard of a place called Four Mounds until I
ran into a woman who spoke with great enthusiasm about her stay in its
Majestic River Suite.</p>
<p>An Arts and Crafts aerie with a sleeping porch overlooking the
Mississippi did sound pretty great, so I reserved the suite for my
birthday weekend and drove along the Mississippi to the bluffs above
Dubuque.</p>
<p>The view was nice, but it was eclipsed by the perfectly preserved
interior of the 1908 mansion, home of a Victorian woman who had a mind
of her own.</p>
<p>&quot;The rumor is that Frank Lloyd Wright came to give Mrs.‭ ‬Burden a
quote,‭ ‬since he did so much work in Spring Green, and he kept saying,‭
'‬Where is the man of the house‭?&quot; — ‬this is‭ ‬1905,&quot; said
manager Marie Fitzgerald. &quot;She said,‭ '‬I'm making the decisions.'‭
So the word is that he left in a huff.&quot;</p>

<p>Viola and George Burden then had Chicago architect Lawrence Buck design
their house, which became the centerpiece of a 60-acre &quot;gentleman's
farm.&quot; In 1982, their daughter-in-law bequeathed it to the city.</p>
<p>Now, it's on the National Register of Historic Places and operates as a
non-profit inn and conference center. In summer, it holds an adventure
day camp for low-income children, and during the school year, it teaches
job skills to at-risk youth.</p>
<p>Hiking trails wind along the wooded bluffs and to a ropes course,
playhouse, rock garden, barn and other outbuildings that guests are free
to explore.</p>
<p>In the gabled Grey House, our suite looked as if it had jumped off the
pages of Arts and Crafts Home magazine. It had a bedroom with a brick
fireplace, leather Mission armchairs, trestle tables and fresh flowers,
and our &quot;sleeping porch&quot; was furnished with a Norway pine, a
spotting scope and windows on three sides.</p>
<p>For the first time, I wanted to take my B&amp;B room home with me.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We were lulled to sleep by trains rumbling at the foot of the bluffs
and owls calling from the trees outside our window. When we woke up, so
many songbirds were calling it sounded like a jungle.</p>
<p>At breakfast, we sat around a big oak table adorned with peonies, and
Fitzgerald served us stuffed French toast, bacon and fresh strawberries
and melon.</p>
<p>All of the rooms at Four Mounds are lovely, and all of the guests have a
view of the Mississippi River Valley from the manicured lawn, which
rolls right to the edge of the bluff. But only the Majestic River Suite
gives its guests a front-row seat.</p>
<p>Here are our favorite rooms with a view.</p>
<h3>Iowa</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.fourmounds.org">Four Mounds Inn</a> in Dubuque</strong>.
On a blufftop estate near Eagle Point
Park, this 1908 inn is a beautiful Arts and Crafts non-profit
bed-and-breakfast inn and conference center.</p>
<p>Go for the Majestic River Suite and its airy sleeping porch unless
you're bringing your family, in which case the Marvin's Gardens cabin
would be very nice.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.thehancockhouse.com/">Hancock House B&amp;B</a>, Dubuque</strong> :
This was one of the most prosperous
towns in the region in the last half of the 19th century, and its
steepled cityscape still is impressive. Among its many mansions is the
Hancock House, an 1891 Queen Anne built by the Midwest's largest
wholesale grocer.</p>
<p>The whole town spreads out beneath the Hancock's wraparound porch, and
eagles circle in winter.</p>
<p>Five rooms have views, including the Doll Room, with its double
whirlpool set into a window-lined turret, and Mr. Hancock's Room, with
its turret, fireplace and original marble bathroom.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hawksview.net">Hawks View Cottages &amp; Lodges</a>, Fountain
City</strong> : Five cottages on a steep hillside
above this Mississippi River village provide a peaceful retreat with an
especially nice view. The Red Tail has the widest view, but the smallest
cottage, Goshawk, has the prettiest deck. Marshhawk is
wheelchair-accessible.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/dubuque_bb_view2.jpg" alt="The Hancock House inn has a spectacular view of Dubuque." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Birds hop around just outside, in the tree branches that brush the many
windows. Skylights splash sun on the gleaming pine interiors.</p>
<p>Each cottage has two stories, a double whirlpool, a full kitchen, one or
two decks and a pull-out sofa on the first floor. Rates include
breakfast supplies and a bottle of wine. There are two lodges in the
adjoining valley, overlooking vineyards.</p>

oddities</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.garmischresort.com">Garmisch USA</a>, Cable</strong> :
This historic resort in northwest
Wisconsin, with its medieval hunting lodge motif, is an eyeful in
itself. Room 7, with its view of Lake Namekagon and wood-burning
fireplace, is my favorite, but Room 6 has an even bigger view, 25 feet
of plate glass from which to watch the sun set over the huge lake.</p>
<p>Room 2 has a smaller view, and the Bavaria Suite has a lower-level view
as well as a two-person whirlpool and a private deck. There's a good
restaurant with many German dishes, and a variety of theme cottages on
the grounds.</p>
<p>The resort has quite a history. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/Wisconsin-historic-lodges/">Classic Wisconsin
lodges</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Straz Tower, Milwaukee</strong> : This is the
budget option for people who want a view. In summer, <a href="http://www.marquette.edu/orl/conference/">Marquette
University</a> rents out dorm
rooms in this 17-story tower, which is on the edge of downtown and has
good access to public transportation.</p>
<p>Ask if you want a room with TV and mini-fridge. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/dorms-hostels/dorm-lodgings-midwest/">Cheap
stays</a>.</p>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://theinnonlakesuperior.com/">Inn on Lake Superior</a>, Duluth</strong> :
All of the lake-facing inns on Canal
Park have good views of the city, the lake and the Lakewalk. But only
the Inn on Lake Superior has patios and balconies, and three corner
rooms that give their occupants views of the lake and Aerial Lift
Bridge.</p>
<p>Room 180 is best for boat-watchers, who can dash out of its patio doors
when the bridge's bell signals approaching boats. Rooms 280 and 380
(which includes a kitchenette) also are good. Check for seasonal
specials.</p>

Minneapolis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.southpierinn.com/">South Pier Inn</a>, Duluth</strong> :
This inn is literally in the shadow of
the Aerial Lift Bridge, across from Canal Park, and guests staying in
the Panoramic Grand Corner Suites have a view both of boats coming in
from the lake and also leaving the harbor.</p>
<p>They're expensive during peak season; to save money, stay there in
spring or late fall.</p>
<p>The one-bedroom Panoramic suites are very handsome, with gas fireplaces
and double whirlpools facing the canal entry. The other waterfront
suites also have balconies, whirlpools and gas fireplaces.</p>
<p>For more about Park Point, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/minnesota-wisconsin-points/">Dunes of
Duluth</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.covingtoninn.com/">Covington Inn</a>, St. Paul</strong> : There are
few sights quite as magical as the Cathedral of St. Paul at night, and
that's just part of the view from this restored 1946 towboat.</p>
<p>Now an elegant inn, it's moored on Harriet Island, across from downtown.
There are four elegant rooms with fireplaces; the Pilot's Quarters has
a rooftop space for entertaining.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.nicolletislandinn.com">Nicollet Island Inn</a>, Minneapolis</strong> :
All of the 24 rooms at this 1893
limestone inn have views — of St. Anthony Main, the river or downtown
Minneapolis. For a treat, ask for a corner room and get two views. Some
rooms include whirlpools. Ask about packages.</p>

<h3>Michigan's Upper Peninsula</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.bigbaylighthouse.com/">Big Bay Lighthouse B&amp;B</a>, Big Bay</strong> :
This lighthouse, 25 miles east of
Marquette on Lake Superior, is on the National Register of Historic
Places and has seven attractive rooms.</p>
<p>Guests can climb to the top of the tower and onto its wraparound
catwalk. There's a sauna, and spa services are available.</p>
<p>In the village of Big Bay, guests can dine at the Thunder Bay Inn, a
vacation retreat for Henry Ford and his executives that was used in the
filming of the 1959 film &quot;Anatomy of a Murder.&quot;</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.thelandmarkinn.com/">The Landmark Inn</a>, Marquette</strong> .
Rooms in this restored 1930 inn have
spectacular views of Lake Superior. For a treat, reserve the two-room,
two-bath Penthouse Suite, which also has a whirlpool, steam shower,
fireplace, living room and kitchen.</p>
<p>The hotel is a member of the National Trust's Historic Hotels of
America program.</p>

<h3>Chicago</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://clubquartershotels.com/chicago/wacker-at-michigan">Club
Quarters</a> on
Wacker</strong> : There are a lot of rooms with a view in Chicago. But I like
rooms in the 1928 art-deco <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mather_Tower">Mather
Tower</a>, whose tiny,
octagonal upper floors create an aerie for guests.</p>
<p>Guests have sweeping views of the Chicago River and the twin beehives of
Marina City, and they're only a block from the Michigan Avenue bridge.
The tower rooms are small — the floors are the smallest of all Chicago
skyscrapers — but they can be a bargain.</p>
<p>Every time I've stayed there, my room has been upgraded to a river view;
if yours isn't, ask.</p>
