<h2>In Duluth, guests at historic inns get a look into Duluth's gilded past.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_cotton_side.jpg" alt="The Cotton Mansion B&B in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Cotton Mansion was owned by the lawyer who helped John D.
Rockefeller turn Duluth into a U.S. Steel town.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In 1890, Duluth was a treasure chest waiting to be opened.</p>
<p>It sat at the foot of Lake Superior, connected to the steel mills and
cities of the East by water. White-pine forests lay to the south and
west, and rich veins of iron ore to the north.</p>
<p>It couldn't fail to make money for the men who came to tap its riches,
and it didn't.</p>
<p>John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan swooped in, made killings and took
the profits back to New York. But other millionaires — in the 1910s,
Duluth had more per capita than any other city in the world — stayed,
building mansions that remain as monuments to a bygone opulence.</p>
<p>Chester Congdon was a moderately successful lawyer when he arrived in
1891. Fifteen years later, he was the second-richest man in Minnesota,
after James J. Hill, and had started building Glensheen, the largest and
grandest house in Duluth.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He wasn't an innovator, but he did have an uncanny ability to turn all
of Duluth's resources — land, timber, ore, shipping — toward his own
gain.</p>
<p>&quot;He speculated ahead of technology,&quot; said Jennifer Carlquist of
Glensheen Historic Estate, now run by the University of Minnesota and
open for tours. &quot;He speculated on things that soon would be in demand.
That was his genius.&quot;</p>
<p>The company where Congdon got his start, Oliver Iron Mining, also
enriched William Olcott, its president, and Joseph Bell Cotton, the
lawyer who helped Rockefeller seize control of the mine, which became
part of U.S. Steel.</p>
<p>Charles Duncan was a lumber baron who brought modern utilities to the
town. George Barnum was a grain shipper who brought steamships into the
harbor, which, by 1907, had replaced New York as the nation's No. 1
port.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_olcott.jpg" alt="Olcott House B&B in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The first owner of the Olcott House, now the Merryweather Inn, owned a
mining company.

<p>And then there were those who provided services as the city swelled in
the 1880s and '90s, such as Ellery Holliday, who sold real estate.</p>
<p>They all built homes that, in the days before the stock market,
represented a large portion of their fortune. For sites, most chose
hillsides in the Congdon Park neighborhood, just up from Superior Street, often on one-way streets that end in wild, tree-lined ravines.</p>
<p>After the tycoons died, many of the homes deteriorated, and some of the
largest ones were chopped into apartments or used as institutions. But
starting in the 1980s, many were returned to their former glory, sometimes
as inns.</p>
<p>This house renaissance coincided with the renaissance of Duluth, which,
by the 1970s, had sunk into shabbiness. It acquired new luster with the
rejuvenation of the lakefront in the early 1990s, and people began to
see it with new eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd been coming through town twice a year on our way to the BWCA,&quot;
said Alan Fink, who then lived in Chicago.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Back then, Duluth was a place to get through. But Duluth kept getting
nicer and nicer, and pretty soon it became a place to get to.&quot;</p>
<p>Eventually, he and his wife, Kathy, bought the Mathew S. Burrows Inn,
which they ran for many years.</p>
<p>Ken Aparicio was smoking a cigar on the porch of the Olcott House inn, where
he and his wife, Kim, were spending his birthday, when he looked across
the street and saw a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign at the 1908 Cotton Mansion, the
largest home in Duluth after Glensheen.</p>
<p>He and Kim, who ran hair-care salons in the Twin Cities, already had
decided to switch their lifestyle for a less-stressful one.</p>
<p>&quot;We thought, 'What do we do well?' &quot; said Kim Aparicio. &quot;And we
thought, 'Wow, we vacation really well.' &quot;</p>
<p>So the idea of living in a millionaire's mansion, and providing a
millionaire's lifestyle to people who needed a break, appealed to them.
They bought the Cotton Mansion and restored it.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_thomson_house.jpg" alt="The Thomson House in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 1909 Thomson House, once an inn but now private, was built by a grain broker.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Today, Duluth's inns are filled with double whirlpools, sound systems
and other luxuries unknown even to the original millionaires.</p>
<p>If you can afford it, take the opportunity to look into Duluth's gilded
past — and present.</p>
<p>And if you'd just like to do some sightseeing, drive along First, Second, Third and Fourth streets between North 21st Avenue East and Tischer Creek, which flows down the hillside to Glensheen. Hawthorne Road, which follows Tischer Creek, is lined with some of the most spectacular estates, many of them Tudor style.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Duluth's grand inns</h3>
<p>Reserve rooms early for summer and for fall weekends. Rates are highest
then; you can save quite a bit by coming midweek from late October
through mid-May.</p>
