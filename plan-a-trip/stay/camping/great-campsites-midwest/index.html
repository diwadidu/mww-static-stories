<p>There's nothing like finding the perfect campsite.</p>
<p>I look for them wherever I go, and when I was at Northern
Highland-American Legion State Forest, one of the most popular
campgrounds in Wisconsin, I found it: Campsite 435.</p>
<p>It's framed but not enclosed by trees, has a lovely view of Crystal
Lake and is on the edge of its sand beach. It's near the shower house
and not too close to latrines, easy to reach but not heavily trafficked
and off a paved bicycle trail to nearby towns.</p>
<p>A family from Rhinelander had reserved it for an August weekend, less
than two weeks before they arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;This is our first family camping trip,&quot; said Cora Eckrich. &quot;We got
here and I thought, 'Really? This is awesome.' Now I think we're
going to be spoiled — is it ever going to be as good as this one?&quot;</p>
<p>Prime spots in state parks often are snapped up as soon as reservations
open, 11 months in advance in Wisconsin and a year in Minnesota. But
plans change, and sometimes you can land a great campsite through luck.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;I'm guessing somebody canceled,&quot; Eckrich said. &quot;The guy next door
said his wife did the same thing.&quot;</p>
<p>At county or city campgrounds, you often can just walk in. That's what
I did on the Thursday night before my weekend at Northern Highland near
Minocqua.</p>
<p>I got to Lac du Flambeau just in time for the weekly powwow, so it was
nearly 8 p.m. when I got to the tribal campground on a beautiful
peninsula in Flambeau Lake. I set up my tent right on the shore and paid
my $18 in the morning.</p>
<p>These days, I'm camping more than I used to. It's to save money, of
course, but I also like being able to travel without reservations. And I
like being outside but close to restaurants and grocery stores as well
as lakes, rivers and bicycle trails.</p>
<p>Here are 30 campsites that made me say, &quot;Wow, this is really
choice.&quot; If you can't get one of them, look nearby for sites as or
nearly as good.</p>

<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/StateForests/nhal/">Northern Highland-American Legion State
Forest</a> between Minocqua
and Boulder Junction</strong> . This vast forest
between two popular resort towns has 21 campgrounds. Crystal Lake, one
of four modern campgrounds, is very popular.</p>
<p>It's not far from U.S. 51, and the lake is ringed by sand beach. From
the campground, paved bicycle trails head north to Boulder Junction and
east to Sayner. I liked shady 435 and also 449, near the pier.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/minocqua-wisconsin-lake-vacation/">Summer in
Minocqua</a>

Junction</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://lacduflambeauchamber.com/directory/listing/lac-du-flambeau-tribal-campground-marina">Tribal
Campground</a>
in Lac du Flambeau</strong> . This low-key campground is on a peninsula that's
on a 10-lake chain, across from the fish hatchery and walking distance
to the grocery store in town.</p>
<p>Tent sites are mixed with RV sites, though tent campers also can choose
grassy spots next to the lake. There are docks, a swimming area and a
nice bathhouse. Call 715-588-4211.</p>
<p>For more about Lac du Flambeau, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/lac-du-flambeau-ojibwe-culture/">Carrying the
torch</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/peninsula/">Peninsula State Park</a>
between Fish Creek and Ephraim</strong> . This is
the most popular campground in Wisconsin. Why? Because this Door County
park is like a little resort.</p>
<p>There's a golf course, an amphitheater where campers can see musicals
by the professional American Folklore Theatre, a lighthouse to tour, a
sand beach, boat and bike rentals and paved trails to ride to nearby
shops and restaurants.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>If you want to be on the beach, try for a site in North Nicolet Bay or
South Nicolet Bay, which has 25 first-come, first-served sites.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.wagontrailcampground.com/">Wagon Trail Campground</a> near
Ellison Bay in Door County</strong> . This
well-tended private campground is a short walk from Rowleys Bay on the
Lake Michigan side of Door County, close to excellent paddling,
swimming, hiking and even zip-lining.</p>
<p>I liked the cedar-lined campsites in the 400s, closest to the lodge and
between the two bathhouses. But in the busy season, I might pick the
most secluded tent-only sites, 111-113, or tent sites 101-110, next to
the six yurts. There are beautiful camper cabins, too.</p>
<p>Nature-loving owners Cheri Ault and Dick Bartlett make sure guests know
about the quiet policy. There's also a store, playground and playing
field.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ironcountyforest.org/saxon-harbor.html">Saxon Harbor County
Park</a> on Lake
Superior near Ashland</strong> . I found this Iron County park while seeking
out nearby Superior Falls, on the Montreal River between Wisconsin and
Michigan.</p>
<p>It has everything anyone wants in summer — a sand beach for swimming,
showers, a protected bay for kayaking and a bar that serves burgers and
pizza on days when it's too hot to cook.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/a/namekagon_camping.jpg" alt="A group campsite on the Namekagon River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near the confluence of the Namekagon with the St. Croix, group campsite
N3.5 is a welcome sight for paddlers.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/camping.htm">Apostle Islands National
Lakeshore</a> near
Bayfield</strong> . The really great campsites are
on the islands, which are accessible only by launch, kayak or sailboat.
But there's one hike-in tent site on the mainland — <a href="http://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/mainland-campsite.htm">Site
1</a> — and
if you like privacy and lake views, it's a prize.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/newport/">Newport State Park</a> near
Ellison Bay in Door County</strong> . Hiking along
Europe Bay on a warm day in August, I saw a tent pitched just off the
trail, on the sandy edge of Lake Michigan. It was Backpack Site 16 —
not luxurious, not convenient, but oh, so well-located.</p>
<p>With Backpack Site 14, it's between Europe Lake and Lake Michigan —
perfect for water-lovers. As at all Wisconsin state-park sites, sites
can be <a href="https://wisconsin.goingtocamp.com/home">reserved</a> up to 11
months in advance.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/door-county-outdoors/">Outdoors in Door
County</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/rockisland/">Rock Island State Park</a>
at the tip of Door County</strong> . It's a pain
to get to this park —you have to take a ferry to Washington Island,
then Rock Island — and you have to bring everything you need, because
there's nowhere to buy anything.</p>
<p>But . . . there are no ticks and no mosquitoes, and the campgrounds are
on white-sand beach. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/rock-island-state-park-wisconsin/">Wisconsin's Icelandic
outpost</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nps.gov/sacn/index.htm">Namekagon River</a> west of Trego in
northwest Wisconsin</strong> . Late one August
afternoon, our group of increasingly anxious paddlers came upon N3.5,
the last available group campsite before the Namekagon's confluence with
the St. Croix.</p>
<p>It was a haven that, by then, seemed like heaven. It was surrounded by
wildflowers and had everything we needed — a picnic table, a fire
ring, a vault toilet — plus the swift, clear waters of the Namekagon,
where we celebrated with an after-dinner swim.</p>
<p>There are more than 100 primitive
<a href="http://www.nps.gov/sacn/planyourvisit/camping.htm">campsites</a> along the
St. Croix National Scenic Riverway, all first-come, first-served.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nps.gov/sacn">St. Croix National Scenic Riverway</a> near St.
Croix Falls</strong> . I was hiking on the Ice Age
National Scenic Trail when I came across this sweet little campsite with
its own sand beach.</p>
<p>The trail starts in town and winds north along the St. Croix; half a
mile past Lions Park, there's a site with picnic table, tent pad, fire
ring and vault toilet. Being close to water, all of the river sites are
great in summer.</p>
<p>Camping is first-come, first-served, but a free permit is required to
camp on the lower stretch of the river, between St. Croix Falls and
Stillwater. For more information, stop by the new visitors center in St.
Croix Falls.</p>
<p>For more about St. Croix Falls, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/stcroix-falls/">Trail
mix</a>.</p>

Croix</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nps.gov/sacn/">St. Croix National Scenic Riverway</a> near
Grantsburg</strong>. The very scenic <a href="http://www.nps.gov/sacn/planyourvisit/upload/Sandrock%20Trail.pdf">Sandrock
Cliffs
Trail</a>
goes past another great site along the St. Croix, the rustic Sandrock
Cliffs Campground north of Wisconsin 70.</p>
<p>Red pines on a hillside create a room-like atmosphere for tent campers,
who will sleep on a thick bed of fragrant needles. It's rustic, but
this is the place to go for peace and quiet. When we were there one
gorgeous fall weekend, we didn't see anyone.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://townofwestboro.com/2012/mondeaux-flowage-recreation-area/">Mondeaux Recreation
Area</a>
near Medford</strong> . We found this area while
hiking on the Ice Age National Scenic Trail through north-central
Wisconsin. It's part of Chequamegon National Forest, which operates
campgrounds around the lake, formed by the dammed Mondeaux River.</p>
<p>It's remote but civilized. The log <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/cnnf/recreation/?cid=fseprd529776">Mondeaux Dam
Lodge</a>
is being restored, but once served lunch and dinner (and soft-serve ice
cream), had showers and a camp store, and rented canoes, kayaks,
motorboats, paddleboats and pontoons. A Snack Shack is filling in for
it, and even is offering big-screen movies on the beach.</p>
<p>Reserve sites at Spearhead Point, Picnic Point and Eastwood through
<a href="http://www.recreation.gov/">Recreation.Gov</a>. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/ice-age-trail/">Tracing

<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.barnresort.com/">Old Barn Resort</a> near Lanesboro</strong> .
I was riding along the Root River State
Trail, four miles west of Lanesboro, when I spotted some tents through
the trees.</p>
<p>A bit of paved trail led to the campground at Old Barn Resort, where a
pack of bicyclists was heading toward me from the tents. Then I realized
those sites were pretty but too exposed to the sun, and I saw the <em>really</em>
good site: PM28, right next to the
trail but shaded at the foot of a little rise. PM27 is good, too.</p>
<p>There's a swimming pool, restaurant, golf course and canoe and tube
rental on site, plus volleyball and basketball courts.</p>
<p>In Lanesboro, the municipal <a href="https://www.lanesboro.com/list/member/city-of-lanesboro-sylvan-park-campground-3647"><strong>Sylvan Park
campground</strong></a>
is very popular; it's on the edge of downtown and next to the community
center, where showers are $1.</p>
<p>But the <a href="http://www.lanesboro.com/list/member/sylvan-park-riverview-campgrounds-lanesboro-229"><strong>Riverview
campground</strong></a>
just across Parkway Avenue is flatter and less-known; sites are on the
edge of the river and have a beautiful view of the town over the dam.
Both campgrounds are first-come, first-served.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">The belle of bluff

<p><strong><a href="http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/Gull_Lake_Recreation_Area/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=73439">Gull Lake Recreation
Area</a>
near Brainerd</strong> . I saw this U.S. Army Corps of Engineers campground
after touring some of Minnesota's most expensive lake resorts and was
struck by how it had pretty much everything they did — at a tenth of
the price.</p>
<p>It's on the southeast corner of prestigious Gull Lake, around its
outlet into the Gull River. There's a sand beach, playground, nature
trails and a fishing pier. 218-829-3334. Reserve at
<a href="http://www.recreation.gov/">Recreation.Gov</a>.</p>
<p>For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/brainerd-minnesota-summer/">The buzz on

<p><strong><a href="http://www.recreation.gov/camping/Crosslake_Campground/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&amp;parkId=73141">Crosslake Recreation
Area</a>
near Crosslake</strong> . This Corps of Engineers campground, in the Whitefish
Chain on the northeast edge of the Brainerd Lakes area, offers
everything the Gull Lake Recreation Area does, and it's also walking
distance from stores and restaurants.</p>
<p>Reserve at <a href="http://www.recreation.gov/">Recreation.Gov</a>. In Minnesota,
the Corps also runs full-service recreation areas at Leech, Pokegama and
Sandy lakes.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.kcmn.us/departments/county_parks/index.php">Games Lake County
Park</a> near New
London, in west-central Minnesota</strong> . There's nothing tranquil about
this park, just down the road from <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/sibley/index.html">Sibley State
Park</a>,
another popular place to camp. But kids love it.</p>
<p>There's a long, broad sand beach lined with tree-shaded grass and picnic
tables; a slide and two swimming rafts; two volleyball nets; a baseball
diamond; and a store where attendants scoop ice cream and take orders
for the next day's breakfast pastries, just like European campgrounds.</p>
<p>It takes reservations only for stays of seven days or more, starting in
January. Shorter stays are available for walk-ups; call 320-354-4453 in
advance to gauge availability. Dogs are allowed.</p>

<p><strong>Rainy Lake in <a href="http://www.nps.gov/voya">Voyageurs National
Park</a> in far northern Minnesota</strong> .
I spent an afternoon swimming and
reading on the dock at one of the park's Lost Bay sites and gladly would
have spent a week. It had two raised sand tent pads, a grove of white
pine, a picnic table, a privy and a lot of privacy.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nps.gov/voya/planyourvisit/tent-camping.htm">Campsites</a> can
be reserved and cost $16-$24 per night.</p>

Wilderness</a>
in northeast Minnesota</strong> . One August, we
set off from the end of the Gunflint Trail, paddling three lakes and
portaging our canoe and gear nearly two miles to get to Tuscarora Lake.</p>
<p>The first eight campsites we saw were occupied, and we were getting
worried. We got the last one — and settled into our own personal slice
of paradise.</p>
<p>We had a swimming pool at our toes, wildlife at our elbows and an
orchestra hall for our ears. Every sound was amplified — the ringing
call of loons, howls of wolves, other campers singing across the lake.</p>
<p>We loved our campsite, but they're all good. For more, see

<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_forests/facilities/cmp00036/index.html">Mantrap Lake
Campground</a>
in <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_forests/sft00038/index.html">Paul Bunyan State
Forest</a>
near Park Rapids</strong> . I was staying at a lake
resort on Bad Axe Lake and was on a run when I discovered this beautiful
lake campground northeast of Park Rapids. Hmm, I thought — sites here
have the lake, the beach and the forest, but they're a tenth the cost of
a cabin.</p>
<p>As in all Minnesota state forests, sites are inexpensive and first-come,
first-served.</p>
<p>The campground is near <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/index.html">Itasca State
Park</a>, where
campsites are prized but a lot harder to get.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/split_rock_lighthouse/index.html">Split Rock Lighthouse State
Park</a>
near Beaver Bay</strong> . I looked at every site
in the most-coveted camping area in the most popular park in the state,
and there was a clear winner.</p>
<p>Site 16 could be the most scenic camping site in Minnesota, with a
dead-on view of the lighthouse from your own bench perched at the edge
of the cliff (and from the door of your tent). It's also the best site
if you're camping with friends; it shares a spur from the trail with
No. 17, which has a view nearly as good.</p>

bicycling on the paved Migizi Trail. There are 24 first-come,
first-served rustic sites, all shaded by red pines and half with their
own little stretch of beach.</p>
<p>The 17-mile trail winds around the lake to <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/chippewa/recarea/?recid=26708">Norway Beach Recreation
Area</a>,
which has a more luxurious campground and some sites that can be
reserved. 218-335-8600.</p>
<p>Walker is the nearest resort town. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/walker-leech-lake/">Fishing in
Walker</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.hoksilapark.org/">Hok-Si-La Municipal Park</a> near Lake City</strong>.
This wooded cart-in tent campground has a great location on Lake
Pepin. Sites overlooking the lake (a wide spot on the Mississippi River)
book up first, especially B10-12, G0 and G2.</p>
<p>No site is far from the big sand beach, and there's a store, bathhouse
(use the new one), playground and free use of basketballs, volleyballs,
horseshoes and footballs.</p>
<p>If you're a light sleeper, however, you may not like this campground.
Trains are nearly a mile away, but they run all night and blow their
whistles a dozen times as they pass.</p>
<p>On holidays, there's a three-night minimum. Mosquitoes can be a
problem, but the park sprays weekly.</p>

Pepin</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Lake Agnes on the <a href="https://superiorhiking.org/trail-section/lutsen-to-grand-marais/">Superior Hiking Trail near
Lutsen</a></strong>
. You'll be in the catbird seat if you get one of these backpacking
campsites at one of the prettiest spots on the trail.</p>
<p>One is on the lake, and one is in a maple grove that overlooks it. Both
have four tent pads and a vault toilet, and your water comes from the
lake, so bring a filter.</p>
<p>Like all of the 82 sites on the trail, they're first-come,
first-served. If a party already is at a site but a tent pad is
available, it's supposed to share.</p>

Trail</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/whitewater/index.html">Whitewater State
Park</a>
near St. Charles</strong> . This park in southeast
Minnesota is famous for its wide variety of spring ephemerals. When you
go to the park office for a map of the trails, and you ask about
wildflowers, rangers often will send you to the trail through the
walk-in campsites &quot;because it has everything.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of the trail, next to the Whitewater River and against the
bluff, is campsite W4. It's got a grill pit, wood box, picnic table . .
. and lots of blooms.</p>
<p>Even more spectacular are the rustic sites along the North Branch of the
Whitewater River in neighboring <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/carley/index.html">Carley State
Park</a>. In the
first half of May, they're surrounded by thousands of bluebells and
clouds of false rue anemone.</p>
<h3>Michigan</h3>
<p><strong>Michigan state parks along the east coast of Lake Michigan</strong> :
There are 15 beach parks with
campgrounds between Mackinaw City and the Indiana border, all very
popular.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_city_beach.jpg" alt="The beach at Hok-Si-La park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=468&amp;type=SPRK">Ludington State
Park</a>
is like a resort, with a beach on an inland lake as well as Lake
Michigan, river tubing, bike trails, concerts and a lighthouse that can
be climbed. It has three campgrounds.</p>
<p>North of Manistee, <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=480&amp;type=SPRK">Orchard Beach State
Park</a>
is small, but many of its blufftop campsites have views of Lake
Michigan, and its beach, reached by stairs, is less crowded than many.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=458&amp;type=SPRK">Holland State
Park</a>, RVs can park right next to the gorgeous beach, though they're packed
together on concrete. Tent campers stay in a more wooded Lake Macatawa
campground a short walk away.</p>
<p>Campsites can and should be reserved six months in advance, because
nearly all the beach parks are 100 percent reservable.</p>
<p>If you want to travel at the last minute, head for the Upper Peninsula.
<a href="https://www.uptravel.com/places-to-stay-2/campgrounds/">Campgrounds</a>
there are much less likely to be full.</p>

<p><strong>Chapel Campground in Michigan's
<a href="http://www.nps.gov/piro">Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</a> near
Munising</strong> . We came upon this rustic
six-site campground while hiking the Lakeshore Trail atop sandstone
cliffs.</p>
<p>Tents are tucked amid pines, and there are wooden steps down the cliff
that lead to that rare thing: a sandy beach on Lake Superior, just the
ticket on a hot day.</p>
<p>The Chapel and Mosquito sites are most popular; reserve at least two
weeks in advance or as early as Jan. 1. Send or fax the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/backcountry.htm">back-country
camping form</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.decorahia.org/pr/pr.asp?id=prpulpit_rock">Pulpit Rock
Campground</a> in
Decorah</strong> . We camped at this city-run
campground one crisp fall weekend. It's on the west edge of town,
wedged between the bluffs (it's named for one of the limestone
outcroppings), the Upper Iowa River and Trout Run Creek.</p>
<p>We pitched our tent along the rushing creek to be close to the
bathrooms, but sites along the river get the morning and afternoon sun.
A pair of fishermen from Des Moines were there and said they've been
coming for 40 years to fish for trout in the usually shallow river.</p>
<p>An outfitter just up the river rents canoes, kayaks and tubes, and the
campground is on the gorgeous, paved Trout Run Trail, which circles the
city.</p>
<p>The best thing about the campground? Really clean showers.</p>
<p>It's first-come, first-served. RV sites fill on weekends, but there's
nearly always space for tents.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/sleepinggiant">Sleeping Giant Provincial
Park</a> near Thunder
Bay</strong> . When we camped on Sleeping Giant Provincial Park, an hour east
of Thunder Bay on the Sibley Peninsula, we were delighted by our
secluded campsite on the shore of Marie Louise Lake, Site 311.</p>
<p>It was a lot like being in the Boundary Waters, except we could carry
all of our food and other stuff down from the cooler in the car.</p>
<p>Then, we loved the backpacking sites we saw on Tee Harbor, some in
wooded groves right off the sand beach and another with its own
cobblestone beach, woodpile and chair carved into a tree stump. They
have food lockers and outhouses, too.</p>
<p>But the one we loved most was Site 140, right on the point in Marie
Louise Lake Campground. We could swim from our site in the ultra-clean
lake and take hot showers nearby. Best of all, it was the quietest
campground we'd ever slept in.</p>
<p>Sites 138-141 and odd-numbered sites 143-167 also are on the waterfront
and should be reserved five months in advance at 888-668-7275 or online
at <a href="https://www.ontarioparks.com/reservations">Ontario Parks</a>.</p>
<p>They're quite expensive, though, $36.75-$46 in the secluded area and
on the campground. Backpacking sites are $10 per adult and $4.75 for
children 6-17.</p>
