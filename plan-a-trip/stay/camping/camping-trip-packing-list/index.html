<p>Tent camping is the best deal in travel. You can go at the last minute,
you get the most scenic locations and you pay a pittance.</p>
<p>It's too bad about all that stuff you have to bring along.</p>
<p>Some super-organized people love to pack gear and have most of it ready
to go after the last camping trip. But most of us aren't that kind of
person.</p>
<p>Most of us just want to head out the door and go. But if you want to
save on a hotel bill, you've got to bring stuff.</p>
<p>The question is, how much? Here's how to make it easy on yourself.</p>
<p>The easiest way, especially if you have kids, is to join one of
Minnesota's <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/can_camp.html">I Can
Camp!</a> programs,
where all the gear is provided.</p>
<p>Even if you have a roof, the packing list can get complicated. For more,
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/cabin-packing-list/">What to bring to a rented
cabin</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>What you need to run out the door: the basics</h3>
<p>Technically, all you need is a <em>tent</em> , a <em>sleeping bag</em> , a <em>sleeping
pad</em> and a <em>pillow</em> .</p>
<p>If you don't have a sleeping bag or pad, make a sleep sack from an old
flannel sheet and bring a yoga mat. And you can always make a pillow by
stuffing your clothes into an old pillowcase.</p>
<p>If you like to keep clean, bring a toiletry bag, including <em>soap</em> , and
a <em>towel</em> .</p>
<p>If you're a light sleeper, bring <em>ear plugs</em> .</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>But don't you need a cooler? No, because the easiest way to keep things
simple while camping is to not cook.</p>
<p>I like staying in municipal campgrounds, such as the ones in Lanesboro,
because then I can stroll over to a deli, bakery or even a farmers
market.</p>
<p>I do, however, bring a little <em>electric</em> <em>hotpot</em> . In the morning, I
plug it into a bathhouse outlet and make myself coffee, which I enjoy
with fruit and muffins.</p>

If you camp on a famous trout stream, like the one that runs past Pulpit
Rock Campground in Decorah, Iowa, don't forget your fishing pole.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Some campgrounds have on-site or adjoining restaurants, such as Saxon
Harbor County Park on Lake Superior in northern Wisconsin. It's among
our <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/great-campsites-midwest/">30 great campsites</a>, along with
Lanesboro's two city campgrounds.</p>
<p>For 15 state-park campgrounds that are near a whole portfolio of
amenities, including restaurants, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/easy-camping-state-parks/">Camping without roughing
it</a>.</p>
<h3>A few extras that will make you happy</h3>
<p>Everyone's different, but at the end of the day, I like to sit in a
<em>lightweight folding camp chair</em> and have a cold beer out of a <em>small
cooler</em> .</p>
<p>And that <em>coffee</em> I make? It's rich, cold-brewed concentrate, perfect
for travel. No grounds; just add hot water. You can buy a Filtron or
Toddy kit and make it yourself, or buy some already made at Trader
Joe's.</p>
<p>Before sleeping, I like to read a book with my <em>headlamp</em> , which also
comes in handy for middle-of-the-night potty runs. If you're camping
later in the season, when nightfall comes early, it's fun to watch a
movie on a laptop.</p>
<p>If it rains, you'll be happy to have a <em>game</em> — a deck of cards or
Bananagrams don't take up much room.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Most people like a campfire. In that case, don't forget <em>kindling</em> and
a <em>fire starter</em> . Buy your wood on-site, so you don't transport any
nasty bugs.</p>
<h3>A few extras that will make you comfortable</h3>
<p>You'll need <em>bug repellent</em> — unless you camp in southeast Minnesota,
which is so well-drained it has very few mosquitoes. For more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-without-mosquitoes/">Getting away from mosquitoes</a>.</p>
<p>To cut down on the clothes you need, leave your cotton at home and bring
only <em>quick-dry synthetics</em> . If you dribble ice cream on your shirt,
just rinse it off and put it back on.</p>
<p>A <em>quick-dry microfiber towel</em> is invaluable, too. You can use it to dry
yourself, your tent, your picnic table, etc.</p>
<p>Pack <em>sunscreen</em> and a <em>hat</em> , to avoid burns and wrinkles.</p>
<p>Park bathhouses are not always spick and span, so bring <em>flip-flops</em> for
the shower. <em>Water shoes</em> are great for climbing around waterfalls and
on rocky beaches.</p>
<h3>A few extras that are handy to have</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/l/flambeau_campsite.jpg" alt="Camping at Lac du Flambeau Tribal Campground." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Lac du Flambeau Tribal Campground in northern Wisconsin is a short
walk from a grocery store.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Visit any outdoors or sporting goods store, and you'll find all kinds
of handy camping doodads. It's easy to go overboard, but remember,
you're trying not to have too much stuff.</p>
<p>I do like a <em>collapsing cup</em> for my toiletry bag, so I can brush my
teeth. And if you're camping in a place that doesn't have showers, you
can wash your hair with the help of a <em>collapsing water bucket</em> .</p>
<p>If you wear contacts, it's easier to put them in with the help of a
small <em>mirror</em> .</p>
<p>For washing hands and dishes, you'll want a <em>water container with a
spout</em> that you can rest on your picnic table. If you don't plan to
drink from it, just use an old laundry detergent container.</p>
<p>Even if you don't cook at your campsite, you'll probably be cutting
fruit or making sandwiches for picnics. In that case, you'll want a
<em>cutting board</em> and a decent <em>knife with a sheath</em> .</p>
<p>If it hasn't rained lately, the ground may be hard, and you might need
a <em>hammer</em> to pound in your tent spikes.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>If it's going to rain, a <em>tarp</em> comes in handy to protect your wood,
your bikes, your picnic table and so on.</p>
<p>It never hurts to have a first-aid kit, though most people don't need
anything more than a <em>Band-Aid</em> or two. If you'll be in a remote place
and are worried about safety, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/survival-tips-outdoors/">Don't be a dope in the
woods</a>.</p>
<h3>Some handy tricks</h3>
<p>Instead of ice, I use <em>frozen juice boxes</em> in my small cooler. A few of
those are enough to keep my beer cold, and in the morning I have cold
juice.</p>
<p>You can also use frozen brats, which are easy to cook on a stick over a
campfire.</p>

for pennies.</p>
