<h2>For a beach vacation on a budget, stay at cabins and campgrounds in state parks.</h2>

<p>No summer vacation is more fun than a Circle Tour of a Great
Lakes — and nothing is more of a pain than planning one.</p>
<p>Fans of sand and sun love Lake Michigan, which is lined by state and
city parks with gorgeous stretches of sand and dunes. You can't buy a
better beach vacation at any price, but you have to plan ahead.</p>
<p>Planning is tricky because you pass through four states, 30 state parks
and two big metropolitan areas, each of which floods beaches with hordes
of sun-worshippers on weekends.</p>
<p>You have to navigate around big festivals that fill every hotel and
campground within 50 miles — if you arrive in Traverse City without a
reservation during National Cherry Festival, for example, you'll be
sleeping in your car.</p>
<p>Nearly every desirable place in tourist areas has a two-night minimum on
weekends, so you'll either be spending two nights or staying in a Super
8.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>And you can't count on getting walk-up campsites: In Michigan, the most
popular beach parks are <em>100 percent reservable,</em> and weekends are
booked immediately when reservations open six months in advance.</p>
<p>If you want to camp indoors on a summer weekend in Michigan state parks,
it's best to reserve the mini-cabins, rustic cabins, camper cabins and
guesthouses along this Midwestern Riviera a year in advance.</p>
<p>But midweek openings stay available much longer, especially in state
parks on the Upper Peninsula. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/michigan-state-park-cabins/">Michigan's great lake
cabins</a>.</p>
<p>For more about Michigan's beach parks, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-lake-michigan/">America's freshwater
Riviera</a>.</p>
<p>For last-minute stays, look for parks with rustic or hike-in sites,
which are slower to be reserved. For example, Harrington Beach State
Park, between Milwaukee and Sheboygan, has plenty of sites a stone's
throw from Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>On Lake Michigan, you don't need to spend much for a great beach
vacation. Here's how to do it.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Camping around Lake Michigan</h3>
<p><em>When to go:</em> The last half of June and August are good times to
travel; the tourist areas are crowded in July and the first half of
August. Allow at least a week, more if you want to tour Door County or
add a side trip to the Soo Locks at Sault Ste. Marie (only an hour from
St. Ignace on the Mackinac Straits).</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/michigan_wells_minicabin.jpg" alt="A mini-cabin in Michigan state parks." /><p class="copyright">&copy; David Kenyon/DNR</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Not far from the Wisconsin border, Michigan's J.W. Wells State Park has
five large rustic cabins.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Planning a route:</em> The entire Circle Tour of Lake Michigan is about
1,160 miles, including the Door Peninsula.</p>
<p>For help planning a trip, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-circle-tour/">Circling Lake
Michigan</a>,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/plan-circle-tour-lake-michigan/">Planning a Circle Tour of Lake
Michigan</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-tour/">Lake Michigan with
kids</a>.</p>
<p>You can shorten the route and avoid Chicago-area traffic and industrial
Gary, Ind., by talking the <a href="http://www.lake-express.com/">Lake Express High-Speed
Ferry</a> between Milwaukee and Muskegon,
Mich. The crossing takes 2½ hours.</p>
<p>You can cut the route even shorter by taking the the <a href="http://www.ssbadger.com/">S.S. Badger Car
Ferry</a> between Manitowoc, Wis., and Ludington,
Mich. The crossing takes four hours.</p>
<p><em>Sightseeing:</em> Sights include <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/best-sights-mackinac-island/">Mackinac
Island</a>,
the re-created fur-post site Colonial Michilimackinac in Mackinaw City
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/sleeping-bear-dunes/">Sleeping Bear Dunes National
Lakeshore</a>.</p>
<p><em>Beaches:</em> For a guide to some of the best, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-lake-michigan/">America's freshwater
Riviera</a>.</p>
<p><em>Camping:</em> You can camp in a tent or RV, or you can stay in a rustic
cabin, mini-cabin, camper cabin or fully equipped lodge.</p>
<p>All of the state parks below offer
modern camping except where noted. In a pinch, stay in a state forest;
they're not on the beach, but they're nearby.</p>

one sleeps 14 and the other 16, $60 or $5 per person.</p>

pit, pump and latrine, but no electricity. There's also a covered
pavilion for eating. Reserve up to 11 months in advance.</p>
<p>The state forest's modern campground also is close to the beach and
nature lodge/concession center.</p>
<p><em>Door County</em> has four state parks with camping. <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/Potawatomi/">Potawatomi State
Park</a> in <em>Sturgeon Bay</em>
has one accessible <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/camping/cabin.html">cabin for people with

<p>It also has two accessible campsites. <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/peninsula/">Peninsula State
Park</a> has the most
coveted camping sites in Wisconsin. The park is almost like a resort,
with beaches, bicycle trails, a professional theater and a golf course,
and it's adjacent to shopping and restaurants in <em>Fish Creek and
Ephraim.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/newport/">Newport State Park</a> near
<em>Ellison Bay,</em>  Wisconsin's only wilderness park, has some rustic sites

Michigan and a stone's throw from Europe Lake.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/rockisland/">Rock Island State Park</a>
has campsites on lovely beaches, but access requires two ferry
crossings. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/rock-island-state-park-wisconsin/">Wisconsin's Icelandic

DNR Reservations</a>, 800-447-2757. If

in 15 minutes or all your work will disappear.</p>

coast of Lake Michigan, 100 percent of sites can be reserved, so it's
crucial to reserve early for summer weekends.</p>

517-373-9900.</p>
<p>The non-resident annual parks permit is $31. The daily admission for a
vehicle is $9. Michigan residents can get an annual vehicle permit by
paying an additional $11 on their license plate renewals.</p>
<p>Michigan also has a wide variety of <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-350-79137_79782_8022-,00.html"><strong>camper cabins, mini-cabins,
rustic cabins and
lodges</strong></a>
that can be reserved <em>one year</em> in advance. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/michigan-state-park-cabins/">Michigan's
great lake cabins</a>.</p>
<p>In the mini-cabins, rustic cabins and camper cabins, campers must bring
all bedding, cookware and tableware. Bunkbeds and mattresses are
provided. Cooking must be done outside, where there are picnic tables
and grills or fire rings. Pets are not permitted inside.</p>

bunk beds in their own rooms and a futon in the main living area.
They're on scenic lots overlooking lakes, bays and rivers and have a
covered front porch.</p>
<p>They have microwaves, refrigerators and coffee makers, and some have
ceiling fans and toasters. All are universally accessible.</p>
<p><strong>Mini-cabins</strong> generally are slightly smaller than a rustic cabin and
sleep four. Some are accessible, and some aren't.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong>Rustic cabins</strong> are on quiet, isolated sites and accommodate two to 24

equipped kitchens, and bedding and towels are provided. Many have
washers and dryers and some have televisions and DVD players.</p>
