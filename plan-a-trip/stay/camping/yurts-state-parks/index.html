<h2>In Clear Lake, a weekend stay is so simple, it's hardly camping.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/l/clear_lake_yurt.jpg" alt="A green canvas-sided yurt looks over Clear Lake in Iowa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Two yurts have their own corner of McIntosh Woods State Park in northern
Iowa, overlooking Clear Lake.

<p>One June, I was a very lazy camper.</p>
<p>I threw a sleeping bag and pillow into the car and drove two hours down
Interstate 35 to Clear Lake, Iowa. I didn't bother to look for company;
in early June, most people where I live want to go north, not south.</p>
<p>It was their loss. McIntosh Woods State Park is on one of Iowa's most
popular lakes, a big expanse of sparkling water that was scoured out by
glaciers and sits above the surrounding countryside, catching breezes on
hot days.</p>
<p>The park has a sand beach and boat launch, and it's connected by bike
lanes to the laid-back beach town of Clear Lake.</p>
<p>Iowa state parks don't charge an entrance fee, and when I got to
McIntosh Woods, the office was locked. The only staff turned out to be
Andy Carter, whom I found down at the beach, raking out the sand.</p>
<p>He said he'd meet me back at the office and asked where I was from.</p>
<p>&quot;I was born in St. Paul, and I don't ever want to go back,&quot; he said.
&quot;Too many people. I've got it made right here; it's peaceful.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He collected a $50 damage deposit, then showed me to a little green
yurt on the lake. With one other yurt, it had its own dock and its own
bathhouse, with hot showers and flush toilets, and there were two picnic
tables, grills and firepits.</p>
<p>The two yurts sat all by themselves in a private, oak-shaded cul de sac,
pretty posh for $35 a night. Then it occurred to me that it also would
be perfect for late-night, blow-out beer parties.</p>
<p>Carter assured me that kind of thing didn't happen much.</p>
<p>&quot;I patrol until midnight,&quot; he said. &quot;I'll keep an eye on you.&quot;</p>
<p>As it turned out, my fellow yurt guests weren't wild at all. Lindsey
Beglinger was a  middle-school custodian from Huxley, Iowa, who has an
interest in sustainable housing, and she'd brought her little brother,
William.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, this is like our own private campground,&quot; Beglinger said. &quot;I've
always wanted to stay in a yurt.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/l/clear_lake_bicyclist.jpg" alt="A bicyclist rides along the shore of Clear Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>She'd reserved her yurt Feb. 13, nine days before I had, when most
summer weekends already were filled. But we'd ended up with a lovely
weekend: warm and sunny, with cool nights.</p>
<p>The walleye were biting, and fishermen huddled around the nearby
cleaning station late into the night.</p>
<p>The annual Take Me Back oldies music festival had brought thousands of
people to Clear Lake's lakeside City Park, and the Lady of the Lake
paddlewheeler had started its cruise season.</p>
<p>Lindsey and William mostly hung out at their yurt, fixing foil-wrapped
meat and potatoes over their grill.</p>
<p>But I explored the area, riding the 15 miles around the lake on my bike
and walking to dinner at Rich's Muskie Lounge, a popular restaurant that
has a patio overlooking the lake and is only a block from the yurts.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Beglingers' mother, Leslee, joined them, and she, too,
was impressed.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been Girl Scouts for a long time, and for us, good times are a
tent with animals underneath it and a leak,&quot; she said. &quot;So this is
pretty nice. This is fabulous.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They invited me over for s'mores that evening, but when I returned from
a late dinner at one of the Italian restaurants facing City Park, they'd
already gone to bed.</p>
<p>I slept so well on my full-size futon, with the ceiling fan whirring
softly overhead, that I barely made it out by check-out time, when park
manager Tammy Domonoske came down to see what I was doing.</p>
<p>With help from volunteers, Domonoske built the yurts from kits bought
from the Colorado Yurt Co. in Montrose, Colo.</p>
<p>The kits for a basic, 16-inch yurt with a screen door, extra window and
ceiling-fan mount include the rafters, lattice walls of Douglas fir,
fabric cover and acrylic skylight. Domonoske and her crew used recycled
materials to make the deck, plank flooring and furniture.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an interesting project,&quot; she said. &quot;It's been holding up really
well.&quot;</p>
<p>Before she put it up, Domonoske said, she consulted Ted Young on
Minnesota's Gunflint Trail, who has become known as &quot;the yurt guy&quot; of
the Midwest.</p>
<p>In 1984, Young wanted to offer lodge-to-lodge skiing on the 28-kilometer
Banadad Trail, but the U.S. Forest Service wouldn't allow a permanent
dwelling on federal land.</p>

<p>His wife, Barbara, read about yurts in Cross Country Skier magazine and
suggested they get one, but he said, &quot;It's silly; who's going to stay in
that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those were Ted's exact words,&quot; says Barbara Young with a laugh. &quot;Six
months later, another resorter said, 'I just read something fascinating
about yurts,' and he looked into it and said, 'This is something we
should look into.' &quot;</p>
<p>They ordered a kit, and Barbara sewed the canvas, grommet holes and all,
on a portable machine in a one-room cabin without electricity. The first
year, they had to take the yurt down in spring, but then they got
permission to leave it up.</p>
<p>&quot;When we started, we called it a hut, because we didn't think anyone
would know what a yurt was,&quot; Ted Young said. &quot;But now everyone in the
skiing community knows what they are, so after three or four years, we
changed it to yurt.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Yurts in Iowa</h3>
<p>Yurt guests need to bring bedding, pillows, towels and toiletries, plus
cooking equipment. No cooking is allowed inside the yurt; generally,
each one has a picnic table and fire pit and/or grill.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Guests may want to bring camping chairs if the yurt has a deck. As at
camper cabins, guests are expected to clean up after themselves.
Usually, there's a two-night minimum.</p>
