<h2>In the north woods, golden oldies recall a vanished era.</h2>

Near Cable, Garmisch USA overlooks Namekagon Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the north woods, only the passage of time creates a classic.</p>
<p>There's nothing like the feel of a vintage lodge. Whatever it comes
from — the burnished logs hewed by ax, the hearths made of stones
picked from local fields, the faint fragrance of aged pine and cedar —
it can't be ordered from the local furniture store.</p>
<p>Once, the north woods of Wisconsin were full of lodges. The first were
built as fishing camps, after loggers left in the 1890s, and guests were
affluent sportsmen who arrived by rail.</p>
<p>Then roads were built in the 1920s, automobiles became more affordable
and families began to arrive in droves.</p>
<p>The next four decades were the golden age of lake resorts.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the '20s and '30s, many northern Wisconsin resorts were patronized
by gangsters from Chicago, whose flamboyant behavior provided locals
with a rich vein of lore.</p>
<p>In the late '40s and '50s, the burgeoning middle class made resorts
with housekeeping cabins popular.</p>
<p>But their numbers are shrinking fast as lakeshore property values go
through the roof and aging resort owners sell to people who tear down
the cottages to build one &quot;cabin.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, only a few classic lodges survive to give us a glimpse of a
golden era.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Classic Wisconsin lodges</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.garmischresort.com/">Garmisch USA</a> near Cable, Wis.</strong> :
This 1927 resort in northwest Wisconsin
is only eight miles down the road from Telemark Resort — also inspired
by the village of Garmisch in the Bavarian Alps, where its founder, the
late Tony Wise, was stationed as a GI in postwar Germany.</p>
<p>The Germanic romanticism of Garmisch USA, however, is borrowed not from
the ski slopes but from medieval hunting lodges. The two-story great
room features an iron chandelier, suits of armor and strings of muskie,
foxes, stags, bobcats and ducks.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/a/hayward_spider_lake_lodge.jpg" alt="Inside Spider Lake Lodge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The interior of the 1923 Spider Lake Lodge near Hayward glows with the
patina of polished wood.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There are seven lodge rooms, six with fireplaces; a suite; and cottages
of various sizes, including the five-bedroom, five-bath Castle. An
equally atmospheric restaurant specializes in German dishes and has a
great view of the lake.</p>
<p>For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-cable-wisconsin/">High color in
Cable</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.spiderlakelodge.com/">Spider Lake Lodge</a> B&amp;B near Hayward,
Wis.</strong> : This log lodge on Spider Lake was
built in 1923 by Chicago auto mechanic Ted Moody and an Ojibwe
carpenter. In Chicago, Moody had worked as a mechanic at a garage that
serviced Al Capone's cars; Capone's 1925 retreat is nearby, in
Couderay.</p>
<p>Today, the handsomely restored lodge's atmosphere is intentionally
quiet. A full breakfast is served. It has seven rooms and suites, each
sleeping two.</p>
<p>For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/indulgent-retreats/hayward-wisconsin-shops-inns/">Unwinding in
Hayward</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.bents-camp.com/">Bent's Camp</a> near Land O' Lakes, Wis.</strong>
: Near the Michigan border, this lodge began life in 1896 as a camp for
sportsmen, brought over from the railroad landing in a wooden scow
called the Tar Baby.</p>
<p>A log restaurant was built in 1906, with interior walls covered by thick
squares of birch bark held in place by cedar strips.</p>
<p>Today, it's one of the north woods' most treasured spots. In the bar,
old photos illustrate the resort's early history and a fire crackles in
the stone fireplace.</p>
<p>In the restaurant, diners sit in a room lined with paned windows
overlooking Mamie Lake or in the wood-paneled big room under the gaze of
a giant stag head.</p>
<p>There are two cabins open in winter, patronized by snowmobilers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.vossbl.com/">Voss' Birchwood Lodge</a> in Manitowish Waters</strong> :
This gracious resort on a bay of Spider
Lake figured heavily in the 1934 shootout at nearby Little Bohemia
Lodge, where John Dillinger was staying — its owners, Henry and Ruth
Voss, called the FBI on him, and the agents staged their raid there.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/manitowish_voss_sign.jpg" alt="Voss' Birchwood Lodge in Manitowish Waters." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Voss' Birchwood Lodge, a vintage sign readers, "Think the world is
moving too fast? Well, step ashore & visit the past."
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The Vosses founded the resort in 1910, and today it's run by their
granddaughter and great-grandson. Guests stay in 20 cabins and six lodge
rooms, open from Memorial Day weekend through early October.</p>
<p>There's a restaurant and small bar in the atmospheric 1924 lodge, and
the Old Settler's Inn on the highway serves lunch. If you stop by, be
sure to see the historic wooden footbridge that crosses the bay.</p>

Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.rentwisconsincabins.com/detail.php?id=1566">Inn at
Pinewood</a> near
Eagle River, Wis</strong> .: This eight-bedroom, eight-bath lodge, on the shore
of private Carpenter Lake, was built in 1934 as a hunting and fishing
lodge.</p>
<p>It became a youth camp in 1969, a college-prep academy in 1974, a B&amp;B in
1991 and a vacation rental in 2017. Today, each era contributes to its
highly distinctive look.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On its sprawling main floor, part of it made of old barn planks,
there's a big white wolf, an old trap and a lynx with a grouse in its
mouth, from its hunting-lodge days.</p>
<p>From the youth-camp days, there's a vintage electronic shuffleboard
game, dart board and giant chess set. From the B&amp;B era, there are
antiques.</p>
<p>It's a good spot for a group, because the main level has many areas
where people can congregate. Next door, a three-bedroom home also can be
rented.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.coonsfranklinlodge.com/">Coon's Franklin Lodge</a> near
Arbor Vitae</strong> : This genteel resort on Trout
Lake is the closest Wisconsin gets to a Gatsby-era lake resort. People
who love the classic north-woods look will swoon over its log lodge and
30 cabins, surrounded by white pine and cedar.</p>
<p>Reached by a long, unpaved road, Coon's is perhaps the last American
Plan-only resort in the state; all guests are served three meals a day
in the octagonal log dining room.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minocqua_coons.jpg" alt="Coons' Franklin Lodge near Minocqua." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Minocqua, Coon's Franklin Lodge was built as a hunting and fishing
camp in 1892.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>All of the cabins have screened porches and fireplaces. The resort is
open from the first weekend of June through Labor Day, and early- and
late-season rates are discounted.</p>
<p>Only week-long reservations are accepted, unless there's a last-minute
cancellation.</p>

Minocqua</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.redcrownlodge.com">Red Crown Lodge</a> near Arbor Vitae</strong> :
This elegant resort on Trout Lake was established in 1922 by Standard
Oil as a corporate retreat.</p>
<p>In 2001, a Madison developer bought it and opened it for all groups,
including family reunions; it rents to just one group at a time. The
Trout Lake Golf Club is nearby, and dining is in the Main Lodge.</p>
