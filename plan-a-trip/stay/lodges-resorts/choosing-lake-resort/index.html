<h2>Somewhere in lakes country, there's a resort with your name on it. Here's how to find it.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/r/crow_wing_raft_jumpers.jpg" alt="Kids jump off the raft at a Minnesota lake resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
For children, a lake resort is the best possible vacation.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>After many years of traveling around this region, I can answer nearly
every travel question except one: &quot;Can you give me the name of a good
lake resort?&quot;</p>
<p>I wish I could, but no. Only you know what you consider a good lake
resort.</p>
<p>Staying at a north-woods lake resort is not like staying at a Marriott.
There may be chipmunks living under your cabin, and fish that nibble
your legs when you wade. Squealing children may run past your window
while you're trying to read.</p>
<p>You may find these things alarming. For you, there are resorts with
all-day children's programs, pools, and new townhouse units on manicured
grounds.</p>
<p>Or, you may think chipmunks are cute, adore the sounds of children at
play and be happy to commune with crappies. You'll probably do just fine
in a classic knotty-pine cabin surrounded by trees.</p>
<p>Each of the resorts in Minnesota and Wisconsin is one of a kind, and you
may not know if you'll click at a resort until you stay there. But
there's definitely one for you — you just have to look.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>And for those who remember childhood stays at cabins with ratty brown
carpets and needlelike showers, there's good news: They've had a face
lift.</p>
<p>Things have changed since the 1950s, when resort amenities rarely
included more than bait and tackle, a fish-cleaning shed, docks and,
perhaps, a playground for the kids.</p>
<p>Today, some resorts offer so many activities that guests may not find
time to fish, and so many luxuries - satellite TV, whirlpools,
WiFi — they won't know they've left home.</p>
<p>Other resorts, while mindful of modern preferences, have drawn the line.</p>
<p>&quot;We still want them to feel like they're in the woods at our cabins, so
we don't want them to feel like condos,&quot; says Sue Harris, who runs
Eagle Nest Lodge on a bay of Minnesota's Lake Winnibigoshish.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll add things to make them nicer, but we don't want them to get too
nice, know what I mean?&quot; She laughed.</p>
<p>Eagle Nest is one of the few 1920s fishing resorts that still cater to
serious fishermen and also have a strong family atmosphere. Harris and
her husband, Bryan, have installed a  playground, a water trampoline and
a full-time naturalist who organizes several activities a day, such as
hobo hikes and hillside tube slides.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/r/crow_wing_canoe.jpg" alt="Canoeing at a lake resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;People like feeling they can be entertained while they're here, but to
tell you the truth, they don't all use those programs, either,&quot; she
says. &quot;We really emphasize the lake, the enjoyment of the woods,
promoting quiet.&quot;</p>
<p>So do you want quiet times or tee times? Canoeing or NASCAR races?</p>
<p>Think about what really makes you happy — and if that means not having
to cook, or getting lots of time away from the kids, be honest and go
for it.</p>
<p>Then, follow these steps.</p>
<h3>Pick the area that suits you</h3>
<p>Traditional lake resorts have been disappearing fast, cut up and sold
for private vacation homes. But there are still more than a thousand in
the north woods of Minnesota and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>If you have no idea how to pick one, first narrow your search by
choosing a lakes area. Each has the basics - lakes, golf courses,
shopping.</p>
<p>Beyond that, each caters to a different kind of vacationer. It all
depends on what kind of relaxing you plan to do.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>

<h3>Decide how much you can spend</h3>
<p>Most resorts offer the basics - housekeeping cabins, a lodge, a sandy
beach, a playground and use of canoes and paddleboats.</p>
<p>For many families, that's all that's required for a wonderful
vacation. At these resorts, expect to pay at least $1,000 for an
updated, two-bedroom cabin and $2,000 for a three-bedroom in peak
season.</p>
<p>At bigger resorts that offer all the extras - a nine-hole golf course,
tennis courts, restaurants, a pool and whirlpool, supervised children's
programs  — add a thousand more.</p>
<h3>Decide when you want to go</h3>
<p>The weather is most reliable from late June to mid-August, which is peak
season and books up fastest. It's not too late to find a cabin for those
times, though selection will be limited.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baileys_harbor_gordon_lodge.jpg" alt="Gordon Lodge on North Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Some lake resorts are fancy and some modest.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But there's plenty of room in early June or late August, and nearly
every resort offers substantial discounts for those weeks.</p>
<p>In addition, most lake resorts offer Memorial Day and Labor Day weekend
specials - often, four nights for the price of three  — and many
offer 10 days for the price of seven the week before and including Labor
Day.</p>
<p>If you do go early in the season, and you have kids, book at a resort
with a heated pool.</p>
<p>Though a week's rental still is the standard in peak season, more and
more resorts are offering partial weeks, often called &quot;mini-vacations.&quot;</p>
<h3>Consider the kids</h3>
<p>If you have a toddler, pick a resort with a big, sandy beach that slopes
gradually into the water. Elementary-age children enjoy resorts that
offer a simple but fun daily activity, such as scavenger hunts, minnow
races and sandcastle contests.</p>
<p>Teens will want an area where they can congregate with other teens, such
as a game room or a pool. And make sure there's not a bar — nothing
kills a family atmosphere faster.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Collect information</h3>
<p>Using the Internet doesn't really save time, but it will net you a whole
lot of good information.</p>
<p>(One tip: The word &quot;modern&quot; usually means only that the cabin has
up-to-date plumbing, heating and appliances. The words &quot;newly built&quot;
or &quot;recently remodeled&quot; are more specific.)</p>
<p>Get the visitors guide for your chosen region and start comparing ads
and websites, which often list Internet specials.</p>
<p>Consult the staff at regional tourism bureaus; they can't recommend
resorts, but they can give you names if you're specific about what you
want.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.exploreminnesota.com/places-to-stay/resorts/">Explore
Minnesota</a>
lists more than 750 resorts &quot;located on a lake or river,&quot; and you
can select other amenities, too. For more help, contact a <a href="http://www.exploreminnesota.com/contactTravelCounselor.aspx">travel

<p><a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/places-to-stay/resorts-lodges">Travel
Wisconsin</a>
lists more than 500 resorts &quot;on water,&quot; and you can pick other
amenities, too. For help, call 800-432-8747.</p>

Nearly every lake resort has a playground for children.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Ask questions</h3>
<p>Once you've used the Internet to select a few possibilities, <em>pick up
the telephone</em> !</p>
<p>The personality of the owners dictates the atmosphere of the resort, so
you need to make personal contact.</p>
<p>&quot;The more information they can give me, the more I can tell them if it's
going to be a good fit,&quot; says resort owner Stacy Fay.</p>
<p>Ask if it's the kind of informal resort where children can run around,
or if it caters more to couples who keep to themselves.</p>
<p>Ask if there's much drinking, or if many guests or nearby cabin owners
like to use wave-runners. Ask if the beach is weedy.</p>
<p>Ask if there's a big family group that dominates the place during the
week you're considering. If so, ask if they're friendly; striking up
acquaintances that may last from year to year is one of the best parts
of resort life.</p>
<p>Describe what you're looking for, and ask whether the owners think
you'd be comfortable at their resort. If a certain resort isn't for
you, nearly every owner will tell you so.</p>
<p>Don't hold back; chat away.</p>
<p>&quot;We want people to be happy when they're here,&quot; Fay says. &quot;That just
makes our job easier.&quot;</p>
<h3>When to reserve</h3>
<p>You can always find a place at a good resort, even at the last minute.</p>
<p>But if you're looking for a cabin at a small, traditional lake resort,
try to reserve up to a year in advance. At the best resorts, nearly
every family reserves their cabin for the following year before they
leave.</p>
<p>That means only a few are available. So the best time to reserve a cabin
is the Monday after the week you want to go the following year.</p>
<p>If you'd like to bring your extended family, and you need more than one
cabin, try to reserve at least <em>two</em> years in advance. For more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/groups/family-reunions-planning/">Planning a family
reunion</a>.</p>
