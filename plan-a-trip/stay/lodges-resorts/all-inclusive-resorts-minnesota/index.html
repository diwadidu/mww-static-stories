<p>In Minnesota, it's devilishly hard to find the lake resort that's right
for you.</p>
<p>Everyone wants the &quot;best&quot; resort. But asking the state tourism folks to
tell you which one is best is like asking a baker to pick out his best
pastry: They're all, of course, the best.</p>
<p>You can't ask your friends. They can tell you only which resort they go
to, and that one may be too luxurious/too rustic or not kid-friendly/too
family-oriented for you.</p>
<p>Finding your family's lakeside soul mate — that resort to which you'll
return year after year, that your children will think is the best place
in the world — is hard work.</p>
<p>It's not unlike dating; the right one is out there, but only you can
find it.</p>
<p>For a detailed how-to guide to choosing a lake resort, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/choosing-lake-resort/">One in
1,000</a>.</p>
<p>But the first thing you have to do is narrow your search and decide
<em>where</em> you want to vacation. Each lakes
region has the basics - fishing, golf, shopping — and is near bike
trails and casinos. Beyond that, each is geared to a different kind of
vacationer.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The best-known area in Minnesota is the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/water-sports/brainerd-minnesota-summer/">Brainerd
Lakes</a>. Its grand lodges always have
drawn prominent guests: gangsters, governors, business tycoons and now
golfers, who come for its brand-name courses. It has the state's largest
resorts, with services that appeal to affluent guests.</p>
<p>This is where the yachts and speedboats play, and if you don't like the
buzz of personal watercraft, try to find a quiet resort on a small lake.</p>
<p>There still are a few mom-and-pop resorts, and the busy village of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/nisswa-turtle-races/">Nisswa</a>
has old-fashioned souvenir shops and turtle races. Bicyclists can hop
onto the Paul Bunyan State Trail and ride all the way through Walker to
Bemidji.</p>
<p>Just to the north, the <em>Whitefish Chain</em> feels tucked away but is quite
affluent and very popular with boaters.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/park-rapids-minnesota-resorts/">Park Rapids</a> is the gateway to Itasca
State Park and the western trailhead of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/heartland-trail-towns/">Heartland State
Trail</a>, which connects with
the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/paul-bunyan-trail/">Paul Bunyan</a> in Minnesota's
longest trail system.</p>
<p>It's an old-fashioned resort town with plenty of shopping and a very
nice variety of family resorts on medium-size lakes.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stouts_lodge_boy_ball.jpg" alt="Playing ball on the lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Kids love spending lazy days on the lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the other end of the Heartland Trail,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/walker-leech-lake/">Walker</a>
is on the shores of Leech
Lake, the state's third-largest lake. It's a longtime fishing
stronghold, and the downtown is full of galleries and boutiques. Lately,
it's become a fine-dining destination.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/bemidji-bunyan-minnesota/">Bemidji</a>, a college town, is just north of Itasca State Park and has a nice mix
of resorts. There's a lot to do, so if you're not sure how much peace
and serenity you want, this is a good destination.</p>
<p>In town, there's a professional summer theater, good restaurants and
shops. Right on Lake Bemidji, there are resorts, a golf course, a state
park with an excellent naturalist program and the northern trailhead of
the Paul Bunyan State Trail.</p>
<p>The famous statues of Paul Bunyan and Babe, which started the
giant-mascot fad in 1937, are in the town and still a required photo
stop.</p>
<p>The <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/grand-rapids-minnesota/">Grand
Rapids</a>
area is known for serious fishing and moderate-priced family resorts and
is the western trailhead for the challenging Mesabi Trail. The
attractions of the Iron Range are just to the east.</p>
<p>Just south of the Canadian border, the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/voyageurs-park-boating/">Voyageurs National
Park</a> area
has lots of water begging to be explored by motorboat, tour boat,
houseboat or canoe. Tourists who don't have their own boats can hop onto
one of the national park's tour boats for a narrated excursion.</p>
<p>To the west, Lake of the Woods is renowned for fishing. To the east,
<a href="http://www.lakevermilionresorts.com/">Lake Vermilion</a> sometimes is
called the Lake Minnetonka of the North, for its 1,200-mile shoreline
and many bays, but also because it has heavy boat traffic and includes
the estates of many wealthy people.</p>
<p>It's also the home of the new <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/lake_vermilion_soudan/index.html">Lake Vermilion-Soudan Underground Mine
State
Park</a>. It has a variety of resorts and would make a good base for people who
want to visit both the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/orr-bear-sanctuary-minnesota/">bear sanctuary in
Orr</a> and
the wolf and bear centers in Ely.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-ely-minnesota-summer/">Ely</a>
is a magnet for canoeists, being near the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boundary-waters-tips/">Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness</a>, and guests at some
resorts can paddle right into the wilderness.</p>
<p>It's also the home of the International Wolf Center and <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/ely-bear-center/">North American
Bear Center</a> and has
fine galleries and restaurants.</p>
<p>To the east, but linked only by obscure forest roads, the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/gunflint-trail/">Gunflint
Trail</a> is the other big
jumping-off spot for the Boundary Waters. It's lined with luxury and
traditional resorts from which guests can take day trips into the BWCA.</p>
<p>It doesn't have a town, a golf course or a bike trail, but if you really
want to get away, and maybe see a moose, this is the place to go.</p>
<p>The <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/north-shore-lodgings/">North Shore</a>
begins at the east end of the Gunflint Trail and has been Minnesota's
favorite vacation spot since 1924, when the highway was built.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/cable_dock.jpg" alt="Sitting on a dock at a lake resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
There's no better view than the one from the end of a dock.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's problematic as a place for a family lake vacation — you can't swim
in the lake, and parents have to watch small children like a hawk on the
rocky shoreline — but it has lots of good places to stay and the best
hiking and scenery in the state.</p>
<p>The area around <a href="http://www.millelacs.com/">Mille Lacs</a> is a fishing
haven with traditional resorts.</p>
<p>Just to the west, the <a href="https://midwestweekends.com/plan_a_trip/shopping_eating/antiques/cuyuna_lakes_minnesota.html">Cuyuna
Lakes</a>
area has paddling, fishing and mountain biking around the lovely
mine-pit lakes of Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area, which some call
a miniature Boundary Waters. Its main town, Crosby, is known for its
antiques stores.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/alexandria-minnesota/">Alexandria</a>, right off I-94,
is the big resort area that's closest to the Twin Cities. It's known
for golf, speedboats and NASCAR races, and it has a variety of resorts
on outlying lakes.</p>
<p>You won't see a lot of pine trees here on the edge of the prairie, but
it has a professional summer theater, and it's on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/central-lakes-trail/">Central Lakes
Trail</a>, part of a bicycle-trail
system that stretches from Fergus Falls nearly to St. Cloud.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/otter-trails/">Otter Tail County</a> is
just to the north and has more lakes and more giant roadside mascots
than any other county in Minnesota. Along with Detroit Lakes, it's
known for small, traditional resorts and a rolling forest-meets-prairie
terrain that lends itself to bird-watching.</p>
<p>The closest lakes region by distance is the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/little-crow-lakes-minnesota/">Kandiyohi
lakes</a> region around Spicer. It
has traditional resorts and also county-run lake campgrounds that are
much like resorts.</p>
<p>Don't miss the Friday-night performances of the Little Crow Water Ski
Team in New London, which feel like a blast from the past.</p>
<h3>More lake resorts</h3>
<p>If you're still looking, go to <a href="http://www.exploreminnesota.com/places-to-stay/resorts/index.aspx">Explore Minnesota's resort
directory</a>, which shows more than 750 resorts if you check the box for &quot;on a lake
or river,&quot; and more than 550 if you also filter for &quot;swimming
beach.&quot;</p>
<p>You also can type in an area if you have one in mind. For example, if
you also type in &quot;Park Rapids&quot; and &quot;within 25 miles,&quot; you'll
get 50 resorts.</p>
<p>You also can choose from a menu of amenities you'd like the resort to
have, including &quot;pets allowed.&quot;</p>
