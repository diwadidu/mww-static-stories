<h2>For more than 130 years, this beloved resort has been drawing guests to the North Shore.</h2>

<p>When people have been beating a path to your door for more than 130
years, you're probably doing something right.</p>
<p>Swedish immigrants C.A.A. and Anna Nelson were accidental hosts in 1886,
when they began putting up travelers in their new home at the mouth of
the Poplar River, chosen because it was C.A.A.'s favorite fishing spot.</p>
<p>More people came, and their Lutzen House became Lutsen Resort. Their
children and grandchildren added a gabled lodge, ski hill, pool and
townhomes. Then came log cabins, luxury condos, a golf course, a gourmet
chef and a spa.</p>
<p>Yet it's hard to improve on what nature put on Lutsen's doorstep: a
pebble beach, the rushing river and the vast expanses of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess they have to keep doing new things, but for us, they don't have
to do a thing,&quot; says Mike Bailey of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>I met Bailey and his wife, Marji, as we all stood at the check-in
counter on a warm evening in May.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They made a beeline for the beach with a bottle of wine and ingredients
for s'mores, and later I joined them and two grandchildren around a
bonfire. They were so happy to be there they were almost giddy.</p>
<p>&quot;The first thing we do is ask to have a fire made for us,&quot; Mike Bailey
said. &quot;Once we came in April and didn't get here till midnight, but we
still went down to the beach, sat in chairs and looked at the stars.&quot;</p>
<p>I felt giddy myself after crossing the covered bridge over the Poplar
and walking the trails along the rocky shoreline, breathing in that
north-woods perfume of inland sea, pine needles and cedar bark.</p>
<p>It's aromatherapy for city folks, and it made me think I should come up
more.</p>
<p>To the North Shore in general, but in particular to Lutsen and its
ultra-cozy 1952 pine lodge. We'd stopped by on a 20-below Sunday evening
that January, when a happy wedding party filled its glowing, window-lined
restaurant, so we'd simply looked in wistfully and moved on.</p>
<p>The first time I went into the lodge was on a chilly autumn evening in
1981, when a fire was crackling in the fieldstone fireplace, flanked by
picture windows.</p>

flows into Lake Superior.

<p>We fetched a beer from the pub, walking past the glass-enclosed polar
bear bagged by C.A.A. and Anna's son George Sr. on a trip to Alaska and
admiring photos of George Jr.'s daughter Cindy, a world-class skier who
won a bronze at the 1976 Olympics and several World Cup races.</p>
<p>Then we sank into overstuffed leather chairs before the fire and drank
our beers. And I thought: This is the best place in Minnesota.</p>
<p>No amount of money
nor all the interior designers in the world can replicate the patina of
well-used pine and polished leather and the easygoing atmosphere.</p>
<p>And then there's the biggest draw of all, the big lake.</p>
<p>That night, I cracked my window so I could hear the lapping of the
waves. When I awoke at 2:15 a.m., the Baileys were still on the beach,
feeding their fire and looking at stars.</p>
<p>A lot of people love the smaller rooms of the lodge, set along
pine-paneled halls. But in the 21st century, even more want king beds,
big bathrooms and hot tubs.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;It's a hard balance,&quot; says Diane Loh, former general manager and
grandniece of Inga Toftey, who married George Sr. &quot;Before we built the
Poplar River condos, we were really the old guy on the block.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to keep the feel of the place and not get too modern,&quot; she
says. &quot;And yet, we have to have everything that guests want.&quot;</p>
<p>Loh is now retired; her last big project was supervising construction of
the elegant Cliff House Townhomes on the hill above the lodge.</p>
<p>In 2018, Nancy Burns and Scott Harrison, who had bought the resort from
George Nelson Jr. and ran it for 30 years, sold the resort to Manitoban
Bryce Campbell and his mother Sheila Campbell, who also own a historic
inn in Fort Frances, Ont.</p>
<p>The next morning of my stay, the dining room was filled with longtime
guests. Bud and Barb Rinke of Nisswa, Minn., had been coming once or
twice a year for the last 50 years.</p>
<p>They first stayed in the lodge on their honeymoon, when they drove
around Lake Superior, and liked it so much they stayed there on the way
back, too.</p>
<p>&quot;We've probably stayed in every room, and we've worked our way up to
112,&quot; Barb said. &quot;That's the corner room, but not the one over the
restaurant.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_restaurant.jpg" alt="The restaurant at Lutsen lodge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;We just love the lake and the water and the serenity,&quot; Bud said.
&quot;A lot of people wouldn't like this lodge, because the bathrooms are
small, but that doesn't bother us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, we like it; there's some sort of stability in it,&quot; Barb said.</p>
<p>They had been talking with server Jackie Dillen Beck as if they'd known
her for years, but Bud said they'd just met her. She's typical of the
unpretentious staff and management, he said, which is another reason
they keep coming back.</p>
<p>&quot;If people will take the time to exchange banter with you, someone is
doing a good job,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dillen Beck didn't mind at all.</p>
<p>&quot;So many interesting people come here,&quot; she said. &quot;For so many,
this is a second home. This is the place they can come back to.&quot;</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Lutsen Resort</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  There isn't really a town of Lutsen. The name comes
from C.A.A. Nelson's application for a post office in 1890.</p>
<p>He submitted the name Poplar, which already had been taken, so he named
it after the 1632 Battle of Lutzen, in which Sweden's King Gustavus
Adolphus was killed.</p>
<p>The town &quot;center&quot; is the hardware store, small grocery and other stores
around the post office. It's seven miles east of Tofte and 20 miles west
of Grand Marais.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The resort has had issues with staffing. Check recent
reviews before going.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodations:</strong>  Prices are highest on
peak ski and fall-color weekends and in July and August. Look for deals
in the spring and late-fall shoulder seasons and check for packages.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lutsenresort.com/lodging/lutsen-lodge/">lodge</a> has
comfortably furnished, smallish rooms, many with lake views. Rooms do
not have mini-fridges, and some people consider them a little rundown.
There's an adjoining pool/whirlpool/sauna complex.</p>
<p>On the hill south of the lodge, next to the nine-hole golf course and
The WatersMeet Spa, it rents the luxuriously furnished <a href="https://www.lutsenresort.com/lodging/cliff-house-townhomes/">Cliff House
Townhomes</a>, with gas fireplaces, decks, views and whirlpool rooms.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_townhomes.jpg" alt="Cliff House Townhomes at Lutsen." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The luxurious Cliff House Townhomes are the newest addition to the
resort.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The two-bedroom <a href="https://www.lutsenresort.com/lodging/log-cabins/">Log
Cabins</a> have
wood-burning stoves and decks and are next door on the bluff,
overlooking Lake Superior. It's an easy walk down the hill to the lodge
and pool complex.</p>
<p>The resort no longer operates the Poplar River condos or Sea Villas townhomes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lutsenresort.com/Dining"><strong>Dining</strong></a>: The restaurant now
is quite expensive; check before you go so you're not unpleasantly
surprised.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.lutsenresort.com/activities/">Activities</a>:</strong>  Activities
directors give free kayaking lessons/tours, fly-fishing classes and
guided hiking and skiing excursions and provide shuttles for guests who
want to go off on their own. There's free golf on the resort's
nine-hole course.</p>
<p>The WatersMeet Spa and Wellness Center is just up the hill. The highly
rated 27-hole <a href="http://www.superiornational.com/golf/proto/superiornational/">Superior
National</a>
golf course is across the highway on the mountain, with views of the
lake.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.lutsen.com">Lutsen Mountains</a>:</em> The Nelson family sold the
ski resort in 1980. It's just up the hill from the resort.</p>
