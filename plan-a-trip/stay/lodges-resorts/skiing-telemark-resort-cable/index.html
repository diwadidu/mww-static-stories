<h2>For years, a legendary ski resort in northwest Wisconsin tried to claw its way back.</h2>

<p>What becomes a legend most? In the case of Telemark Resort in northwest
Wisconsin, a new life without the old lodge.</p>
<p>The once-busy ski lodge closed in 1998, reopened in 1999, closed again
in 2010 and reopened in January 2011. It closed once more in 2013 and
was sold at auction.</p>
<p>The new owners never had the money to revitalize the property and, in
2017, planned to sell it to a hotel-management company that would
modernize and reopen the resort as a year-round vacation destination.
That deal soon fell apart.</p>
<p>In 2020, the lodge's contents were auctioned off. In 2021, the American
Birkebeiner Ski Foundation acquired the property and demolished the
lodge.</p>
<p>It plans to develop the 713-acre property into an outdoor-recreation
hub, with event space and even more trails for skiing, biking and
hiking.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>While the concrete lodge had precious little polish, the snow-kissed
location has plenty of luster. The 50-kilometer Birkie Trail is out the
door, the lovely Rock Lake Trail is down the road and Chequamegon
National Forest rolls for miles to the north and west, studded with
lakes and waterfalls.</p>
<p>People loved Telemark, started in 1947 by the legendary <a href="https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS16474">Tony
Wise</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;So many people have history with it,&quot; says local resident Susan
Fibert. &quot;They say, 'I learned to ski there,' or 'I met my wife
there.' Telemark is the place you absolutely know.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the spiritual home of cross-country skiers, especially those who
were there in the sport's infancy.</p>
<p>&quot;I was really emotional when it closed,&quot; said Phil Van Valkenberg,
who has skied 30 Birkies and three Kortelopets and was Telemark's
marketing director for four years after it reopened in 1999. &quot;I've
spent half my life there. It was the end of Tony's dream and the end of
my dream.&quot;</p>

<p>Tony Wise was the visionary who made northwest Wisconsin a sports mecca.
Born in the depressed logging town of Hayward, he wanted to find a way
to revive his hometown.</p>
<p>After the Second World War, he was stationed in alpine Bavaria, and
there he found inspiration in the surrounding ski resorts.</p>
<p>Back in Wisconsin, Wise picked a likely hill and opened Mount Telemark.
It drew alpine skiers from all over the Midwest, and in 1972, Wise built
a grand lodge, with 200 rooms, pools, a theater and ballrooms in which
national entertainers performed.</p>
<p>He also added cross-country trails. His 50-kilometer American
Birkebeiner, started in 1973, became the largest and best-known ski race
in North America, drawing elite athletes from all over the world as well
as thousands of recreational skiers.</p>
<p>But while he was putting Hayward and Cable on the map, Tony Wise was
going broke. His vision was too grand for this little hill, far from the
big cities, and the Rockies were taking his alpine skiers away.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He lost Telemark and died in 1995. When the resort reopened the first
time, it kept only a small tubing and snowboarding hill, in addition to
its cross-country system.</p>
<p>Its new owners were the people who owned time-share intervals at its
condos and villas, and many were die-hard Birkie skiers.</p>
<p>It was part of Tony Wise's genius that, at a time when cross-country
skiing still was in its infancy in this country, he appropriated the
Birkebeiner glory — a glory that, when marathon skiers finish, they
feel they've earned for themselves.</p>
<p>He put references to the legend all around the lodge, where a massive
bronze relief of a 13th-century Norwegian warrior hung over the 55-foot
fieldstone fireplace.</p>
<p>The story is that, during a civil war in 1206, royal partisans rescued
the infant grandson of the late King Sverre from enemy territory, skiing
55 kilometers to safety.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The warriors were members of a political faction called Birkebeiners,
named because they once were so poor that, when their trousers wore out,
they tied pieces of birch bark around their legs.</p>
<p>The rescue is commemorated today in Norway with a race between
Lillehammer and Rena, in which competitors ski with a pack that weighs
12 pounds, like the little prince, who became King Haakon IV.</p>
<h3>A weekend at Telemark</h3>
<p>My friend Adele, with whom I visited Telemark after it reopened the
first time, loved the romantic story.</p>
<p>&quot;I never understood the mystique behind the Birkebeiner before,&quot; she
said. &quot;I knew it was a big deal, but this gives me a much better sense
of what it's about.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as we got to the resort, we headed out along the 6-kilometer
John Bauer Trail. It was unusually challenging for an intermediate
trail, but the forest was gorgeous that day, with white-pine needles
creating a pixillated effect against crisp blue sky.</p>
<p>After a couple of rides down the tubing hill, we went to soothe our
muscles in the hot tub, where we talked to a Birkie skier from Madison.</p>
<p>&quot;They could do so much with this place,&quot; she said. &quot;The trails are
great. And the tubing is so much fun; it made me feel like a kid
again.&quot;</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>After we left the next morning, we drove six miles down the road to the
Forest Service's Rock Lake Trail system, where we skied a lovely
4-kilometer loop that rose and fell through thick forest.</p>
<p>In the summer, the Rock Lake Trail is one of the most notorious parts of
the CAMBA <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/mountain-biking-cable-hayward/">mountain-biking
trails</a>, more than 300 miles of marked and mapped routes through forest.</p>
<p>Tony Wise had a hand in that, too; in 1983, he helped start the
Chequamegon Fat Tire Festival, which became the largest mountain-biking
event of its kind. Today, the CAMBA routes often are included on
national lists of best trails.</p>
<p>There's snowshoeing and hiking on the North Country National Scenic
Trail; one of its premier segments is the six-mile Porcupine Lake hike
between Cable and Drummond.</p>
<p>There's paddling on Lake Namekagon and the Namekagon River and
world-famous musky fishing in the flowages and lakes.</p>
<p>The area has one of the region's best displays of fall color, and in
autumn, motorists come to drive the three mapped routes.</p>
<p>It was the endless slate of things to do that had prompted former
marketing director Van Valkenberg to promote Telemark as the &quot;Outdoor
Adventure Base.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the Ritz,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;But it sure is a good
base for having fun.&quot;</p>
