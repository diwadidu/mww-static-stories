<h2>At Stout's Lodge in western Wisconsin, guests gain entree into a less hurried era.</h2>

Frank Stout poured $1.5 million in 1915 dollars into his family's
beloved retreat.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At the turn of the last century, as Wisconsin's pineries were vanishing
into sawmills, the vast fortunes they produced fell to the heirs of the
Knapp, Stout lumber company.</p>
<p>Operating in the Red Cedar River valley, it was for a time the largest
in the world, and Menomonie was the company town. The heirs gave it
schools, churches, an auditorium; James Stout, son of the president,
endowed the institute that became the University of Wisconsin-Stout.</p>
<p>His brother Frank found a different use for his money. He plowed $1.5
million in 1915 money into a 26-acre island estate near the town of Rice
Lake, on Red Cedar Lake.</p>
<p>With trainloads of cedar logs from Idaho, redwood from California and
white pine from local dams, he built his family a rambling,
35,000-square-foot compound, adorned by Bavarian carvings of pelicans
and oak leaves, Gothic arches and medieval-Norwegian dragon's heads.</p>
<p>This Island of Happy Days was &quot;the dearest place on Earth,&quot; said
Frank Stout. Photographs show him playing there with his wife, Clara,
and their five children: picnicking, trap shooting, water skiing on
planks.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In one photo, Frank is going down a slide; in another, the family is
costumed, and Frank, then 57, wears a parasol, apron and headdress.</p>
<p>But in 1927, Frank died. Clara continued to use the estate until she
died there in 1948. After that, the lodge deteriorated until it was
purchased and opened to overnight guests in 1992.</p>
<p>Today, at Stout's Island Lodge, anyone can tread in the steps of the
tycoon. The butlers, maids, cooks and gardeners who tended the tycoon,
however, are gone, so guests are left to wander around the island on
their own.</p>
<p>The handsome log lodge sits on a hillock, its doors flanked by clumps of
pink mallow and opening onto a sloping lawn, on which someone usually is
playing croquet.</p>
<p>Beyond, through a fringe of greenery, wooden stairs lead to a screened
landing whose curving roof and carved rails bear the mark of Norwegian
builder Hans Haugen, who put the dragons on the downspouts. From there,
swimmers descend to the dock, off which a small raft is anchored.</p>
<p>There's a clay tennis court and an elegant boathouse, with a collection
of high-quality canoes, kayaks, water bikes and rowing shells.</p>

<p>When my friend Grace and I went there one July, three baby swallows were
in a nest in a shell and often could be seen hungrily flapping their
beaks.</p>
<p>On the narrow, wooded island next door, a pair of osprey tended their
nest atop a pine, and orioles, warblers and finches trill and whistle in
the bushes.</p>
<p>I took out a kayak to get a better view of the ospreys, a white-breasted
raptor that's smaller than an eagle but still a big bird. One was on the
nest as I paddled up; then the other flew up and took a post on the dead
branch next to it. Just ahead, a loon bobbed on the water.</p>
<p>We played some tennis, then went down to the swimming dock, where we
frittered away most of the afternoon.</p>
<p>Then we drifted over the footbridge onto the wooded island, where a path
strewn with pine needles leads to two Adirondack chairs overlooking the
lake. Sitting there, lulled by the hum of motorboats and the rustle of
leaves, Grace promptly fell asleep.</p>
<p>Before dinner, we leafed through the Stout family photo albums, and soon
we were able to attach names to the compelling faces in the framed
portraits we'd been gazing at in the dining room, including Allison,
the fair-haired youngest boy, and Harry, the handsome oldest son, who
died of appendicitis at 34.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The whole family was handsome, in fact. And they didn't seem to sit at
home much; one photo shows them on camels, in front of the Sphinx in
Egypt.</p>
<p>For many people, this kind of family glamour makes Stout's Island Lodge
irresistible.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a step back into the past, with all that implies,&quot; said
Curlin Sullivan, who had  traveled from Atlanta to join her husband's
family reunion. &quot;When you walk in the door, the feeling is incredible.
If you're quiet and still enough, you can almost imagine it's yours.&quot;</p>
<p>Other families had convened at Stout's, including that of Dottie
&quot;Boomer&quot; Joseph of Sarasota, Fla., who had come to celebrate her 80th
birthday. Usually, the clan could be found playing croquet or sitting on
the lawn's circle of Adirondack chairs.</p>
<p>&quot;There are all kinds of things to do for all ages, or you don't have
to do anything,&quot; Joseph said. &quot;I even rode a water bicycle for the
first time.&quot;</p>
<p>It took a while for us to get off the island, because the pontoon boat
needed a new fuse. But we were in no hurry, because the island had
caught us in its languorous embrace.</p>
