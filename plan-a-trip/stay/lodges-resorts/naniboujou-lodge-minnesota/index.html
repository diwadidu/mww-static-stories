<h2>On Minnesota's North Shore, a Jazz Age lodge still inspires reverence.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/a/naniboujou_winter.jpg" alt="Naniboujou Lodge is a landmark on the North Shore." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The historic lodge makes a cozy base on winter weekends.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>During the heady days of the Roaring Twenties, a group of Duluth
businessmen conceived a plan.</p>
<p>They would buy 3,300 acres of land along Lake Superior and on both sides
of the Arrowhead River, encompassing beach, waterfalls and rocky gorges.
They'd buy another 8,000 acres inland, where caribou still roamed and
lakes were thick with fish and fowl.</p>
<p>They'd build a clubhouse, with tennis courts and golf course and
swimming pool. And they'd name the whole thing for Naniboujou, the
powerful but benevolent Ojibwe spirit who claimed this northern
wilderness as his own.</p>
<p>&quot;If Naniboujou is your guide,&quot; they wrote in the prospectus, &quot;it is a
smooth path through majestic groves, between rocky walls, over mossy
ledges, through clumps of spruce that moose have nibbled . . . and to
mysteries known only to those who belong.&quot;</p>
<p>There would be every comfort, and yet &quot;simplicity and the charms of
outdoor life must prevail.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a grand plan, with sketches of a grand complex that looked much
like an English boys' school.</p>
<p>&quot;Your club sounds too good to resist and I will recommend it to a few
sensible friends as soon as I find out how to pronounce it,&quot; wrote New
York humorist and author Ring Lardner, who became a member of the board
of governors.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Boxer Jack Dempsey signed on, and baseball great Babe Ruth. Ground was broken in July 1928,
and the main clubhouse opened to great fanfare in July 1929. Then came
the October stock-market crash, followed by the Great Depression, and
the grand plan fell to ruins.</p>
<p>The land around the boiling rapids of the Arrowhead, now the Brule,
became Judge C.R. Magney State Park. Naniboujou's lodge was sold and
run as a resort, advertising &quot;No Hay Fever&quot; and $1.50 dinners. For a
while, it sat empty.</p>
<p>In 1963, Luther and Susie Wallace of Denver bought the property. They
considered the Christian God its patron spirit, not the Ojibwe's
Naniboujou, but they too were careful stewards.</p>
<p>&quot;This place lends itself to a Christian atmosphere, and I'd like to
preserve that,&quot; Luther Wallace said in an August 1977 interview. &quot;We
don't attract the type of folk turned on by plastic environments.&quot;</p>
<p>A month later, the Luthers' two grown sons drowned in the rain-swollen
Brule, and the property passed to a campus Christian association and
then, in 1980, to Nancy and Tim Ramey.</p>

<p>Under the Rameys, the lodge has acquired a modest elegance and a
reputation for good food that has earned it many repeat guests. But
they, too, have had to struggle with tragedy — in 1998, a brick
chimney collapsed on Tim Ramey, a volunteer firefighter, as he was
leaving the site of a house fire in Hovland.</p>
<p>He is paralyzed from the chest down but still runs the lodge with Nancy
and help from their seven children.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a real test, but he doesn't quit,&quot; Nancy Ramey says.
&quot;The lodge has been a blessing.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, this Jazz Age landmark is suffused by serenity. Light glows from
paper sconces in the Great Hall, whose vivid Cree designs on walls and
ceiling make it the most striking interior space in the state.</p>
<p>A fire crackles in the 200-ton fireplace, on which fieldstones form a
sunburst pattern. Soft music plays as soft-spoken young people carry
plates of food to tables.</p>
<p>There are no tennis courts or greens outside the still-handsome lodge,
with its weathered cypress shakes and paned windows edged in red and
cream. There are two red Adirondack chairs, facing the expanse of lake,
and that's all.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;There's not a lot of action,&quot; Nancy Ramey says. &quot;People can come
and enjoy this creation, the natural world, and be near the lake. They
can listen to the birds. They can be still, and listen to their own
hearts and think.&quot;</p>
<p>In winter, the pace is especially slow, and the lodge is open to guests
only on weekend packages, with all meals included.</p>
<p>My friend Jean and I drove up one February, following a lake whose
pewter-gray expanses blended with the lighter horizon and wan shoreline.</p>
<p>&quot;Winter is really nice, when you look at it,&quot; Jean said. &quot;It's
like the colors in the back of the crayon box that you hardly ever
use.&quot;</p>
<p>Ten miles north of Grand Marais, we stopped for one of my favorite
hikes, along the narrow gorge of the Kadunce River.</p>
<p>Walking on the river itself, we clutched a 5-foot pole until Jean went
through the snow and we discovered the water was only a few inches
thick.</p>
<p>Then we allowed ourselves to really look around, at the formations on
the gorge walls and at the snow-crusted surface, an elfish landscape of
dainty chandeliers and icy tea lights strung under thick slabs of snow.
Below, rushing waters drummed and thumped.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen — it's like bongos,&quot; Jean said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/a/naniboujou_chairs.jpg" alt="Adirondack chairs at Naniboujou." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Many guests just want to watch the lake from the lodge's Adirondack
chairs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There was a gentler murmur in the Great Hall of Naniboujou, where
servers were bringing out plates of mixed greens, spinach lasagna and
Danish cream with blackberries. In our beds that night, we could hear
the unseen lake pounding outside our windows.</p>
<p>After breakfast the next morning — egg scramble, roasted potatoes,
warm blueberry muffins and fresh pineapple with raspberries — we
picked up our box lunches and drove to Grand Marais and 26 miles up the
Gunflint Trail to Bearskin Lodge.</p>
<p>The lodge and parking lot were crawling with skiers, all in search of
decent snow, but once we got onto the Central Gunflint's 70-kilometer
network of groomed trails, we barely passed anyone.</p>
<p>We returned to Naniboujou for dinner, then went back to Grand Marais to
listen to a folk group sing bluegrass and Irish ballads at the Gunflint
Tavern.</p>
<p>Back at the lodge, we settled into the solarium and read the lodge
scrapbook as other guests played cards and board games.</p>
<p>In winter, many guests are content to stay in the cozy embrace of the
lodge and rarely venture beyond nearby trails.</p>
<p>The next morning, we chatted with Michael and Margaret Ayers, who had
flown up from Fithian, Ill., for the weekend and were reserving for the
next year. They also come up each summer with their two young children,
they said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's so quiet, very peaceful and relaxing,&quot; Michael Ayers said.
&quot;There's no Internet access, no phones, no TV. We could go anywhere
with all the frequent-flier miles and perks we have, but we'd rather
come here.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Before we left, we walked across the highway to the state park and up
the Brule, climbing to the base of Lower Falls, covered by great heaps
of glazed snow. Farther up, at the Devil's Kettle, water throbbed
darkly under long ice draperies topped by minarets of snow.</p>
<p>This wild stretch, where half of the Brule cascades 50 feet into a pool
and half vanishes into a pothole, was to be the showpiece of the private
Naniboujou, whose prospectus described &quot;the brawling and babbling of
the stream.&quot;</p>
<p>The original sketches adorn the lodge's walls, and Ramey doesn't deny
the glamour of Naniboujou's early history. But, she says, that was
then.</p>
<p>&quot;Those men had a dream, and that dream died,&quot; Ramey says. &quot;I guess I
feel there's a new dream. It's been resurrected, and I think it's
even better.&quot;</p>
<p>In principle, however, she and the founders are not so far apart.</p>
<p>&quot;The main business at Naniboujou is living,&quot; they wrote. &quot;To breathe
the air and eat and sleep and be glad.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Naniboujou Lodge in northeast Minnesota</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  It's five hours north of the Twin Cities. For similar

The lodge drew motor tourists in the 1930s.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then it's open only weekends through mid-March. Cost depends on which
room is chosen (the least expensive rooms may be too small and
thin-walled for some).</p>
<p>During the holidays, the Great Hall is decorated, and two of the dinners
are five-course affairs accompanied by Christmas carolers.</p>
<p>The lodge opens for summer in mid-May. Reserve at 218-387-2688. For fall
weekends, reserve as far in advance as possible.</p>
<p><em>Hiking:</em>  There are three good places to hike between Grand Marais and
Naniboujou: along the canyon of the Devil Track River, five miles north
of Grand Marais off County Highway 58; along the Kadunce, 10 miles
north; and along the Brule in Judge C.R. Magney State Park, right across
the highway.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">Hiking the North
