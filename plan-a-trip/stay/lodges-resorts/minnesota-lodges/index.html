<h2>The passage of time burnishes the appeal of historic lake resorts.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/a/naniboujou_winter.jpg" alt="Naniboujou Lodge is a landmark on the North Shore." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Lake Superior, Naniboujou was conceived in the high-flying 1920s but
today is a quiet retreat.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Ever since there's been a Minnesota, people have wanted to see its
abundant waters.</p>
<p>The first curious tourists came up the Mississippi in the 1820s with the
first steamboats, to see St. Anthony Falls and nearby tepees and to dine
on buffalo, elk and sturgeon.</p>
<p>By the 1850s, city folk in the East already were pining for the
unspoiled wilderness; one of them, Israel Garrard, was on a hunting trip
from his home near Cincinnati when he saw a point on Lake Pepin, a
widening in the Mississippi, and settled there.</p>
<p>In 1865, he opened the Lake Side Hotel, and Frontenac became
Minnesota's first resort.</p>
<p>The next resorts opened in agricultural western Minnesota — Alexandria
and Detroit, now Detroit Lakes. Rail tycoons and local developers worked
together, and the same trains that shipped out grain in the 1880s
brought in tourists.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It wasn't until the late 1890s that resorts came to the north woods.
Loggers had left rail lines and hotels, and fishermen streamed onto the
lakes from denuded shores.</p>
<p>Near Mille Lacs, on Bay Lake, Joe and Josie Ruttger opened a fishing
resort in 1898, and made their first expansion in 1901.</p>
<p>In the new Itasca State Park, logging still was going on when Douglas
Lodge was built in 1905, &quot;a jewel standing in mud.&quot;</p>
<p>Along with log cabins and the 1910 Club House, it's still owned and
operated by the state of Minnesota (for more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/classic-cabins/minnesota-state-park-cabins/">Lodgings in Minnesota
state parks</a> ).</p>
<p>These and other resorts flourished. By then, Minnesota already had
latched onto the Lake Wobegon concept of tourism: According to state
brochures, its air was purer, its lakes bluer and its fish all above
average.</p>
<p>Tourists bought it and came from all over — windswept North Dakota,
the dry prairies of Kansas and Oklahoma, the humid South.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_douglas_lodge.jpg" alt="Douglas Lodge at Itasca State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Itasca State Park, the Douglas Lodge has been housing tourists since
1905.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>After World War I, resorts sprouted everywhere, from 200 in 1917 to
nearly 1,300 by 1930. In their new automobiles, on newly built roads,
families could go everywhere — and they did.</p>
<p>These were the golden days for resorts. During the 1920s, log-cabin
architecture became popular, and the look — massive beams, fieldstone
fireplaces, boulder foundations - became synonymous with the north
woods.</p>
<p>The classic, leisurely &quot;at the lake&quot; vacation was born.</p>
<p>The lake tradition is alive and well today, but the traditional resort
is harder to find (for help, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/all-inclusive-resorts-minnesota/">The resort of your
dreams</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/choosing-lake-resort/">One in 1,000</a> ).</p>
<p>Rising expectations have forced larger resorts to bustle like cruise
ships.</p>
<p>Rising lakeshore values have caused many smaller resorts to be torn
down, sometimes to provide space for just one oversized &quot;cabin.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Times have changed. There are still a few resorts, however, that
maintain an air of old-fashioned gentility, from the days when Texas oil
millionaires brought their maids and butlers.</p>
<p>Others still cater to people who just want to sit and look at the lake.
Others have magnificent façades barely noticed by guests hurrying to
make a tee time.</p>
<p>But each has a history, and none can be duplicated.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Classic Minnesota lodges</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/lodging/units_rooms.html">Douglas
Lodge</a>
in Itasca State Park</strong> : This lodge, built
in 1905, is saturated with the history of Itasca State Park,
Minnesota's oldest and most-loved park.</p>
<p>From its steps, guests can set off for nature hikes, boat trips or
bicycle treks through the state's largest stand of virgin white pine or
to the headwaters of the Mississippi, at the other end of Lake Itasca.</p>
<p>Its four rooms and three suites are quite attractive; the lodge includes
a restaurant.

<p><strong><a href="http://www.clearwateroutfitters.com/">Clearwater Lodge</a> on the

are in use.</p>
<p>Log cabins line the shore of Clearwater Lake, from which guests,
outfitted by the lodge, can explore the Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.burntside.com/">Burntside Lodge</a> outside Ely</strong> :
It started as a hunting camp after the
turn of the century and became a resort in 1913, making it the oldest
resort in the Ely area.</p>
<p>The resort's log lodge and cabins are painted burnt-orange, which
provides a striking contrast with the bright blue of lovely,
12-mile-long Burntside Lake and the 125 pine-covered islands.</p>
<p>Its charmingly old-fashioned restaurant is open to the public.</p>

Trail</strong> : This resort on the central
Gunflint has a rustic 1945 lodge with walls lined with old logging-camp

Lodge.</p>

wall and a bar with a sloping funhouse floor and color prints of &quot;the
girls,&quot; gauzy nudes from the 1930s or '40s.</p>
<p>It's popular with boaters, who pull up for a walleye sandwich or a
drink on the old-fashioned screened veranda. Lodgers stay in
old-fashioned hotel rooms or newer villas.</p>

This lodge, 15 miles northeast of Grand
Marais on the shore of Lake Superior, is one of a kind.</p>
<p>Opened in 1929 as an exclusive private club — Babe Ruth and Jack
Dempsey were among its charter members - it foundered after the

<p>But it's still gorgeous, with its weathered cypress shakes and red and
cream window frames. Inside, a fine restaurant occupies the Great Hall,
brilliantly painted with geometric Cree designs.</p>
<p>Quiet is the word here — there's a solarium for board games and
reading, and phones and televisions are absent in the simple but
attractive rooms.</p>

service in Bismarck's armies.</p>
<p>Joe and Josie Ruttger's great-grandson Chris now runs the full-service
resort, the state's oldest resort still operated by the same family.</p>
<p>The original 1901 cottage has been absorbed into the main lodge, which
