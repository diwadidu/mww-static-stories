<h2>On Minnesota's North Shore, a state-park guesthouse is a prized hideaway.</h2>

<p>In Minnesota's state parks, the goodies go way beyond hiking trails,
picnic sites and fishing piers.</p>
<p>Minnesota parks house their visitors, too, not only in campgrounds but
in suites and cabins and lodges and even a few split-level homes. Of
course, they're very popular.</p>
<p>But the most popular place of all is the Illgen Falls Cabin in
Tettegouche State Park, especially in summer.</p>
<p>For what could be better than having a 45-foot waterfall, spa and
swimming hole in the back yard, with entertainment from a corps of cliff
jumpers?</p>
<p>Take it from me: Nothing's better.</p>
<p>One July, as even people along the shore of ice-cold Lake Superior were
broiling in the heat, I was two miles inland, letting the cool water of
the Baptism River swirl past as I sat in a shoulder-high Jacuzzi of
volcanic rock as smoothly molded as an Eames chair.</p>
<p>Until the state bought it, this section of Baptism River shoreline,
including Illgen Falls, was private property.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When it became part of Tettegouche State Park, the state remodeled the
house into a two-bedroom handicapped-accessible cabin with a big deck,
gas grill, gas fireplace and kitchen with microwave, full
refrigerator-freezer, computerized oven and glass-ceramic range.</p>
<p>The cabin's best feature, however, is the river below, which flows over
and among a jumble of smooth rhyolite boulders and slabs, many bearing
potholes scoured out by glacial waters.</p>
<p>Then the river cascades 45 feet over a cliff, into a deep pool that's a
magnet for local young people.</p>
<p>They started showing up right after we got there, jumping into the pool
from the cliffs on either side of the falls, into the falls from rocks
above and even &quot;surfing&quot; down an algae-slickened boulder and into the
froth.</p>
<p>&quot;I've seen 50-year-old guys slide down backward,&quot; said one of the
jumpers, who grew up in Silver Bay and says he used to mow the lawn of
the house. &quot;Where it's foamy, it's soft. It's only dangerous when the
water's too high; it's so deep nobody knows how deep it is.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/e/tettegouche_illgen_cabin.jpg" alt="Illgen Falls cabin at Tettegouche." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Baptism River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the morning, we walked upriver to another spot he'd recommended, with
a quiet pool and a 8-foot-high pile of fractured rock, from which a man
and a boy already were jumping and diving.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a shelf under here, so you have to jump out, not down,&quot; said
the man, who grew up in Silver Bay and was showing the spot to his young
friend. &quot;I used to jump in the big falls, but I wore glasses then, so I
couldn't really see it.&quot;</p>
<p>Just upstream, we lounged on slabs and took turns letting the river bump
us down a rocky chute into the deliciously cool pool, where we swam, our
limbs appearing orange from the tannins in the river.</p>
<p>Down at the big falls, local teen-agers were congregating, many of them
wondering if we were the occupants of the house and would chew them out
for jumping.</p>
<p>&quot;The park rangers told us not to come here anymore, that there are
rocks,&quot; one Silver Bay girl said, &quot;but we've been coming here forever,
and we know there aren't rocks.&quot;</p>
<p>Watching them jump, each time bobbing straight to the surface, I was
nearly ready to jump myself when park ranger Curt Anderson came by and
splashed cold water on my plan.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;The current is really forceful,&quot; he said. &quot;There's a cave underneath
the falls, and the water goes both ways. It could push you out, it could
let you drop a ways, or it could pull you back under the wall; it all
depends on where you jump. There was a guy about 30 years ago who
jumped, and they still haven't found his body.</p>
<p>&quot;Or a log could come down the river and get caught underneath. The first
15 people could jump and be fine, and the next one could jump in just
the wrong place.&quot;</p>
<p>When he was growing up in Two Harbors, said Anderson, wiping sweat from
his face, he'd jump at Gooseberry Falls.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd like to jump myself on a day like this,&quot; he said. &quot;But now that I
know what the water does, I don't.&quot;</p>
<p>Illgen Falls isn't the highest in Tettegouche; that's 70-foot High
Falls, the highest in Minnesota if you don't count the 120-foot High
Falls of the Pigeon River, whose cascade along the Minnesota border is
shared with Ontario.</p>
<p>In Tettegouche, hiking trails lead to High Falls and Two Step Falls as
well as to four lakes, deep in a dense hardwood forest.</p>
<h3>Cabins on a lake</h3>
<p>One of them, Mic Mac Lake, is home to four other guest cabins, very
different from the Illgen Falls Cabin but almost as sought-after.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/e/tettegouche_swim_hole.jpg" alt="A swimming hole on the Baptism River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Upstream, a boy jumps off a smaller cliff into a swimming hole.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In 1910, the company that had logged the area sold its camp and property
on the shores of the lake to a group of Duluth businessmen, who called
themselves the Tettegouche Club after an Algonquin word meaning &quot;the
retreat.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, their rustic log cabins are available to overnight guests who
don't mind packing their food and bedding in and out over a steep,
1Â¾-mile gravel road.</p>
<p>When I was walking in, I met Mark Graham of Shoreview walking out with
his wife, Lynda, and three young daughters.</p>
<p>&quot;The hike in and out is the killer,&quot; he said. &quot;I offered the ranger
$30 for a ride up, and she said she wouldn't do it, she'd lose her
job.&quot;</p>
<p>Farther along, I met three Twin Cities women who had just finished their
fourth visit and had the packing routine down to a science. Once they
get there, they said, they stay.</p>
<p>&quot;We want to just enjoy the solitude of the area,&quot; said Ellen Held of
New Hope. &quot;It's not people-polluted.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The Mic Mac camp can be a little funky in summer â€” there were six
dead bats lying around the cool main lodge, where I had lunch at the
massive pine table â€” but the restored log cabins are fetching, with
little screened porches and window boxes full of geraniums; each comes
with a canoe.</p>
<p>More importantly, the retreat provides a rare look into the past, when
even those who could afford every luxury could think of nothing better
to have than a silent expanse of pristine water and wooded shoreline.</p>
<p>That's what I saw all around, as I stood at the end of the Mic Mac dock,
and it was beautiful.</p>
<p>&quot;It's truly one of those religious-type experiences, outside a church,&quot;
park manager Gary Hoeft says of the retreat.</p>
<p>People who want Minnesota state-park cabins and guesthouses for weekends
from May through October should reserve them on the first day they're
available, probably in the first hour. Competition is fierce.</p>
<p>But if you do get one of these places, you'll likely feel like the
luckiest person in Minnesota.</p>
