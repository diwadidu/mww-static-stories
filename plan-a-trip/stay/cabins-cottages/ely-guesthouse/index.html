<p>In Bear Head Lake State Park near Ely, there are three places to spend
the night: a tent, one of five rustic camper cabins and a modern
split-level.</p>
<p>On a subzero day in winter, one is better than the others.</p>
<p>Minnesota's state parks are sprinkled with <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/minnesota-state-park-cabins/">guesthouses and
cabins</a> that can be
rented. Some are marvelously atmospheric, such as the log cabins built
in Itasca for the tourist trade.</p>
<p>Others came with annexed land and the state remodeled them; in
Tettegouche, the Illgen Falls &quot;cabin&quot; is handicapped-accessible,
with a big deck, gas grill, gas fireplace and kitchen with microwave,
full refrigerator-freezer, computerized oven and glass-ceramic range.</p>
<p>The state isn't really in the hospitality business, so you take what
you get. There won't be chocolates on the pillow, but there might be a
wood-burning fireplace (Wild River) or kitchens stocked with
gourmet utensils (St. Croix).</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We rented the guesthouse in Bear Head State Park one Presidents Day
weekend. We were glad to have a warm, cozy haven, though it didn't have
a shred of atmosphere.</p>
<p>It was a classic suburban split-level with brownish nylon carpeting,
laminate furniture and linoleum, but it also had a roomy two-car garage.
There was a view of Bear Head Lake's North Bay from the deck and
walk-out patio, which must be nice in summer.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, I rooted through the kitchen drawers to see if I could
prove my theorem: Anything you <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/cabin-packing-list/">really need but don't
bring</a> is exactly what a
rented house won't have.</p>
<p>Bear Head Lake, I was pleased to see, had a small crockpot, three sets
of salt and pepper shakers and stacks of coffee filters. It also had 13
spatulas, four pitchers, three whisks, two toasters, a Bundt pan and a
turkey roaster.</p>
<p>But we hadn't come to the park to hang around the kitchen. There was
plenty of snow on the ground, but it had become crusty, and the ski
trails hadn't been groomed for three weeks. Ranger Jen Westlund advised
us to snowshoe or walk on the trails from the beach.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/ely_skier_norberg_red.jpg" alt="A skier in Ely." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>&quot;There are three deer who hang out there, and lately I've only seen
two, so maybe you'll find a dead deer and some wolf tracks,&quot; she
said with a smile. &quot;We see a lot of wolf tracks around here.&quot;</p>
<p>We were going to walk across the lake to the Becky Lake trail, but
instead we followed the East Bay on the Norberg Lake Trail, which was
lined with towering red and white pines and the occasional erratic
boulder, carried by glaciers.</p>
<p>We saw plenty of wolf tracks and some wolf scat, really just a compacted
twist of deer hair.</p>
<p>We were admiring a beautiful northwoods panorama of island, bay and lake
when seven women came skiing along, undeterred by the shallow tracks.</p>
<p>They were part of a group of 11 women on an annual cross-country ski
trip they've taken in various places since 1984, so we invited them to
look over our guesthouse, which sleeps 10 in three bedrooms.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;I love the view of the lake,&quot; said Janet Levine of Blaine, Minn.
&quot;And the kitchen is big enough.&quot;</p>
<p>LouAnn Nordwall of St. Paul tested the mattresses and pronounced them
comfortable; usually, she said, they bring air mattresses.</p>
<p>But then she noticed the small kitchen table, the only spot with enough
light for games and other activities.</p>
<p>&quot;What makes a cabin for 10 is the size of the kitchen table,&quot; she
said. &quot;To me, this is a cabin for six.&quot;</p>
<p>Lodges and large cabins are in huge demand for family reunions and
women's getaways; that weekend, Nordwall's group had found a cabin at
nearby Timber Wolf Lodge that had a long table and a kitchen with a
center island where the women could cook.</p>
<p>When the cost is split 11 ways, it's not much.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't need to spend a lot of money; you just have to get up
here,&quot; Nordwall said.</p>

<p>What all state-park guesthouses have is location, location, location.
People who want Minnesota state-park cabins and guesthouses for weekends
from May through October should reserve them on the first day they're
available, probably in the first hour.</p>
<p>Needless to say, competition is fierce.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Staying in <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/bear_head_lake/index.html">Bear Head Lake State Park</a> near Ely</h3>
<p><em>Details:</em>  The
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/bear_head_lake/guesthouse.html">guesthouse</a>
is near the park office, seven miles south of Minnesota 169 between Ely
and Tower. It has three bedrooms, one in the chilly lower level.</p>
<p>It has two full bathrooms and sleeps 10 on one full bed, four twins, two
sleeper sofas and a futon.</p>
<p>The living room is dim, so groups who want to play games should bring
extra lighting and, perhaps, a card table.</p>
<p>Beds have crinkly plastic covers, and there are only a few pillows; as
at other park cabins, you must bring your own pillows, bedding, towels
and soap, and clean the cabin before you leave.</p>
<p>The camper cabins are nearby, closer to the North Bay of Bear Head Lake.</p>
<p>For more about camper cabins, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/camper-cabins-midwest/">A roof in the
woods</a>.</p>
<p><em>Reservations:</em>  Reserve 120 days in advance
<a href="https://reservemn.usedirect.com/MinnesotaWeb/">online</a>
or at 866-857-2757. Reservation fee is $7-$10, and reservations can be
made starting at 8 a.m. (after the first day of availability, on-line
reservations can be made 24 hours a day).</p>
