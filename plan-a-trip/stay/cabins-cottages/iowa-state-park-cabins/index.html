<p>What a way to spend a weekend: hiking up and down ravines, clambering on
rock, admiring views of water from ridgelines.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like hiking on the North Shore,&quot; my husband said.</p>
<p>But it wasn't Lake Superior's North Shore. It was Iowa. And everyone
knows Iowa is one big, flat cornfield.</p>
<p>In the state's northeast corner, however, the Earth's surface bucks like
a rodeo pony. Glaciers missed the place where Iowa, Wisconsin and
Minnesota meet, and pillars of ancient bedrock poke out of hillsides
along sunken river valleys.</p>
<p>On the western edge of this Driftless Area, Backbone State Park lies in
a bowl carved by the Maquoketa River. Named for a knobby ridge called
the Devil's Backbone, it became Iowa's first state park in 1919.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, Civilian Conservation Corps crews created a serpentine
lake, built trails and used blocks of golden limestone to fashion
handsome beach and boat houses, an auditorium, rest rooms and pavilions.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They also built eight blufftop cabins that still are prized today; with
eight newer log cabins, they make Backbone more like a lake resort than
a state park.</p>
<p>We rented one of the CCC cabins for a weekend in May and saw we'd landed
one of the region's best deals.</p>
<p>For $50, we got a plain but cozy refuge with a modern bathroom, a
kitchen with full refrigerator and stove and a bedroom, though we chose
to sleep on the futon sofa in the living area.</p>
<p>The best part of the cabin was its location on the bluff above Backbone
Lake. We spotted a path in our back yard and followed it down a cleft
between mossy rock walls.</p>
<p>We emerged onto the East Lake Trail, a ribbon of crushed limestone that
was lined with spring wildflowers that obviously loved their cool, moist
home at the foot of the bluffs.</p>
<p>Nodding red-and-yellow columbines clung to rock crevices, and wild
ginger, Solomon's seal and jack in the pulpit grew in clumps. Wild
geranium grew in shafts of sunlight, and wild blue phlox lined the trail
whenever it left the shadow of the bluffs.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/backbone_torsten_path.jpg" alt="The East Lake Trail in Backbone State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>It was the Iowa fishing opener, but no one was on the lake. We saw the
most activity around a wooded peninsula, where frogs were in
full-throated chorus and a pair of fish vigorously thrashed in a tight
circle.</p>
<p>As we watched the flashing fins, a blue heron glided by.</p>
<p>&quot;This is like walking through our own little nature preserve,&quot; Torsten
said.</p>
<p>The East Lake Trail ended on the park road, and to our left, we saw the
Backbone Trail, which follows a ridge surrounded on three sides by the
Maquoketa River and Backbone Lake.</p>
<p>This is where the park got its nickname — black, pockmarked knobs of
rock erupt right out of the middle of the trail, looking just like
vertebrae on a spine.</p>
<p>It's also where the park looks least like Iowa. Twisted cedars grow out
of fissures, and we passed huge white pines and squeezed between
house-sized piles of limestone.</p>
<p>Groves of trout lilies grew in their shadow, and Virginia bluebells
carpeted the river flats. On the lake side, climbers descended limestone
cliffs.</p>
<p>The next day, we hiked the West Lake Trail, where the terrain pitches
and rolls like a dinghy in a storm.</p>
<p>There were rock outcroppings along the trail, which follows the lake
when it's not winding around a gully, but mostly it was open oak and
maple forest, with almost none of the brush and undergrowth found in the
northwoods.</p>
<p>It looked perfect for morel-hunting, and we looked, but we didn't find
anything. We had to be content spotting more spring ephemerals: spring
beauties, rue anemone, a few toothwort and Jacob's ladders and lots of
waving May apple, looking like fleets of tiny UFOs about to lift off.</p>
<p>All of the trails were well-tended, though we didn't see any park staff;
admission to Iowa parks is free, so there's no office at the entrances.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On Mother's Day, we saw more people in the north part of the park,
picnicking, playing games and fishing in the shallow river. The winding
park drive is very scenic, and we stopped to explore a cave in the
hillside.</p>
<p>The only other out-of-state license plates we saw all weekend were at
the deluxe log cabins, where two cars from Illinois were parked.</p>
<p>Apparently, people already have forgotten the famous line from the movie
&quot;Field of Dreams,&quot; which was filmed just 40 miles east of Backbone.</p>
<p>It applies to this picturesque little pocket, too: Is this heaven? No,
it's Iowa.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Backbone State Park cabins</h3>
<p><a href="http://iowastateparks.reserveamerica.com/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=IA&amp;parkId=610105&amp;topTabIndex=CampingSpot">Backbone State
Park</a>: The park is in northeast Iowa, an hour west of Dubuque and south of
the Minnesota border. It's three miles south of the town of Strawberry
Point.</p>
<p>The park rents 16 cabins, all on the east bluff overlooking Backbone
Lake. They're spread out, in clusters or four or two; the modern family
cabins are closest to the beach.</p>
<p>All have bathrooms, kitchens with pots and pans, a picnic table and a
fire ring. Guests must bring bedding, towels, soap and eating plates and
utensils, and they must clean the cabin before they leave. A $50
deposit check will be torn up if they have cleaned adequately.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/backbone_beach.jpg" alt="The beach at Backbone State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In the 1930s, Civilian Conservation Corps crews built Backbone's beach
and stone boathouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From Memorial Day to Labor Day, cabins rent only by the week, from
Friday to Friday. The rest of the year, they can be rented for a minimum
of two nights. Pets are allowed.</p>
<p>Eight one-bedroom <em>family cabins,</em>  $50 or $300 per week, sleep four
on a double bed and double futon sofa, and six are allowed.  They have
bathrooms and kitchens with pots and pans, full refrigerators and
stove/ovens.</p>
<p>They're heated but are open only from April through October.</p>
<p>Four two-bedroom, carpeted <em>modern family cabins,</em> $85 or $510 per
week, are handicapped accessible and have microwaves, air conditioning
and a long, covered back deck. They sleep six on two queen beds and a
futon, and eight are allowed.</p>
<p>Four two-bedroom <em>deluxe family cabins,</em>  $100 or $600 weekly, have
all the features of the modern cabins but are two stories and sleep nine
on two full beds, two futons and a single, and 11 are allowed.</p>
<p>Well-tended campgrounds with shower houses are on the west bluff.</p>
<p>There's a grocery store and cafe in Strawberry Point. Backbone Golf &amp;
Country Club adjoins the park's north entrance.</p>
<p>The cabins can be reserved up to a year in advance. They're operated by
a concession, but reserve them on the <a href="https://iowastateparks.reserveamerica.com/">Iowa DNR Reservations
System</a>, 877-427-2757.</p>

<h3>Camper cabins in Iowa state parks</h3>
