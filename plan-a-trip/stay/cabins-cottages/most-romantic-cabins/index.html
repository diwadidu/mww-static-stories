<h2>They're in the woods, with views, vintage charm and modern luxuries (but maybe not all together).</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/ely_burntside_cabin.jpg" alt="A burnt-orange cabin at Ely's Burntside Resort is frequently" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Ely, cabin 26 at Burntside Lodge may be the most-photographed cabin
in Minnesota.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's not easy to find the cabin of your dreams. My friend Ellen knows,
because she's been looking for years.</p>
<p>&quot;I want a cabin with a big stone fireplace, a pine floor and an
old-fashioned bed, nestled in the woods with really tall pines or near a
lake where you can go out skiing during the day,&quot; she says. &quot;Not at
a big resort with a ton of things to do, necessarily, but with some ice
skating, can you picture that?</p>
<p>&quot;Something like Little House in the Woods,&quot; you know, with a braided
rug. It doesn't have to be all fussy and brand-new. So many cabins are
so modern, kind of like a hotel. I like rustic.&quot;</p>
<p>Has she ever found this cabin? Nope.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know if it exists,&quot; she says. &quot;Maybe only in the
movies.&quot;</p>
<p>Two other girlfriends also want cabins in the woods, but one would like
to be within 20 minutes of shopping, and another wants to be near good
restaurants.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>My most memorable stays weren't in perfect cabins. One had flies dying
on windowsills and water stains on the ceiling, but it was built in 1943
of hand-hewn logs taken from old Finnish buildings, and it overflowed
with vintage charm.</p>
<p>One state-park cabin was too modern for me — I couldn't figure out
how to work its glass-ceramic range or even the can opener — but it
had a 45-foot waterfall in its backyard.</p>
<p>There are always trade-offs. Maybe the perfect cabin is the one that
makes you say &quot;Wow!&quot;</p>
<p>Here are 20 (almost) perfect cabins. I've stayed in or toured all of
them.</p>
<h3>Cabins in state parks</h3>
<p>Luckily, for those of us who like classic cabins surrounded by trees,
state parks are full of great places to stay.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/r/oregon_white_pines_cabin.jpg" alt="Log cabins in White Pines Forest State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In northern Illinois, the log cabins in White Pines Forest State Park
are small but romantic.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong>Cabins of the <a href="http://www.whitepinesinn.com/">White Pines Inn</a> in
White Pines Forest State Park near Oregon, Ill</strong> . These 13 log cabins
are adorable, and they're a short walk from a wonderful log restaurant
in the 1927 inn, which also includes a dinner theater.</p>
<p>They're surrounded by trees, but they might be too close to each other
for people who crave solitude. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/oregon-illinois-sightseeing/">On the Rock River in
Illinois</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/tettegouche/tettegouche_camp/index.html">Cabin B in Tettegouche State
Park</a>
near Silver Bay, Minn</strong> . This cabin has the tall pines, Mic Mac Lake at
its doorstep and skiing. But it doesn't have its own bathroom, and you
have to lug all your gear 1¾ miles uphill.</p>
<p>Deal breaker? Not for the people who keep it booked up. For more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/tettegouche/">Heirs to a hideaway</a>.</p>
<p>On the other side of the park, you'll find the modern <strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/tettegouche/illgen_falls_cabin.html">Illgen Falls
Cabin</a></strong>
, the one with the 45-foot-waterfall. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/tettegouche-state-park-cabins/">Cabin on a
waterfall</a>.</p>
<p>Minnesota has many great cabins, including the <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/wild-river-cabin/">guesthouse in Wild River
State Park</a>, which has a
wood-burning fireplace. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/minnesota-state-park-cabins/">Lodgings in Minnesota state
parks</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/backbone_cabin_inside.jpg" alt="Inside a cabin at Backbone State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Backbone, Iowa's first state park, has 16 cabins.

<p><strong><a href="http://iowastateparks.reserveamerica.com/camping/backbone-state-park/r/campgroundFees.do?contractCode=IA&amp;parkId=610105">Cabins in Backbone State
Park</a>
near Strawberry Point, Iowa</strong> .
<a href="http://www.traveliowa.com/aspx/lifestyles.aspx?id=13&amp;lflid=202">Iowa</a>
has a large variety of cabins in its state parks, and some of them are
very handsome. They're also perhaps the best value in the region.</p>
<p>In this stunning northeast Iowa park, family cabins have kitchens and
bathrooms and are only $50 and $85. Deluxe family cabins, $100, are
bigger, fancier and closer to the lake.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/iowa-state-park-cabins/">A cabin in Iowa</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Whitetail Cabin in <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=458&amp;type=SPRK">Holland State
Park</a>
in Holland, Mich</strong> . This heated two-bedroom camper cabin, one of many
in Lake Michigan beach parks, has a refrigerator, microwave and coffee
maker. But the cabin's view of Big Red lighthouse and location right on
the beach make it really choice.</p>
<p>Michigan state parks have a huge array of cabins in all sizes. For more,
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/michigan-state-park-cabins/">Michigan's great lake cabins</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Camper cabins are too rustic to be romantic for a lot of people, but
they're often in the most romantic locations.</p>
<p>For a list of across the Upper Midwest, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/camper-cabins-midwest/">A roof in the
woods</a>.</p>
<h3>Cabins in cities</h3>
<p>It's hard to be close to shopping and restaurants when you're out in
the woods . . . unless you're in Duluth.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cottageonthepoint.com/">Cottage on the Point</a> in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/best-duluth-minnesota/">Duluth</a></strong> .
This cozy three-bedroom cottage has a fireplace and is next to the Lake
Superior beach on Park Point, the sand spit beyond the Aerial Lift
Bridge and the shops and restaurants of Canal Park.</p>
<p>To be closer to snow for skiing, snowshoeing and fat-tire biking, stay
at the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6659537"><strong>Duluth Hiker House</strong></a>,
a block from the trails of Hartley Park. It has a double whirlpool and
steam shower as well as a gas fireplace.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_cabin_interior.jpg" alt="Inside a North Shore cabin." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Minnesota's North Shore, a VRBO cabin features the always-popular
fieldstone fireplace and picture windows.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Vacation-rental cabins</h3>
<p>There is a vast array of privately owned vacation cabins available, and
many allow pets. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/vacation-cottage-house-rentals/">Renting a vacation
house</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.vrbo.com/135736">Superior Solitude</a> in Lutsen, Minn</strong> .
This may be my friend Ellen's dream cabin. It's right on Lake
Superior, with a big stone fireplace, lots of conifers and skiing
nearby.</p>
<p>It's even near restaurants and shopping in Lutsen and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Grand
Marais</a>. I can't remember if it has a braided rug, though.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.superiorvacationrental.net/listings/finn-house/">Finn
House</a> in
Lutsen, Minn</strong> . This is the 1943 log cabin on Lake Superior that my
girlfriends and I adored, though its listing includes a caveat: &quot;The
historic nature of this cabin is a huge part of its charm, but it is not
for everyone.&quot;</p>
<p>If you're looking for a place that's modern and luxurious, however,
you have many , many choices.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>

<h3>Cabins at cross-country ski resorts</h3>
<p><strong>Cabins at <a href="http://www.bearskin.com/lodging/">Bearskin Lodge</a> on
Minnesota's Gunflint Trail</strong> . These classic log cabins are all
attractive, and some have fireplaces (and braided rugs!).</p>
<p>The resort also boasts a Hot Tub Hus, a twinkle-lighted ski loop, fine
dining in the lodge and the state's most reliable snow.</p>
<p>Nearby resorts also have great cabins. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/gunflint-trail-winter/">Winter on
Minnesota's Gunflint
Trail</a>.</p>
<p>For similar cabins elsewhere, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/minnesota-ski-lodges-wisconsin/">Ski out the
door</a>.</p>
<h3>Cabins at traditional resorts</h3>
<p><strong>Cabin 11 at <a href="http://www.cascadelodgemn.com/">Cascade Lodge</a> in Lutsen,
Minn</strong> . Some of the cabins at this classic resort, across the highway
from Lake Superior, are 1923 originals.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/cascade_lodge_snowy_cabin.jpg" alt="A cabin at Cascade Lodge in Minnesota." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Cascade Lodge</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Cabin 11 is reached by its own wooden bridge above a small waterfall.
There's a good restaurant and pub at the resort, and guests can walk
onto the trails of Cascade River State Park or ski onto the Deeryard
trails.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mtnviewlodges.com">Mountain View Lodges</a> in Silver City,
Mich</strong> . These attractive two-bedroom cabins are just outside the
eastern entrance to <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>They've got wood-burning fireplaces, VCRs and cable TV, and four are
open to pets. The resort's sand beach on Lake Superior is lined with
fire pits.</p>
<p>And for a &quot;cabin&quot; that's even better located, check out the
<a href="https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=506&amp;type=SPCG">yurts</a>
right in the park.</p>
<p><strong>Cabins at <a href="http://www.highpointvillage.com">High Point Village</a> near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/timms-hill/">Ogema</a>, Wis.</strong> : 
This resort in north-central Wisconsin, across Bass Lake from the
state's high point, is just off <a href="http://www.timmshilltrail.com/xcskiing.htm">Timm's Hill National
Trail</a>, part of a
50-kilometer network of ski trails.</p>
<p>It rents five attractive chalet cabins with loft and full kitchen.
There's a coffee shop on the premises that sells pastries, soup and
panini.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/o/copper_harbor_lodge_cabin.jpg" alt="A cabin at Keweenaw Mountain Lodge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Harbor</a>, Mich</strong> . These log
cabins were built by the WPA during the 1930s and have big stone
fireplaces. They don't have kitchens, but you can walk to the lodge
restaurant or drive down to town.</p>
<p>Many of my favorite cabins aren't open in winter: the 1938 Fern Creek
at <strong><a href="http://www.shoredge.com/">Koeneke Shoredge Resort</a></strong> on Lake
Superior in Lutsen, Minn.; <strong><a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/lodging/itasca-state-park-berts-cabins.html">Bert's

City</a>, Wis</strong> .:
These five cottages, on a steep hillside above the Mississippi River,
have great views and decks.</p>
<p>Each cottage has two stories, a double whirlpool, a full kitchen and a
pull-out sofa on the first floor. Rates include breakfast supplies and a
bottle of wine.</p>

<p><strong>Townhouses at <a href="http://www.gunflint.com">Gunflint Lodge</a> on the
Gunflint Trail</strong> . They're not cabins, but they feel like them, with
deer feeding outside the door.</p>
<p>They've got VCRs, fireplaces and whirlpools or saunas, and the resort
has a fine restaurant and a bistro in its lodge. A naturalist leads lots
of activities. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/gunflint-lodge-trail/">A Gunflint

<p><strong><a href="http://www.sethpeterson.org/">Seth Peterson Cottage</a> in Mirror Lake
State Park near <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/quiet-wisconsin-dells/">Wisconsin

<p>They're next to the resort's spa and an easy walk down the hill to the
ultra-cozy 1952 pine lodge, the pool complex and the pebble beach at the
mouth of the Poplar River.</p>
