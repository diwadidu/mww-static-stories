</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>My niece loves a large Rottweiler named Rza, so her travel opportunities
are limited.</p>
<p>But one October, I rented a lake house near Cable, Wis., that allowed
dogs, and both of them came. And we all had a great time: When Rza's
happy, everyone's happy.</p>
<p>&quot;This is probably the best weekend of her life,&quot; said my niece,
after we'd spent the day romping on the lawn and in the nearby forest.</p>
<p>For vacationers, houses have many advantages over hotel rooms. Pets are
allowed in some, and they're great for small children or teens, because
the kitchens allow families to save a bundle on restaurant meals.</p>
<p>And they're good for travelers who aren't related — say, a group of
girlfriends - because most have more than one bedroom plus sleeper
sofas.</p>
<p>In lakes country, houses often come with a canoe or rowboat and are
better located than hotels, away from highways and right on the water.
Sometimes, they're available when hotel rooms aren't.</p>

<p>There are more vacation houses to rent than ever. Many owners seek extra
income by joining such rental services as the huge <a href="http://www.vrbo.com">Vacation Rentals by
Owner</a>, which lists hundreds of properties in
Wisconsin's Door County alone, and <a href="http://www.homeaway.com">HomeAway</a>, which is smaller but has a more easily navigated site.</p>
<p>One October, three friends and I rented a house on Minnesota's North
Shore from Cascade Vacation Rentals. The manager told me it would be
rustic, so I warned my friends, but when we got there, they were
enchanted.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not rustic, but if it is, it's a nice kind of rustic,&quot; Becky
said.</p>
<p>Yes, there were flies languishing on the windowsills, and water stains
on the acoustic-tile ceiling. We heard the munching of mice at night,
and the kitchen utensils were old and battered.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/beaver_bay_ridge_house.jpg" alt="A rental house in Beaver Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Minnesota's North Shore and other areas where many people are trying
to sell properties, a whole house may rent for the same price as a fancy
hotel room.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But the Finn House, built in 1943 of hand-hewn logs taken from old
Finnish buildings, was overflowing with charm — at least, our kind of
charm. It sat on five acres along the shore, and a little path led
through old spruces to the edge of a rocky point.</p>
<p>Inside, there was a stone fireplace, walls covered with 1940s woodcuts
of North Shore scenes and picture windows from which we drank our
morning coffee while gazing upon the craggy shoreline and, in the
distance, the hazy harbor of Grand Marais.</p>
<p>The fancier houses aren't necessarily the most popular, said manager
Deborah Nelson. Each house has its own following.</p>
<p>&quot;People will rent the same cabin from year to year, and they consider
it 'theirs,' &quot; she said. &quot;They'll buy gifts for the house; if it
needs a pan or a corkscrew they'll get one, or they'll be out shopping
and think, 'This would be perfect for the cabin.' &quot;</p>
<p>The Finn House, she said, is owned by cousins who live in Toronto,
London and Switzerland, and it's one of the most popular properties.</p>
<p>&quot;So many experiences have been had there, and so many diverse people
have lived there, that it really has an interesting aura,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>The four-bedroom, three-bath Finn House was perfect for four girlfriends
splitting the cost.</p>
<p>But the next October, when I wanted to go up to Wisconsin's north woods
with my two children and my niece, I chose a house that was cheaper and
would accept my niece's dog.</p>
<p>That was the two-bedroom Trapper's Haven on Trapper Lake, just north of
Lake Namekagon off scenic County Road D. It didn't have the character
of the Finn House, but it had a stone fireplace, a nice kitchen, a
two-car garage and a sloping lawn framed by big, beautiful firs.</p>
<p>There was a tiny patch of sand next to a rowboat and the dock, where we
watched the sun set over the lake.</p>
<p>For groups, renting a house can cost less than renting a hotel room, and
in places that are congested in the summer, such as Door County and Lake
Geneva, they provide privacy and some tranquility.</p>
<p>And it's a way to slip into someone else's shoes for a few days. Find
the right house, and it becomes &quot;yours.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;We had some rookies rent a house just last week, and oh, they just
fell in love with the whole deal,&quot; said Cascade Rental's Nelson.
&quot;They're going to come back. For the most part, that's how people
feel: 'Why didn't we ever do this before?' &quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Renting a vacation home</h3>
<p><em>What to know</em> : The Internet is a wonderful way to view houses, and
it's easy to fall in love with the pictures. But even if it's also
possible to reserve on-line, it's still a good idea to talk to a
booking agent in person. Describe your tastes and ask for a
recommendation.</p>
<p>If you're using one of the listing services, such as VRBO, talk to the
owner in person, and make sure that person actually owns the property
(hackers have been known to take over an owner's email address and take
payments). <em>Never wire money</em> ; use only credit cards to reserve.</p>
<p>Not everyone should rent a house. Remember, you'll have to clean up
after yourself and take out the trash, and there's no one at the front
desk to instantly solve your problems.</p>
<p>Always clear pets in advance. And even if a property listing doesn't
say pets are allowed, ask; the manager may let you bring a pet if you
sound like a responsible person.</p>
<p>Ask what you do and don't need to bring (see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/cabin-packing-list/">What to bring to a rented
cabin</a> ). Don't be afraid to
ask specific questions, because photos don't always tell the whole
story.</p>
<p>There's almost always a two-night minimum, and it's often a week in
summer. Sometimes, the seventh night is free. Check for specials,
especially in the off season.</p>
