<h2>In Minnesota's Wild River State Park, a guesthouse lets guests dwell in comfort amid 7,000 acres of beauty.</h2>

The Wild River State Park guesthouse is close to ski trails.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the middle of Minnesota's Wild River State Park, a ski's length from
35 miles of groomed trails and a 10-minute trek from the St. Croix
River, sits a cozy little house surrounded by forest.</p>
<p>For one winter night, the two-bedroom, carpeted house, a private
residence built not long before the park was established in 1978,
belonged to me and my children.</p>
<p>We arrived at dusk, and my children swarmed over it as only children can
do, giving a running commentary: &quot;Boy, this is a nice cabin,&quot; said my
son Peter. &quot;Wow, a nice shower. Isn't this great? And oh, look&quot; — he
peered out the window at a big thermometer — &quot;you can tell the
temperature.&quot;</p>
<p>It was 0 degrees. But we settled in happily, building a fire in the
wood-burning stone hearth, making spaghetti in the modern kitchen, then
sliding a movie into the VCR and watching it while eating popcorn popped
in the microwave.</p>
<p>It was a little odd, being the only humans that night in one of
Minnesota's largest state parks, but we were definitely comfortable.</p>
<p>Who needs rustic, anyway? Very few, we concluded later, reading entries
in the three cabin journals.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;This place is utopia, nirvana and heaven all rolled into one,&quot; wrote
Eric and Kris from Minneapolis. A Wisconsin man wrote, &quot;I would like to
rent this for the rest of my life.&quot; One woman asked those reading the
journals to refrain from renting the house on Valentine's Day, so she
could have it.</p>
<p>Fat chance! The competition for Minnesota's state-park guest houses is
fierce. When I called on Oct. 8, I was pleasantly surprised that the
nights of Dec. 29-30, a Tuesday and Wednesday during school holidays,
were available, and I told the reservationist I'd take them.</p>
<p>But I rejoiced too soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Funny, now I show that as unavailable,&quot; she said a second later. &quot;No
kidding — someone must've reserved it as we were talking. I guess
that's a very popular place.&quot;</p>
<p>The only other night available during a winter weekend, holiday or
school-break day was Tuesday, Dec. 22. I knew there might not be snow
then, a shame considering Wild River's great ski trails, but I took it.</p>
<p>And we had a wonderful time, even though there wasn't enough snow to
ski. We awoke to brilliant sunshine and the same 0-degree temperature,
but we bundled up and headed into the woods.</p>
<p>I wanted to take the trail from our door down to the river and the old
Nevers Dam site, but my daughter Madeleine complained.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do we have to stick to a trail when we can go through the trees?&quot;
she asked. The park had turned them into Lewis and Clark. They scampered
up the trunk of a fallen tree and, when we got to the river, set out
investigating its banks.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/wild_river_skiing.jpg" alt="Skiing at Wild River State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Wild River is a popular place to cross-country ski.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>After the infamous Taylors Falls log jam of 1886, a dam was built there
to regulate the flow of logs. Now it's long gone, but there's an
overlook with interpretive plaques about the logging era and a stairway
leading to the water.</p>
<p>The children ran down it to explore, stomping on the ice closest to the
banks, drawing in the snow with sticks and gingerly walking across a
crackling slough that was sheathed in feathery ice crystals.</p>
<p>I walked down river to get a closer look at six enormous white birds
that were arching long necks with hypnotic synchronicity. They were the
park's resident trumpeter swans, fishing off a sandbar in open water.</p>
<p>Then we walked along the River Trail and climbed 164 steps back up the
hill. Along the bluff, we stopped by the park's camper cabins, which
have great views of the St. Croix Valley. They're popular, too, though
not so luxurious.</p>
<p>Back at the cabin, we washed the dishes, vacuumed and headed home,
stopping to buy Swedish potato sausage at <a href="http://rodscountrycorner.com/">Rod's Country
Corner</a> in Almelund, which is a good
place to buy last-minute groceries or rent a video on the way to Wild
River.</p>
<p>We took the scenic route home, past Wild Mountain Ski Area and through
Taylors Falls to <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/interstate/index.html">Interstate State
Park</a>,
where Madeleine and Peter had a swell time clambering through the
boulders and sliding on the bottom of the 35-foot Bake Oven pothole,
which had turned into an otherworldly ice rink.</p>
<p>West of town, we stopped at the <a href="http://www.franconia.org">Franconia Sculpture
Park</a> and explored the field of installations,
from an oversized yellow atom to a gazebo with swinging glass walls.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It was a short but sweet expedition, and the children loved it. Wild
River is especially popular because it's close to the Twin Cities, but
each state-park guest house has something special to offer.</p>
<p>And in the winter, there's the added draw of absolute quiet.</p>
<p>&quot;In winter, a lot of folks like having the park all to themselves,&quot;
said Marty Torgerson of Bear Head Lake State Park near Ely, which has a
large guest house. &quot;You can stand on the deck listening to the wolves
howling and the trees popping, and experience what a true cold Minnesota
night is all about.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Lodgings in Wild River State Park</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : It's an hour northeast of the Twin Cities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/wild_river/guesthouse.html"><strong>Wild River
guesthouse</strong></a>
: It rents for $120 and sleeps six, but four would be a more
comfortable number. Guests must bring bedding and towels. The kitchen is
fully equipped. Soap and firewood are provided. Guests are expected to
clean the house before leaving.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/reservations_campercabin.html"><strong>Wild River camper
cabins</strong></a>
: The park also has six heated camper cabins, with bunks and a table but
no running water. Four of the cabins sleep six; two sleep five and are
handicapped-accessible. In summer, there are showers and flush toilets;
in winter, a latrine.</p>
<p>For more about camper cabins, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/camper-cabins-midwest/">A roof in the
woods</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Reservations</strong> : Reserve up to 120 days in advance
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/reservations_lodging.html">online</a>
or at 866-857-2757. On the first day of availability, reservations can
be made starting at 8 a.m. Central Standard Time; after the first day,
they can be made online 24 hours a day.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/wild_river/index.html">Wild River State
Park</a></strong> :
Wild River is one of the lucky state parks with a full-time naturalist,
so there are programs year-round.</p>
<p>In winter, there's a candlelight ski in January, and cross-country skis
and snowshoes can be rented at the modern Trail Center, which has a
fireplace and snack bar.</p>
