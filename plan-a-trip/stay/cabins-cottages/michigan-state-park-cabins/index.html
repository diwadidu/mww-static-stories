<p>On a summer day in Holland, Mich., all roads lead to the beach.</p>
<p>When we were there one June, people streamed toward this broad swath of
sand until the sun fell low on the horizon, making the fire-engine-red
harbor beacon glow like an ember. They ate ice cream, they strolled on
the breakwall, they took a last dip in Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>But at 10 p.m. sharp, a police cruiser started flashing its red lights
to shepherd everyone out of the park.</p>
<p>Except us, because we were sitting on the porch of our camper cabin with
cold drinks from our fridge, a bowl of freshly popped popcorn and a
killer view of the lake and Big Red, the beloved 1907 lighthouse.</p>
<p>The RV crowd also got to stay, on a strip of asphalt behind the dunes,
and even though they didn't have a view, they also felt lucky to be
there.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the bath house, I heard two women talking: &quot;We only got to stay five
nights this year, so I guess I'll have to be faster online,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>This <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-lake-michigan/">inland seacoast</a>
— with sand, sand and more sand — is the place to be in summer. Stay
in one of Michigan's famous beach parks, and you're right there for the
fiery sunsets <em>and</em> the pastel sunrises.</p>
<p>Michigan rents more than 160 state-park cabins and lodges, on lakes
Huron, Michigan and Superior as well as inland lakes and forests, and
they're available for anyone who's fast enough on the draw.</p>
<p>Competition is fierce for summer. If you want Holland State Park's
Whitetail cabin on a weekend, or one of Ludington State Park's three
mini-cabins, the time to reserve is right now — for next year.</p>
<p>In early March, I reserved five weeknights at three kinds of cabins in
five state parks. We traveled in late June, the lull just
before peak season on Lake Michigan, and park managers and campground
hosts were girding for the onslaught.</p>
<p>&quot;In July, it's chaos,&quot; said campground host Jack Denneny of Sault Ste.
Marie, Ont., who's volunteered at Traverse City State Park with his
wife, Sherry, for years.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porcupines_kaug_wudjoo_lodge.jpg" alt="Kaug Wudjoo Lodge in the Porkies." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Our first stop, however, was one of the quieter parks — <em>J.W. Wells
State Park,</em> just 25 miles east of Marinette, Wis., on the Upper
Peninsula.</p>
<p>Our large rustic cabin didn't have electricity, but it slept 10 and had
a propane stove, covered porch, picnic table, grill, fire pit and a long
yard that stretched to the Lake Michigan shoreline.</p>
<p>A border of trees separated our cabins from our neighbors, who had each
built a fire and were gathered around their pits. And each cabin had its
own latrine: For campers, true luxury.</p>
<p>The next day, we checked out the rest of the park, which included a
really nice playground in the campground and a broad, well-kept sand
beach with volleyball net and swings.</p>
<p>Not far from the beach, we saw handsome Bay Stone Lodge, the former park
manager's home, which sleeps 12 and has two full baths and a great room
with a stone fireplace.</p>
<p>Our next stop was across the Mackinac Bridge in Traverse City, which
stretches along the West Arm and East Arm of Grand Traverse Bay.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Traverse
City</a></strong>
is one of those cities that sprawls, and by the time we reached
<em>Traverse City State Park,</em> we already felt we'd driven through quite a
bit of town, though we still were on the far east end.</p>
<p>The park is squeezed between the highway and the rail line, but it's
connected to the rest of town by the 10½-mile TART bike trail, which we
rode into the fun part of Traverse City — the beaches, the marina, the
downtown, the Old Town district.</p>
<p>When we got back, we walked over the pedestrian overpass to the park's
big beach on the West Arm, where people still were swimming in the
fading light of day.</p>
<p>Our mini-cabin was smaller than the one at Wells, but it had a fridge,
microwave, skylights, an upholstered chair and a breakfast bar with
stools.</p>
<p>Host Jack and Sherry's rig was next door, with a gazebo they'd stocked
with brochures about local festivals, nightlife, tourist attractions and
restaurants.</p>
<p>&quot;There's so much to do around here,&quot; Jack said. &quot;It's an urban park.
You can go to the Omelette Shop for breakfast, and if you don't feel
like cooking, you go to Pizza Hut.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/a/tawas_point_cabin_michdnr_small.jpg" alt="A camper cabin in Tawas Point State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Michigan DNR</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Our next stop was not far away, at the tip of the Leelanau Peninsula.
<em>Leelanau State Park</em> wraps around the Grand Traverse Lighthouse, which
is why most people visit, but it also has a rustic campground that faces
Lake Michigan and includes three mini-cabins.</p>
<p>Our cabin, the Evergreen, was a former park
office lovingly renovated by park manager Al Ammons.</p>
<p>It was set in a fragrant cedar forest and had a covered porch with
Adirondack chairs, stainless steel microwave and refrigerator,
decorative glass pendant lights, a ceiling fan, a framed oil painting
and green-painted doors.</p>
<p>It also had a large, polished wood table, on which we played three games
of &quot;Campin' Out,&quot; a board game about Michigan state parks. By then, we
actually knew the answer to &quot;What was the second national park in the
world?&quot; (Michigan's Fort Mackinac, now a state park.)</p>
<p>The only thing the campground didn't have was a beach — I walked down
to the shore, but it was lined with rocks and shoe-sucking muck — and
showers. The next day, we drove back to Traverse City State Park and
used the ones there for $2 each.</p>
<p>At our fourth stop, <em>Orchard Beach State Park</em> just north of Manistee,
we'd reserved a camper cabin, the most expensive kind of
state-park cabin other than lodges. It had a wrap-around porch with Adirondack chairs, two
bedrooms and a living area with sofa, in addition to a microwave, fridge
and coffeemaker.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But I coveted the park's mini-cabin for its location right on the bluff
overlooking Lake Michigan. Orchard Beach is all about location; it
occupies a wooded strip of land above a beautiful beach, reached by
stairway.</p>
<p>We joined a dozen other campers on the edge of the bluff to admire an
orange sunset framed by gathering clouds. For the third night in a row
it rained, this time with winds so strong they drove water through the
bedroom window I'd left cracked.</p>
<p>And for the third night in a row, we were happy to have a roof.</p>
<p>From Orchard Beach, we passed one beach park after another: Ludington,
where there's a mini-cabin in each of three campgrounds. Mears and Grand
Haven, each with a lodge. Muskegon, with two mini-cabins.</p>
<p>We spent much of the day at Ludington, picnicking and biking through the
dunes to Point Sable Lighthouse, and rolled into <em>Holland State Park</em> in
early evening.</p>
<p>At the gate to the beach, the teen-age employee said she'd never heard
of camper cabins, but just to our right, I could see the tip of a peaked
roof over the sand.</p>

Hill Lodge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We'd struck gold: It was our cabin, the Whitetail, the best digs on the
beach.</p>
<p>For the first time, we took advantage of the parks' generous 1 p.m.
check-out time. My husband spent the next morning bicycling to Grand
Haven on the 20-mile Lakeshore Trail, and I sunned myself into a stupor
on the beach, occasionally taking a swim in the crystal-clear, 62-degree
water.</p>
<p>We hated to leave, especially when we saw the sign &quot;Reentry not
guaranteed.&quot; It turns out there's a reason so many people bicycle or
walk into the park.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the busiest park in the state for day use,&quot; the friendly young
traffic attendant said. &quot;It's like this every day the sun is out. On a
slow day we might fill by 1:30 or 2, but on holidays we fill at 10
a.m.&quot;</p>
<p>From Holland, we drove through Saugatuck and South Haven to Warren Dunes
State Park, which has three mini-cabins. But we couldn't have one; they
were long booked for a Friday night, and Warren Dunes, so close to
Chicago, has a three-night minimum.</p>
<p>So we stayed in a nearby Super 8. We had a shower but no porch, no view
and no sunset. After five nights in parks, Michigan had spoiled us.</p>

800-447-2757.</p>
<p>Mini-cabins on the Lower Peninsula have a minimum rental of two nights
(Warren Dunes, three nights), unless odd nights are available.</p>
<p>The reservation fee per park (not per order) is $8. If you cancel
before the day of arrival, you'll lose the reservation fee and pay an
additional $10. If you're reserving online, beware: You have to
complete the reservation in 15 minutes or all your work will disappear.</p>
<p>For a guide to Michigan state parks and recreation areas, call
517-373-9900.</p>
<p>Call each park to find out exactly what each cabin includes; each is a
little different, especially in the rustic cabins.</p>
<p><em>Vehicle fee</em> : Non-residents pay $9 for a daily pass, $34 for an
annual pass. Michigan residents pay $17 for an annual pass.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : May and most of June is fairly quiet. Peak season starts
the last weekend of June and lasts until mid-August. September is a
great time to go, when the crowds are gone but the lake still is warm,
and many of the cabins are open in winter.</p>

<p><em>What to bring:</em>  In the mini-cabins, rustic cabins and camper cabins,
campers must bring all bedding, cookware and tableware. Bunk beds (many
include a double) and mattresses are provided. Cooking must be done
outside, where there are picnic tables and grills or fire rings.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/cabin-packing-list/">What to bring to a rented
cabin</a>.</p>
<p>Pets are not permitted inside the cabins. Guests are expected to sweep
and otherwise leave the cabin as they found it.</p>
<p>Here's a list of Michigan's <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/things-to-do/camping-and-lodging/lodging">camper cabins, mini-cabins, rustic cabins
and
lodges</a> (as well as yurts, tepees and pop-up campers for rent), and here's
what to expect.</p>
<p><strong>Camper cabins:</strong> These are the newest and most posh lodgings. They
sleep up to seven people with two sets of bunk beds (one usually is a
double) in their own rooms and a futon or sofa in the main living area.</p>
<p>They're generally on scenic lots overlooking lakes, bays and rivers and
have a covered front porch.</p>
<p>They have microwaves, refrigerators and coffee makers, and some have
ceiling fans and toasters. All are universally accessible. Cost is
$65-$80.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/michigan_wells_minicabin.jpg" alt="A mini-cabin in Michigan state parks." /><p class="copyright">&copy; David Kenyon/DNR</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Not far from the Wisconsin border, J.W. Wells State Park has five large
rustic cabins with lawns that roll out to the lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong>Mini-cabins:</strong> These cabins generally are compact. They have fridges
and microwaves and sleep four. Some are accessible, and some aren't.
Cost is $45-$65.</p>
<p><strong>Rustic cabins:</strong>  These cabins tend to be on quiet, isolated sites
and vary greatly, accommodating between two to 24 people. They don't
have electricity (bring lanterns to hang on hooks), but they may have
such amenities as a gas stove. Cost is $50-$60.</p>
<p><em>Lodges and cottages:</em> These also vary greatly; some are modern
ramblers that once housed park rangers and some are historic stone or
log lodges from the 1920s.</p>
<p>All include fully equipped kitchens, and bedding and towels are
provided. Many have washers and dryers and some have televisions and DVD
players.</p>
