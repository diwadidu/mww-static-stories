<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/la_crosse_schoolhouse_inn.jpg" alt="Wilson Schoolhouse Inn near La Crosse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Just outside La Crosse, the Wilson Schoolhouse Inn occupies a 1917
country school.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's not every inn that makes a guest feel like a Rockefeller.</p>
<p>But when my husband and I walked into the Wilson Schoolhouse Inn, we
figured we had really risen in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, for once I feel like a millionaire,&quot; Torsten said, bounding
around the restored Prairie-style school. &quot;This is unbelievably cool.&quot;</p>
<p>Between 1917 and 1965, country children learned their ABCs in this brick
one-room country schoolhouse, now on the outskirts of La Crosse. Then it
sat, deteriorating, until Lisbeth and Richard Reynertson decided to save
it, though both were busy with careers.</p>
<p>Over 14 years, they turned its classroom into an airy living room, lined
with 9-foot windows on two sides, black-and-white art photographs on a
third and a spectacular kitchen on the fourth. In the lower-level
gymnasium, they put two beautifully furnished bedrooms and a living
area.</p>
<p>Then they opened the schoolhouse to overnight guests, stocking the
shelves with CDs and videos, the kitchen counters with snacks and the
tabletops with fresh flowers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Why? Because they loved the schoolhouse and wanted to share it.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a real joy,&quot; said Lisbeth Reynertson. &quot;There's a need
for places like this, where people can come together.&quot;</p>
<h3>Picking a place</h3>
<p>Men often prefer cottages to B&amp;Bs because they don't have to talk to
strangers over breakfast or feel as if they're living in someone
else's house.</p>
<p>Cottages also can work well for families; when we were staying at an
organic farm outside Mount Horeb, Wis., we talked to an Illinois couple
who had brought their two young children to stay in the inn's cabin,
which had a wood-burning stove, games and books.</p>
<p>They like staying in B&amp;Bs, they said, but don't want to seem
inconsiderate of other guests. So they look for a separate space, such
as a cottage.</p>
<p>Those of us who have found the really great cottages are completely
spoiled. Below are some  favorites:</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/maplewood_lodge_mineral_point.jpg" alt="maple wood lodge in mineral point" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
