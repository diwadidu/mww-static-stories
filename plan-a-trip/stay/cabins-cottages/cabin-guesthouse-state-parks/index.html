<p>When you stay in a state park, you can't expect a lot of nightlife.</p>
<p>Unless you count all of the stars. And the candlelight skiing. And the
hot-cocoa cocktails.</p>
<p>There's a lot to do in a state park, night and day. When friends and I
rented a guesthouse in St. Croix State Park, we became part of an
exclusive club — people who get to stay in relative luxury while being
right in the middle of the action.</p>
<p>Our six-bedroom, two-bath guesthouse was one of two. Both have WiFi and
look as if they belong in the suburbs, not in the middle of Minnesota's
largest state park.</p>
<p>I rented the guesthouse for the park's annual candlelight ski and
brought nine friends. We fixed dinner in our kitchen, then drove over to
the trailhead, where we skied two loops past glowing paper lanterns.</p>
<p>In the 1930s stone lodge, park rangers had built a wood fire and were
serving mugs of hot cocoa.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Back at the house, we had a glass of wine, settled onto sofas and
chatted. Our living room had a big TV, but we didn't even turn it on.</p>
<p>In the morning, we put on snowshoes and hiked down to the St. Croix
River, walking on ice along the shoreline before making our way back. A
stone's throw from the house, we looked up and saw a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151489033780129&amp;set=a.114471060128.120661.104777055128&amp;type=1&amp;theater">boreal
owl</a>
on a low branch almost overhead.</p>
<p>For 10 minutes, we looked at it, and it looked at us, cocking its head
quizzically. Finally, it flew away, with the occupants of the other
guesthouse — they'd seen us looking up — in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>For one night, we paid $23 apiece; if we'd brought 12 people, the
price would have dropped to $19. The other guesthouse sleeps 15, so
costs there could be as low as $15 apiece.</p>
<p>If you make all of your meals in the kitchen — and the closest
restaurants are at the Grand Casino Hinckley and in Danbury, Wis. --
you've got a very inexpensive vacation.</p>
<p>And in many ways, the amenities of the park rival those of the most
expensive resorts. You can rent snowshoes, a canoe or a kayak, and use
of fishing kits, birding kits and a GPS for geocaching is free.</p>
<p>In summer, there's a swimming beach.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_croix_guesthouse.jpg" alt="A guesthouse at St. Croix State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In eastern Minnesota, St. Croix State Park has two guesthouses.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We went to ski on 11 miles of groomed trails, but St. Croix State Park
also is especially popular with snowmobilers, who have 80 miles of
groomed trails that connect with state forests.</p>
<p>A stay in the guesthouse doesn't include maid service, so we had to
vacuum, sweep and take out the garbage before we left. And we had to
bring our own towels, pillows and sheets or sleeping bags.</p>
<p>Still, we felt pretty lucky.</p>
<p>The state also rents modern cabins and guesthouses (and one golf chalet)
in six other parks.</p>
<p>It's surprising how many state parks rent modern cabins and
guesthouses. Here's how to find and reserve them.</p>
<p>Reservations open a year in advance, so you'll have to plan far ahead
for weekend stays. Weekdays in summer fill up, too, but it's much
easier to get a reservation.</p>
<p>Typically, you have to bring your own linens and towels. Kitchens are
equipped with the basics, some more basic than others. For tips on what
else you might need, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/cabin-packing-list/">What to bring to a rented
cabin</a>.</p>
