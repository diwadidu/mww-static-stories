<h2>On the Internet, exchanging homes is easier than ever.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/homexchange_sandiego.jpg" alt="House in San Diego." /><p class="copyright">&copy; HomeExchange.com</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The owners of this house in suburban San Diego want to exchange in
Chicago, Milwaukee or elsewhere in Wisconsin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the age of the Internet, house exchanging has grown up.</p>
<p>In 1991, still the era of snail mail and high-priced international phone
calls, I wanted to exchange my home for one in Europe. But few people
wanted to come to Minnesota.</p>
<p>I hadn't listed Sweden as a preferred destination, but a family in
Stockholm's Old Town asked about an exchange. By the time I sent them
information about my home, they'd found one elsewhere, and I exchanged
instead with a family in southern Sweden.</p>
<p>We spent three weeks in July there. What we didn't know is that Sweden
is practically deserted in July, because everyone is vacationing in
Spain and Italy.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to the Internet, it's much easier to exchange homes - and
to find out what you need to know.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When I type in &quot;Minnesota&quot; on the
<a href="http://www.homeexchange.com">HomeExchange</a> web site, I find nearly 20
families who are interested in coming here. They're offering homes in
Spain, Denmark, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. Within the United
States, homes are in Boston, San Diego, Seattle and Los Angeles as well
as Vermont, Texas, South Carolina, Colorado and New York.</p>
<p>Usually, people who want to visit the Upper Midwest have relatives or
friends here. Sometimes, business brings them to the state. Isabelle
Durrieu's husband was sent to Minneapolis for the month of July, so she
wanted to exchange her sunny flat in the heart of Barcelona for a home
in the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>&quot;We could rent a flat or live in a hotel, since my husband's firm will
pay for that, but I think it's much more interesting to live in someone
else's house with toys and books for the children, and to have this
feeling that you're not only a tourist but that you discover a little
bit more of how the people live in another country,&quot; she wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought we could contact with the neighbours, maybe, and live a
little bit of a real American life for a month.&quot;</p>
<p>Who knew there would be such demand for houses in flyover land? The
truth is, Midwesterners still are the little fishermen in a big pond.
But now, we can throw our net a lot farther.</p>
<h3>Teachers were first</h3>
<p>In 1953, teachers attending a conference in Europe started brainstorming
about how teachers should exchange homes with each other over the summer
holidays. Two of the teachers, one from Sweden and one from the
Netherlands, founded Intervac, the first home-exchange organization.</p>
<p>It's a simple concept: Instead of paying for a hotel room, stay free in
someone else's house. Save more money by exchanging cars. See how other
people live and make new friends — often, the host's neighbors,
friends and relatives, who take the vacationing guest under their wings.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/homexchange_australia.jpg" alt="Home in Sydney, Australia." /><p class="copyright">&copy; HomeExchange.com</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The owners of this view in suburban Sydney, Australia, want to exchange
with a family in Madison, Wis., over Christmas.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>That's how it works in the film &quot;The Holiday,&quot; in which Cameron Diaz
swaps her Los Angeles mansion for Kate Winslet's English cottage; Diaz
strikes up a relationship with Winslet's brother, played by Jude Law,
and Winslet with Jack Black, a colleague of Diaz's ex-boyfriend.</p>
<p>It's Hollywood cute, but not really unrealistic, says George Balen, vice
president of HomeExchange, the company mentioned in the film.</p>
<p>&quot;Exchanging becomes very property-oriented, but really it's all about
people,&quot; he says. &quot;They make friends, then go on exchanges together and
even swap children for the summer. As corny as it sounds, it really is a
family. It becomes a way of life for a lot of these members.&quot;</p>
<p>HomeExchange has grown rapidly and now has more than 36,000 listings in
131 countries. Like Internet dating, Balen says, home exchanging once
was considered odd but now is mainstream.</p>
<p>&quot;It used to be the first question was, 'Is that a time share?' &quot; he
said. &quot;But just recently, people understand what it is. They find it
really appealing, the whole concept of swapping lives and avoiding the
tourist situation in a hotel.&quot;</p>
<p>Although HomeExchange got the mention in &quot;The Holiday,&quot; Intervac USA
representative Jessica Jaffe says the exposure should help her company
by explaining the home-exchange concept.</p>
<p>&quot;It's something that might be hard for people to wrap their heads
around,&quot; Jaffe says.</p>
<h3>Mutually assured protection</h3>
<p>It's true that strangers will live in your house. However, it's likely
they'll take good care of it, since you're living in their house.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;We've never had a major complaint about damage,&quot; Jaffe says. &quot;It just
doesn't happen.&quot;</p>
<p>Luckily, people who worry about broken wineglasses aren't likely to
exchange in the first place.</p>
<p>&quot;I like the experience of trusting that you're all going to take care of
each other,&quot; says Joan Semling Bostian of Fairfax, Calif. &quot;It connects
you to other people.&quot;</p>
<p>Semling Bostian, with her husband and three young daughters, has
exchanged her home near San Francisco for homes in France, Germany, Lake
Tahoe and the Twin Cities, where she has relatives.</p>
<p>She has particularly fond memories of her stay in the St. Paul home of
artist Tippy Maurant. At the last minute, Maurant was asked to jury an
art show and didn't travel to California, but she honored her commitment
to the Bostians.</p>
<p>&quot;That ended up being really great,&quot; Semling Bostian said. &quot;The house
was impeccable, and she'd put out a basket with chocolates and cinnamon
bread, and art supplies for the kids. We had lots of room, so we didn't
have to impose on relatives. And we could have people in to see us
rather than always going to see them.&quot;</p>
<p>Nancy Svendsen lives near Semling Bostian in Corte Madera, Calif., and
she, too, liked to exchange in Minnesota, partly to visit family and
college friends but also to show her husband some of her favorite
college haunts.</p>
<p>&quot;Minnesota in summer is terrific,&quot; says Svendsen, who attended St. Olaf
and the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Her first exchange was in 2006, when she, her husband and their young
twins exchanged houses and cars with a family in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>&quot;We saved so much money it was unbelievable,&quot; she said. &quot;My in-laws
came with us, and our hosts talked to their friends down the street and
arranged for the in-laws to stay a week and a half in their home. They
really went the extra mile.&quot;</p>
<h3>Midwest is a harder sell</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/homeexchange_bainbridge_island.jpg" alt="House on Bainbridge Island." /><p class="copyright">&copy; HomeExchange.com</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The owners of this home on Bainbridge Island, Wash., across Puget Sound
from Seattle, are hoping to visit the Twin Cities in the winter of 2011.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>California is a popular destination for Europeans, so the Svendsens had
two families to choose from in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>But Midwestern families who want to exchange in continental Europe might
be frustrated by the apparent lack of interest in any U.S. destination
beyond California, New York City, Florida and Hawaii.</p>
<p>That's why they have to work a little harder.</p>
<p>In 2006, when Scott Baumann of Glenwood City, Wis., decided to plan a
Europe trip for his family of six, he sent out &quot;a couple hundred&quot;
requests, not knowing how many people would be interested in coming to a
rural home  in a little-known state.</p>
<p>But he received several dozen replies, and the family ended up staying
in a chalet in the ski resort of Chamonix, France.</p>
<p>The French owners, however, did not travel to Wisconsin. They noticed
that Scott and Sonya Baumann had teen-age daughters the same age as
theirs, and they asked if the Baumanns would host their daughters during
August.</p>
<p>Then they used the Baumanns' visit to get to know them.</p>
<p>&quot;They rolled out the red carpet for us,&quot; Scott Baumann said. &quot;On three
days, they took us hiking in the French Alps, the Swiss Alps and the
Italian Alps. When they found out we wanted to go to Provence, they bent
over backward to put a trip together for us. I'd challenge  anyone to
come up with a vacation to rival that.&quot;</p>
<p>On the same trip, they stayed at a home in Sarnano, Italy, between
Tuscany and the Adriatic.</p>
<p>They also arranged a trip to Sydney, Australia, but the Australians had
a death in the family and had to cancel. It was a bitter disappointment.</p>
<p>&quot;They'd sent us a big care package, with Vegemite and tons of
information,&quot; Baumann said. &quot;Her parents have a sheep station in the
bush, and they were going to take us horseback camping.&quot;</p>
<p>Another summer, they considered exchanging either with a family in
Norway or a dairy veterinarian in Normandy, France, who, Baumann says,
&quot;thinks going to Wisconsin is like Shangri-La.&quot; The family also has
been contacted by people in Florida, California and Hawaii.</p>
<p>&quot;It's pretty wild,&quot; Baumann says. &quot;I wish we could take a year off.&quot;</p>
<h3>How to arrange an exchange</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/homeexchange_baumann_farm.jpg" alt="Farm in Glenwood City, Wis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; HomeExchange.com</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The owners of this estate in rural Wisconsin have received exchange
offers from all over the world.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For every thousand homes offered for exchange, there are a thousand
stories.</p>
<p>In 1991, I exchanged homes with a pair of Trotskyite socialists (this is
what their friends called them) from Sweden who dripped condescension
for the United States but arrived with empty suitcases so they could
stock up on cheap goods.</p>
<p>When I gave them a tour of Minneapolis' famous Chain of Lakes, they
said nothing except &quot;Where do all the poor people live?&quot; . . . as if
I'd been hiding them.</p>
<p>The same year, Betsy Sansby and Al Dworsky of the Minneapolis suburb of
Minnetonka exchanged with a Scottish couple.</p>
<p>When they arrived in Scotland, they were met by the husband, who
announced that his wife was having an affair and had left him, and
therefore he would be staying with Betsy and Al until he could move in
with his mother.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a marriage counselor, and the last thing I wanted was to be
counseling Mopey Nick for the first 10 days of our fabulous
vacation,&quot; Sansby said.</p>
<p>Would we have been able to get a better read on these people if we'd
gotten to know them over the Internet, in more depth? Definitely.</p>
<p>On their next exchange, four years later, Sansby was able to use e-mail
to correspond with a family in Ireland and had &quot;a fabulous swap,&quot;
she said.</p>
<p>We'd both used Intervac, which had sent us a thick catalog of home
listings, each with a tiny black-and-white photo and a brief description
in symbols and abbreviations.</p>
<p>Arranging an exchange is much easier these days. Now, Sansby uses
Internet-only HomeExchange, where she has posted lengthy descriptions of
her home, her neighborhood and herself and her husband, plus a dozen
photos, including her garden in full bloom and a glorious autumn photo
of the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum.</p>
<p>&quot;It's really unlimited what you can show,&quot; says George Balen, vice
president of HomeExchange. &quot;If you have a digital camera, go nuts. I
figure more is better.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to listings, HomeExchange and other companies offer advice
and sample exchange agreements. But it's up to each party to arrange
the exchange.</p>
<p>It's easiest to snare the best properties in the most in-demand
destinations — Italy is No. 1 — if you have a second home on a beach
in Florida or California. But you also can exchange for a home in the
Midwest, if you work hard to market it.</p>
<p>&quot;If you put the word out, you might be surprised,&quot; Balen said.
&quot;They might not have thought twice about an area, but they got the
nicest letter from a lady there, and it's like, 'Sold!' &quot;</p>
<p>Here are some tips that will help you arrange a good exchange.</p>
<h3>Sell the area as well as your home</h3>
<p>When Betsy Sansby wanted to exchange for the home in Ireland, she worked
hard on what she thought was &quot;a very seductive letter.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was talking about the lakes and the nature,&quot; she said. &quot;Then I
met someone at the Wedge (food co-op) who had an Irish accent, and she
said, 'They're not interested in your nature, they want to shop. Tell
them about your shopping.' So I talked about the shops and the Mall of
America, and I think that was a big hit.&quot;</p>
<p>The Mall of America is a huge draw. Still, tailor your pitch to
nationality. Australians might be dying to see snow and the northern
lights. Parisians might want to sit around a campfire and make s'mores.
Germans are fascinated by Indian culture and would love to see a powwow.</p>
<h3>Start early</h3>
<p>&quot;One thing I learned is we waited too long to do the research,&quot; says
Joan Semling Bostian of Fairfax, Calif. &quot;It seems most people do it in
December and January, if possible, especially if it's
international.&quot;</p>
<p>She started looking in March and was starting to panic when she found a
family in France that also had started late.</p>
<h3>Be imaginative</h3>
<p>You can exchange your home for anything — a cabin, an RV, canoes and
camping gear, even a hosted stay for teen-agers, as did the French
family in whose ski chalet the Baumanns of Glenwood City, Wis., stayed
one year.</p>
<h3>Be realistic about life in other countries</h3>
<p>European houses aren't nearly as roomy and don't have the yard space
ours do. And something they call a house may be what we'd call a
townhouse, duplex or fourplex.</p>
<p>And, while many Europeans are very hospitable and generous, don't
expect them to be quite as open and outgoing as many Americans.</p>
<h3>Don't assume</h3>
<p>In Sweden, my biggest mistake was assuming that there would be a lot
going on in summer, as there is in Minnesota — festivals, outdoor
concerts, sidewalk cafes. But southern Sweden was practically deserted,
because everyone had left for the entire month of July.</p>
<p>Scandinavians tend to vacation in July, says Jessica Jaffe of Intervac,
and people in France, Spain and Italy tend to vacation in August. Paris
and Rome in particular are notorious for emptying out in August.</p>
<p>And don't assume summer is warm everywhere. Northern Europe can be cool
and gray; San Francisco also is chilly in summer. Parts of Australia are
warm year-round, but not all of it.</p>
<h3>Ask for details about everything</h3>
<p>One California exchanger knew there would be cats, and assumed there
would be one or two. There were five — white ones, and the carpet was
navy blue. They did a lot of vacuuming.</p>
<p>They also assumed their guests would use their car mostly for day trips.
Instead, they took it to the Grand Canyon, putting 4,000 miles on the
car.</p>
<h3>Get it in writing</h3>
<p>Exchange companies provide sample agreements. Use them to outline what
happens if, for example, a car needs repairs, or one party has an
accident and insurance rates rise.</p>
<h3>Choose an exchange family as you would a friend</h3>
<p>If they're not friendly, don't consider them. Renee Burger-McMichael
of Philadelphia once communicated with a woman who wouldn't take time
to answer her questions and instead directed Burger-McMichael back to
her listing.</p>
<p>&quot;You know how you can get a vibe from e-mail?&quot; she said. &quot;She just
did not seem friendly.&quot;</p>
<h3>Cast a wide net</h3>
<p>The fastest way to see how many people want to come to your home is to
make a reverse search. But remember, many potential exchangers don't
enter a desired destination, or they list themselves as &quot;open.&quot;</p>
<p>In that case, go ahead and contact them; you never know who might be
interested in coming to your home.</p>
<p>&quot;They're so excited about what might come in the e-mail they don't
want to limit where they go,&quot; says HomeExchange's George Balen.</p>
<h3>Home exchange companies</h3>
<p>Typically, home-exchange companies allow people to view on-line
listings, but you have to be a member to get contact information. Below
are a few of the many exchange companies.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.homeexchange.com">Home Exchange.com</a>:</em> It has more than
100,000 listings in more than 130 countries; half are in the United States.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.intervac-homeexchange.com/">Intervac USA</a>:</em> Intervac was founded in 1953, and 80 percent are outside the United
States. Intervac has English-speaking representatives in many
countries who can help exchangers with problems.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://peoplelikeus.world/">People Like Us</a>:</em> It claims to be the most-trusted home-exchange group, and people can put up a free trial profile and pay for a membership only when they are able to make an exchange.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://homelink.org/en/">Homelink</a>:</em> It was established in the
United Kingdom in 1953; 70
percent of listings are in Europe. It also has many representatives in other
countries. If you don't find an exchange the first year, the second year
is free.</p>
<p><em>Other exchange organizations:</em>  <a href="http://www.transitionsabroad.com/listings/travel/home_exchanges/home_exchanges.shtml">Transitions
Abroad</a>
magazine includes many stories about home exchanging and lists more
companies.</p>
<h3>Why not a weekend?</h3>
<p>When most people think of exchanging houses, they think of far-flung
destinations — England, France, Florida.</p>
<p>But why not Duluth for the weekend? Or Minocqua?</p>
<p>For one thing, people could use their own cars. They could check each
other out in advance. And they wouldn't have to pay air fare.</p>
<p>In addition, a thriving home-exchange network within a region could stem
the tide of expensive second homes that's edging out mom-and-pop motels
and resorts in such destinations as the North Shore and Door County.</p>
<p>What if people could just exchange homes instead of buying another one?</p>
<p>&quot;I've always wondered about that second-home conundrum,&quot; says Jessica
Jaffe, U.S. representative for Intervac.</p>
<p>&quot;They're so expensive, and you have to commit to one place for the rest
of your life. It makes a lot more sense to me to have flexibility to go
to a lot of different places. Maybe that will be the middle-class
solution to that problem.&quot;</p>
<p>On HomeExchange alone, there are Minnesota houses listed in Brainerd,
Nisswa, Park Rapids and Winona.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, there are homes in the lakes country of Mercer and Boulder
Junction, in Sturgeon Bay and on Lake Michigan in Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Who knows? Maybe their owners would enjoy a little weekend vacation.</p>
