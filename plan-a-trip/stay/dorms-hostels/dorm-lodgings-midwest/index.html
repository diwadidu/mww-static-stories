<h2>In summer, college residence halls are a boon to budget travelers.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_straz_tower.jpg" alt="The Straz Tower dorm at Marquette University." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Marquette University's Straz Tower provides inexpensive dorm rooms on
the edge of downtown Milwaukee.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Until recently, my memories of college dorms mostly involved sloppy
drunks, sloppier roommates and a bathroom shared by the whole floor.</p>
<p>Then my husband and I stayed at Marquette University in Milwaukee. It
was as quiet as a cathedral, and we had a private bath and a panoramic
view of the city from our 17th-floor picture windows.</p>
<p>We got a great deal, which was nice because we like to save money. But
mostly, we stayed at Marquette because it was so convenient, three
blocks from the special bus that takes summer visitors to the lakefront
Henry Maier Festival Park and right on the route that takes baseball
fans to Miller Park on game days.</p>
<p>We also brought our bikes, and we knew we could bring them up to our
room — at a college, nobody bats an eye about that.</p>
<p>We were supposed to stay in the year-round guest wing of Mashuda Hall, a
former hotel that's next to the Pabst Mansion and housed the Beatles
when they played Milwaukee in 1964.</p>
<p>But when we got to Marquette, we found we'd been moved to the 18-story
Straz Tower, which suited us because it's much closer to downtown.</p>
<p>The Straz once was the central branch of the YMCA, so we had access to a
fitness center with a lap pool, indoor running track, racquetball
courts, sauna, steam room and whirlpool.</p>
<p>On the 17th floor, our room had cable TV, microwave, refrigerator,
phone, Internet access, a folder of tourist information and a little
basket of toiletries in the bathroom.</p>
<p>We had a sweeping view of freeways, factories and grain elevators from
our room, spectacular at night, but Steffani King of Louisville, Ky.,
had done even better.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Her top-floor room had a beautiful view of downtown and the landscaped
grounds of the Wisconsin Club, which occupies an ornate French Second
Empire mansion across the street and hosts weddings nearly every
Saturday.</p>
<p>King was on her first solo road trip and had meant to mostly camp her
way west, but then she stumbled across Marquette.</p>
<p>&quot;It's such a cheap room; I could never have found anything else this
nice,&quot; she said. &quot;Although the guy at the front desk is not exactly a
concierge.&quot;</p>
<p>In summer, campus lodgings often are manned by students, and ours
obviously wasn't at the top of his class. He couldn't find our
check-in information, and he didn't know where we should park. We'd also been billed for just one night, but not two.</p>
<p>But everything got straightened out, and we had a great time. There's a festival every
summer weekend in Milwaukee, and the town fills up for such events as
Summerfest and Festa Italiana, both on the lakefront.</p>
<p>Just remember, a college dorm is not a hotel. It's not romantic,
either, because all the beds are twins. But for those who can channel
their inner students, it's a great way to travel.</p>

<h3>Trip tips: Summer stays at colleges</h3>
<p>Below are some of the colleges that open their halls to visitors in
summer. Few colleges advertise; if you want to find out about
availability elsewhere, call and ask.</p>
<p>Some colleges reserve their summer housing for participants in
conferences and other programs but may make it available to others if
it's not filled. Some colleges have a few year-round guest
accommodations.</p>
<p>Some colleges, such as the <a href="https://housing.d.umn.edu/summer-housing/summer-senior-rental-program">University of Minnesota-Duluth</a>, have one- or two-month summer rental programs for seniors, which are very popular with people from southern states.</p>
<h3>Milwaukee</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.marquette.edu/orl/conference/">Marquette University</a> is very
well-located, on the edge of downtown and with good access to public
transportation.</p>
<p>Its <a href="http://www.marquette.edu/orl/conference/straz.shtml">Straz Tower</a>
is three blocks from the special bus that takes summer visitors to the
lakefront Henry Maier Festival Park and right on the Wisconsin Avenue
route that takes baseball fans to Miller Park on game days.</p>
<p>Or ride your bike; it's a college dorm, so you're free to take your
bike up to your room in the elevator. Milwaukee is a great place to
bicycle; see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/Interurban-milwaukee-bike-trails/">Bicycling along Lake
Michigan</a>.</p>
<p>You also can stay a mile farther along Wisconsin Avenue at the
seven-story <a href="http://www.marquette.edu/orl/conference/mashuda.shtml">Mashuda
Hall</a>, a former
hotel where the Beatles stayed after their Milwaukee gig in 1964. It's
next to the Pabst Mansion.</p>
<p>The air-conditioned rooms, all with WiFi, are available from late May to
mid-August, but only if a conference also has booked rooms in one of the
dorms. That's most days, but usually not holiday weekends.</p>
<p>Mashuda Hall also has a guest wing that's open every day during the
academic year. Every room has a microwave, refrigerator and cable TV. To
reserve, call 414-288-7208.</p>

Milwaukee</a> and

<h3>Duluth/Superior</h3>
<p>For Grandma's Marathon festivities in mid-June, three local colleges
pitch in to house the 50,000 spectators and 17,000 runners.</p>
<p>The colleges also are open at other times, and the <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/housing/grandmas/">University of
Minnesota-Duluth</a> and St.
Scholastica both operate popular programs for seniors who leave their
winter homes in Arizona and Florida to spend a cool summer on the shores
of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>For Grandma's, UMD rents double rooms and two-bedroom suites. The rest
of the summer, seniors can rent <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/housing/summer/">furnished
apartments</a> that sleep four and
include phone, utilities and a meal card. Call 218-726-7390.</p>
<p>For Grandma's, the <a href="https://www3.css.edu/reslife/gm/">College of St.
Scholastica</a>, just west of UMD off Skyline Parkway, rents dorm rooms for two, with
bath down the hall, and two- or four-bedroom suites and apartments. Call
218-529-5777.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.uwsuper.edu">University of Wisconsin-Superior</a> rents
rooms during Grandma's and at some other times. Call 715-394-8575.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/best-duluth-minnesota/">Duluth
101</a>.</p>
<h3>Thunder Bay</h3>
<p>Two colleges on the north end of town offer lodgings from May through
mid-August.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lakeheadu.ca/campus-life/conference/tb/accommodations">Lakehead
University</a>
offers pleasant single and double rooms with mini-fridges. Bathrooms are shared, and there's a shared living area with a
kitchenette and large flat-screen TV.</p>
<p>There are also four-bedroom apartments and townhouses with TV and all
appliances and utensils.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/thunder-bay-summer/">Exploring Thunder
Bay</a>.</p>
<h3>Chicago</h3>
<p>Chicago can be very expensive in summer, so campus housing is an
especially good deal.</p>
<p>At Congress and State in the Loop, the 1,700-bed University Center
houses students from Columbia College and DePaul and Roosevelt
universities during the year. In summer, it rents four bedroom, two-bath
apartments and semi-suites, which share a bath with another semi-suite.
Rates include one meal in the dining center.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://universitycenter.com/">University Center</a> also rents
year-round guest suites that have a queen bed, flat-screen TV, kitchen
and bath. Call 312-924-8089.</p>
<p>Just west of downtown in the University Village neighborhood, the
<a href="https://housing.uic.edu/affiliate/guesthousing/">University of Illinois-Chicago</a>
rents apartments mainly to students who have come to Chicago on
internships, but it also will rent to others. Call 312-355-6317.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/cheap-chicago/">Cheap
Chicago</a> and other
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/">Chicago
stories</a>.</p>
<h3>Traverse City</h3>
<p>This beach town near Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is very
popular in summer.</p>
<p>To stay on a budget, reserve a room at <a href="https://www.nmc.edu/student-services/housing/summer-housing/index.html">Northwestern Michigan
College</a>. It offers single and double rooms and family suites.</p>
<p>It's at the foot of the Old Mission Peninsula, between the two arms of
Grand Traverse Bay.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">The good life in Traverse
City</a>.</p>
<h3>Decorah, Iowa</h3>
<p>In this northeast Iowa town, <a href="https://www.luther.edu/conferences-events/nordic-fest-housing/">Luther
College</a>
helps house the 60,000 people who flood into town for Nordic Fest in
late July. The college will rent summer accommodations at other times if
local hotels are full.</p>
<p>For more about Nordic Fest, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/nordic-fest-decorah/">Nordic
nirvana</a>.</p>
<h3>Staying in hostels</h3>
<p>Hostels are another low-cost accommodation; there are several in Chicago.</p>
<p>For information on hostels in general, check <a href="https://www.hihostels.com/">Hostelling
International</a> or <a href="http://www.hostelworld.com">Hostel
World</a>, which includes ratings from guests
and features on hostels and towns around the world.</p>
