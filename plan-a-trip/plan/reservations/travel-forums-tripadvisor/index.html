<p>If you're planning a vacation, remember this: The people have spoken.</p>
<p>They've spoken about the meals they ate, hotels they slept in, tours
they took, attractions they visited and people they met. They've gone
on and on about beaches and bars and bathrooms and what they had for
breakfast.</p>
<p>It's the kind of thing that bores their friends to death — and yet
strangers around the world are eating it up.</p>
<p>Every day, millions log onto TripAdvisor and other online guides,
reading what other people have to say about vacation destinations.</p>
<p>Now any Joe Schmo can find someone who actually wants to hear about the
great time he had and see those great pictures he took — and he's
happy to oblige.</p>
<h3>Poison pen</h3>
<p>Sometimes, they come as a shock. Zig Gudrais of the Candlelight Inn in
Red Wing, Minn., hadn't even heard of TripAdvisor until a disgruntled
guest wrote a bad review in September 2005 and e-mailed him a link.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>She'd stayed over her anniversary and accepted the inn's free
anniversary package of a dozen roses, a bottle of champagne and two
specially engraved glasses, Gudrais says.</p>
<p>She and her husband slept in their room, ate breakfast the next day,
took their roses and glasses home and then asked for their money back,
specifically citing the breakfast prepared by his wife, Lynette, a food
columnist for the Red Wing Republican Eagle.</p>
<p>Gudrais offered a certificate for another night's stay, but that
wasn't good enough.</p>
<p>&quot;She said, 'Give me a full refund or I'll write a bad review on
TripAdvisor,' and I didn't care, because I didn't even know what it
was,&quot; Gudrais says.</p>
<p>Chris Brown Mahoney of Red Wing's Moondance Inn got several excellent
reviews from guests. But then she, too, was threatened by a guest who
said she was unsatisfied.</p>
<p>&quot;She said, 'If I don't get a full refund, I'm going to be writing on
TripAdvisor and everywhere else,' and she did,&quot; Mahoney said.
&quot;Honestly, it was the worst experience we've ever had.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mahoney uses TripAdvisor herself when planning a vacation.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/sheboygan_blue_harbor_resort.jpg" alt="Hotel Chequamegon in Ashland." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;I never put too much stock in it,&quot; she says. &quot;When I look at a
property, if there's only one or two reviews, I don't pay too much
attention, unless both are horrible. I guess I'm looking for numbers;
if nine out of 10 people like it, that's great.&quot;</p>
<h3>Reading between the lines</h3>
<p>I use TripAdvisor, too, especially when I'm going to an unfamiliar
destination. Like Olympic ice-skating judges, I throw out the highest
score and the lowest score and average out the rest.</p>
<p>So far, it's worked pretty well. Before I bought a cheap air-hotel
package to Mazatlan, I quickly checked reviews of the hotel, the Playa
Mazatlan.</p>
<p>As usual, Americans were complaining about hard beds and air
conditioning; I ignored that, giving more weight to location,
cleanliness and hospitality. Some of the guests mentioned noise from
nearby bars; I brought ear plugs. I went with a girlfriend, and we
adored the Playa.</p>
<p>Reviews also can tell you where <em>not</em> to stay. Where do the party
animals go? The pampered princesses? The snobs?</p>
<p>Those are the places I cross off my list. I don't want to rub shoulders
with the likes of the American man who sneered about the Mexican staff
at his hotel: &quot;They need to remember that they're the overhead and
we're the profit.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Only a few of the comments are truly appalling. Some people are whiners
and cranks, but most try to be helpful to others.</p>
<p>When I planned a trip to Puerto Vallarta, I was almost ready to reserve
at a small hotel next to a quiet park, until TripAdvisor members
informed me the park was being torn up for a parking lot.</p>
<p>That's information you won't find in printed guidebooks, which are
more than a year out of date by the time they hit bookstores.</p>
<p>Eventually, I settled on a hillside B&amp;B that guests loved despite the
steep climb required to get to it. Reviews that clearly explain such
potential drawbacks actually help an inn by keeping out guests who would
be upset by it and then tell all their friends - or the whole world,
these days.</p>
<p>Forewarned is forearmed. When I stayed at the newly opened Casa Mexicana
in Cozumel, I liked it very much but was sure that many tourists would
kvetch about its lack of a real pool and distance from a beach.</p>
<p>Nope. It's one of the reviewers' favorites. People who went there knew
about the small pool, and they valued the place for its breakfast,
location, cleanliness and friendly staff, just as I did.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/p/ephraim_pioneer_lane.jpg" alt="Lodgings at Pioneer Lane in Ephraim." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Go figure — sometimes, tourists are exactly as smart as they should
be.</p>
<h3>Fake reviews</h3>
<p>And other times, reviewers aren't tourists at all. As TripAdvisor
reviews have become more influential, some properties have planted
glowing reviews about their properties.</p>
<p>Regulars on the TripAdvisor forums say that these so-called reviewers
often can be identified because they have joined recently and posted
only one review.</p>
<p>Be skeptical of all over-the-top &quot;reviews&quot; and suspicious of people
who repeatedly drop the name of a certain property or who give off-topic
answers to queries: for example, giving the name of a resort in
northwest Wisconsin when the query has asked for resorts in southeast
Wisconsin.</p>
<h3>Disgruntled guests</h3>
<p>Over the years, I've noted an interesting phenomenon: The more money
people spend on an inn, and the more entrenched its reputation, the less
likely they are to tell their friends if it's disappointing.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>For one thing, it's usually their friends who recommended the place;
for the other, no one likes to admit he made a poor choice.</p>
<p>The Internet is a different matter. Even the Old Rittenhouse Inn in
Bayfield, Wis., perhaps Wisconsin's best-known B&amp;B, has found itself on
the receiving end of a poison pen.</p>
<p>&quot;It's interesting; they're so polarized,&quot; he says. &quot;They either
love you and rave or hate you and rant. It's painful.&quot;</p>
<p>In Stillwater, Minn., Tom and Sandy Lynum have enjoyed good reviews for
their William Sauntry Mansion. They also use TripAdvisor when they
travel, sometimes ducking into Internet cafes to check reviews and
cross-reference with printed guidebooks.</p>
<p>Tom Lynum says they've found several reviews that were unfair, such as
one of a hotel that he later learned had been filled with 11-year-old
soccer players while the guest was there.</p>
<p>&quot;It takes an experienced traveler to be able to drill down and really
figure out what's going on,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>TripAdvisor promotes its &quot;unbiased opinions,&quot; but no opinion is
unbiased. And there's nothing scientific about its reviews; one
innkeeper can encourage satisfied guests to file a review, and his inn
will seem more popular than others.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinac_grand_hotel_west.jpg" alt="The Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Still, it's a great tool for the masses. Once, the hotels, restaurants
and tourist attractions that spent the most money advertising and hired
the best marketing consultants could pretty much count on getting the
most business; that's no longer true.</p>
<p>People are talking to each other all over the world. For example, a
57-year-old single woman from Cape Cod posted &quot;A Great Big Thank
You!!!&quot; to TripAdvisor members who helped her plan her first trip to
Paris: &quot;I truly would not have had the confidence to move foward
without you . . . You are all a blessing and I thank you all soooo
much.&quot;</p>
<p>TripAdvisor's Yucatan Peninsula forum alone has hundreds of thousands
of posts, covering everything from the best snorkeling sites to moped
rentals, which is good; I suspect that people who ignore guidebook
warnings about mopeds will pay more attention to postings from 20
members who have witnessed accidents.</p>
<p>There are local forums, too; members on the Minnesota forum ask each
other where they should spend spring break, whether April skiing at
Lutsen is any good, which waterparks are best and where they can find a
good fish fry.</p>
<p>It's the ultimate free marketplace of ideas, and sometimes all that
information can be overwhelming. But people who take the time to sift
through it can find gold.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a little ambivalent, but I welcome it,&quot; Tom Lynum says. &quot;At the
end of the day, people who look at those things can get a good sense of
what something really is.&quot;</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Planning a vacation online</h3>
<p>Online travel guides and forums are growing. Just remember, they're
there to make money for their sponsors, so use normal consumer
skepticism. For big-ticket items, such as a weeklong hotel stay, try to
cross-reference with other sources.</p>
<p><em>Search-engine guides:</em> Expedia's TripAdvisor is biggest and easiest to
navigate. Once registered, you're a member and can send and receive
messages from other members and participate on forums.</p>
<p>It also allows members to share photos and videos, and there are pages
of background information. When reading reviews of hotels, be sure to
notice the additional tabs for B&amp;Bs/Inns and Other Lodgings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> covers larger cities and contains reviews of
lodgings and restaurants as well as other businesses. However, some
businesses have filed suit against the company, claiming it asks for
money to delete negative reviews. Yelp says it doesn't.</p>
<p>For user reviews of restaurants, check
<a href="http://www.chowhound.com">Chowhound</a> and <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com">Urban
Spoon</a>.</p>
<p><em>Guidebook forums:</em> Your favorite guide likely is online and includes
traveler forums or message boards. Among them are Fodors.com,
Frommers.com, Lonelyplanet.com and RickSteves.com.</p>
<p><em>Local forums:</em> These are the best places to find up-to-date
information, because many of the participants live in the destination.
Type the destination name and &quot;forum&quot; or &quot;bulletin board&quot; into a
search engine.</p>
<p><em>Paid listing services:</em> Businesses pay to be listed on such services as
Citysearch.com, Lanierbb.com, BBonline and Bedandbreakfast.com, so
information is not comprehensive.</p>
