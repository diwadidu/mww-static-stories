<h2>Here's a guide to the lodgings, campsites and permits you should nail down early.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_art_fair.jpg" alt="Art on the Square in Madison." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Two art fairs draw more than 200,000 people to Madison in July.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the Upper Midwest, travel can be competitive.</p>
<p>Many festivals are so big and so fun that everyone wants to go. If you
do, too, you'll have to act fast to stay ahead of the crowds.</p>
<p>And sometimes, you also need to know when <em>not</em>
to visit a certain area, so you can avoid
sold-out hotels or sky-high rates.</p>
<p>Planning to take the kids on a field trip to Chicago's famous museums?
If you settle on early August, when
300,000 music fans will be in town for the rock festival Lollapalooza,
you won't be able to find a hotel.</p>
<p>If you'll be within 60 miles of Oshkosh, Wis., in late July
— and that includes Green Bay and the
Lake Michigan shore — you'll be competing for rooms with the 300,000
people who go to EEA AirVenture.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>And always book early for holidays that fall on weekends — such as the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/holidays/best-fourth-july-fests/">Fourth of July</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/halloween/">Halloween</a>, both on Tuesday in 2023
— and also for those that create long weekends.</p>
<p>The first half of January is the best time to go after hard-to-get
reservations at annual festivals.</p>
<p>Most people rebook their lodgings as they're leaving after a big
festival. But often deposits are due in January, and there's always
someone who doesn't send one and forfeits the room. So be poised to snap
it up.</p>
<p>The smaller the town, the harder it is to get a reservation. However,
new Airbnbs are popping up all the time in small towns, and some people
forget to check for them.</p>
<p>There are quite a few in Decorah, Iowa, where 75,000 people pour into
town for <a href="http://www.nordicfest.com/">Nordic Fest</a> in July, and hotel
rooms are so hard to get for that weekend that a reservation is
practically a family heirloom.</p>
<p>It's the same thing in Bayfield, Wis., where <a href="https://www.bayfield.org/bayfield-apple-festival/">Apple
Festival</a>
on the first full weekend of October brings 60,000 people into the tiny
northern Wisconsin village of 500.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/p/ephraim_edgewater.jpg" alt="Waterfront hotel in Ephraim." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
For summer, book lodgings in Door County far in advance.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>One of the hardest reservations to get is a room in Duluth for
<a href="http://grandmasmarathon.com/">Grandma's Marathon</a>
in June, when 14,700
runners and 30,000 to 40,000 spectators fill the town.</p>
<p>Hotels fill up the day after the previous year's race, and, with
hundreds of people calling every month, few hotels bother to keep
waiting lists.</p>
<p>Airbnbs also fill immediately. But many have three- or six-month
reservation windows, so check as soon as their window opens.</p>
<p>And in February, many people who reserved last June will find out they
didn't get into the race, and they'll start to cancel. That's the time
to call hotels, as well as during the third week of May, when 30-day
cancellation policies go into effect.</p>
<p>The best time to reserve a room for any big event is on the day after it
ends on the previous year.</p>
<p>And look for newly opened properties that haven't been advertised much.
Ask the staff at visitors bureaus if there are — or will be — new
places to stay.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/hotels-motels/finding-places-to-stay/">How to find a great place to
stay</a>.</p>

Chicago's Blues Festival draws half a million people to the city in
June.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Campsites and cabins</h3>
<p>To reserve the choicest <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/camper-cabins-midwest/">camper
cabins</a> and lodges in
Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Michigan state parks, be online or at the
phone <em>120 days to a year</em> in advance.</p>
<p>The best <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-midwest-state-parks/">campsites in state
parks</a> also go
fast. For Minnesota campsites, <em>120 days</em> in advance; Iowa campsites,
call <em>three months</em> in advance; for Michigan campsites, <em>six months</em> in
advance; and for Wisconsin campsites, <em>11 months</em> in advance.</p>
<p>For summer weekends, you'll increase your odds if you also reserve for
Thursday night; then, you can make your call a day earlier. You must use
the site on Thursday, however, or you'll forfeit the entire stay.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The best time to reserve a cabin for a week at a popular <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/choosing-lake-resort/">lake
resort</a>,
especially for a group, is a year in advance. Call the Monday after that
week ends, because most — but not all — families reserve for the
next year before they leave.</p>
<p>If you can't plan that early, look in winter or spring.</p>
<h3>Popular destinations</h3>
<p>Reserve as early as you can for summer weekends in <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-lake-michigan/">beach towns on Lake
Michigan</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a> and summer and fall
weekends in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/best-duluth-minnesota/">Duluth</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/best-door-county-vacation/">Door County</a>.</p>
<p>It's the same for fall weekends at <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/north-shore-lodgings/">North Shore
cabins</a> in
Minnesota and inns along the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/">Mississippi
River</a>.</p>
<p>In
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/">Chicago</a>, hotel rates depend on how much competition there is on a weekend.</p>
<p>The summer festivals draw a lot of people, but many are locals or
day-trippers. For big conventions, however, everybody needs a hotel
room.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/o/boundary_waters_gagner.jpg" alt="Canoeing in the Boundary Waters." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Lauren Gagner</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The best permits for entry into the Boundary Waters go fastest.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Before booking a non-refundable fare to Chicago, first check its
<a href="https://conventioncalendar.com/chicago/mccormick-place">convention
calendar</a>
to see if a huge convention is in town. If so, rooms will be very
expensive, if available.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/christmas-chicago/">Christmas shoppers</a>
might think the week after Thanksgiving would be a good time to visit,
but 55,000 members of the Radiological Society of North America are in
town then.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/hotels-motels/best-hotels-chicago/">Where to stay in
Chicago</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to take Amtrak or the Megabus, book as soon as possible; the
cheapest seats sell first.</p>
<h2>Reserving for 2023</h2>
<p>This month-by-month guide will help you nail down the most-coveted and
hardest-to-get reservations.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/l/illgen_cabin_winter.jpg" alt="Illgen Falls cabin." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Illgen Falls.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><em>JANUARY</em></h3>
<p>January is a good time to reserve for any place you want to visit this
year.</p>
<p>Wisconsin's state parks also have nine <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/camping/cabin.html">cabins for people with
disabilities</a>, $30.
They're very popular and can be reserved starting <em>Jan. 10</em> for the
following year. Reservations are taken by individual parks.</p>
<p>Reserve early for the best choice of entry permits into the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/superior/specialplaces/?cid=fseprd555184">Boundary
Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness</a>. Reservations can be made starting the <em>last Wednesday in January</em> at
<a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/superior/specialplaces/?cid=fseprd555184">Recreation.
gov</a>, 877-444-6777.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boundary-waters-tips/">Minnesota's Boundary
Waters</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-lake-michigan/">Michigan state parks</a>, campsites can be reserved six months in advance. At some campgrounds,
particularly those on the beach-lined west coast of Lake Michigan, 100
percent of sites can be reserved, so it's crucial to reserve early.</p>
<p>At <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State
Park</a>
on the Upper Peninsula, 80 percent of sites can be reserved.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_bicycling_skyline.jpg" alt="Bicycling in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Tourists as well as locals flock to Chicago's lakefront in summer.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/michigan-state-park-cabins/">Cabins in Michigan
parks</a> also
are coveted and can be booked a year in advance. Call 800-447-2757 or
<a href="http://www.midnrreservations.com">reserve online</a>.</p>
<p>Iowa also has a nice variety of well-priced <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/iowa-state-park-cabins/">rustic and modern cabins in
state parks</a>.
They book a year in advance.</p>
<h3><em>FEBRUARY</em></h3>
<p>On Feb. 6, the <a href="https://housing.d.umn.edu/summer-housing/grandmas-marathon">University of
Minnesota-Duluth</a>
begins taking reservations for dorm rooms and apartments for Grandma's
Marathon. The <a href="https://www3.css.edu/reslife/gm/">College of St.
Scholastica</a> also rents dorm rooms, with reservations starting March 1.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/minnesota-ski-lodges-wisconsin/">Cross-country ski
lodges</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/ski-alpine-minnesota-wisconsin/">alpine ski
resorts</a> book up early for Presidents Day weekend.</p>
<p>On Wisconsin's Chequamegon Bay, the folksy <a href="http://www.batb.org/">Book Across the
Bay</a> ski and snowshoe benefit race/tour, between
Ashland and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/book-across-bay/">Washburn</a>
on President's Day weekend fills up both towns.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/michigan_holland_camper_cabin.jpg" alt="A camper cabin at Holland State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The beachfront cabins in Michigan's Holland State Park are extremely
popular.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The <a href="http://www.birkie.com">American Birkebeiner</a> between Cable and
Hayward, North America's largest cross-country ski marathon, will fill
northwest Wisconsin with 35,000 spectators watching 13,500 skiers
<em><strong>Feb. 22-26.</strong></em></p>
<p>In Iowa, campsites can be
<a href="https://iowastateparks.reserveamerica.com/">reserved</a> three months in
advance at 877-427-2757. Only 50 percent of campsites can be reserved.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, campsites can be
<a href="https://reservemn.usedirect.com/MinnesotaWeb/">reserved</a> 120 days in
advance.</p>
<p>Split Rock, which has a very scenic location on the North Shore but not
many sites, is the hardest-to-get camping reservation, followed by
Temperance River, Tettegouche, Itasca, Gooseberry Falls, McCarthy Beach
(on the Iron Range, near Hibbing), Bear Head Lake (near Ely), Judge C.R.
Magney, Jay Cooke and Cascade River.</p>
<h3><em>MARCH</em></h3>
<p>Reserve early for spring-break trips to the <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/dells-water-parks/">indoor water parks of the
Wisconsin
Dells</a>.
The three best and biggest are the Kalahari, Great Wolf Lodge and
Wilderness Resort.</p>
<p>The weeks before Easter, which is <strong>April 9</strong> in 2023, are busiest.</p>
<p>Many other hotels around the region also have <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/midwest-water-parks/">indoor water
parks</a>
that children will think are plenty of fun.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Going to Chicago by train is a great spring-break trip. The cheapest
seats sell first on <a href="http://www.amtrak.com">Amtrak</a>, so reserve as
early as possible.</p>
<p>If you'd like to <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-minneapolis-suburbs/">camp in a Twin Cities park
reserve</a>, especially over
a holiday weekend, watch for the opening of the reservation windows in
January and March.</p>
<h3><em>APRIL</em></h3>
<p>This is the time to reserve accommodations for <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/midwest-summer-festivals/">big summer
festivals</a>, if
you haven't already.</p>
<p>In the northeast Iowa town of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/decorah-iowa-norwegian-heritage/">Decorah</a>, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/nordic-fest-decorah/">Nordic Fest</a>,
<em>July 27-29,</em> draws 75,000 people to the town of 8,500. A reservation
in one of the town's motels or B&amp;Bs is nearly impossible to get, so most
people camp or stay in private homes or rooms at <a href="https://www.luther.edu/">Luther
College</a>.</p>
<p>For reservations for air-conditioned lodgings at Luther, call
563-387-1538. Eventually, people book rooms as far away as Rochester or
La Crosse.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/bayfield_apple_float.jpg" alt="An apple-orchard float in Bayfield." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><em>MAY</em></h3>
<p>If you want to go to the annual <a href="https://greattaste.org/">Great Taste of the
Midwest</a> in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/madison/">Madison</a>, the second-longest running
craft-beer festival in North America, you'll need to send in a mail
order for tickets or show up in person the <em>first Sunday of</em> <em>May</em> at
one of various vendors in Madison.</p>
<p>Only 5,000 tickets are sold for the Aug. 12 event, held in Olin-Turville
Park.</p>
<p>In May, the big festivals begin. One of the best is <a href="https://www.visitpella.com/tulip-time-activities/">Tulip
Time</a> in Pella, Iowa,
which brings 150,000 people to the town of 10,000. It's <em>May 4-6,</em>
timed to coincide with the blooming of 250,000 tulips.</p>
<p>In Holland, Mich., <a href="http://www.tuliptime.com/">Tulip Time</a> spreads over
two weekends, <em>May 6-14.</em></p>
<p>The annual <a href="http://flwright.org/wrightplus">Wright Plus Housewalk</a> is
<em>May 20</em> in <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/wright-oak-park-chicago/">Oak Park,
Ill.</a>, with interior tours of private homes, many designed by Frank Lloyd
Wright. Tickets sell out far in advance.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/b/oberg_red_camera.jpg" alt="Photographing fall colors on Oberg Mountain." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Minnesota's North Shore, everyone hopes to catch fall colors like
these around Oberg Mountain.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><em>JUNE</em></h3>
<p>In Wisconsin, campsites can be
<a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/camping">reserved</a> 11 months in
advance, 888-947-2757, so now is the time to think about reserving for
<em>next</em> year. In 2023, Memorial Day is May
29, the Fourth of July is on a Tuesday and Labor Day is Sept. 4.</p>
<p>The most in-demand campsites are in Peninsula and Devil's Lake state
parks and the Crystal Lake and Clear Lake campgrounds of Northern
Highland-American Legion State Forest near Minocqua.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grandmasmarathon.com">Grandma's Marathon</a> in Duluth is <em>June
17.</em>  Many hotels have three-night minimums, and most raise rates for
the weekend. Check in February and May for cancellations.</p>
<p>In Chicago, the free <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/chicago_blues_festival.html">Blues
Festival</a>
on the second weekend of June draws more than half a million people.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.summerfest.com">Summerfest</a>, which Milwaukee calls &quot;the
world's largest music festival,&quot; brings nearly a million people to the
lakefront festival grounds. It's <em>June 22-24,</em> <em>June 29-July 1 and July
6-8.</em> Hotels fill, but there are rooms available at the very nice
<a href="https://www.marquette.edu/conference-services/straz.php">dorms</a> of
Marquette University.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/traverse_city_cherry_contest.jpg" alt="Cherry pie-eating in Traverse City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Traverse City Tourism</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Cherry pie-eating contests are part of Traverse City's National Cherry
Festival.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then there are Milwaukee's <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/summer-milwaukee/">big heritage
festivals</a>,
starting with <a href="http://www.pridefest.com">PrideFest</a> and <a href="http://www.milwaukeescottishfest.com">Scottish
Fest</a> in June and ending with
<a href="http://www.indiansummer.org">Indian Summer Festival</a> the weekend after
Labor Day; in between, there's <a href="http://www.polishfest.org/">Polish Fest</a>, <a href="http://www.easttown.com">Bastille Days</a>, <a href="http://www.germanfest.com">German
Fest</a>, <a href="http://www.irishfest.com">Irish
Fest</a> and <a href="http://www.mexicanfiesta.org">Mexican
Fiesta</a>.</p>
<h3><em>JULY</em></h3>
<p>The <em>Fourth of July</em> is busy everywhere. It will be especially busy in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Traverse
City</a>
on Lake Michigan, where 500,000 people come for <a href="http://www.cherryfestival.org/">National Cherry
Festival</a> <em>July 1-8.</em></p>
<p>At beach towns everywhere, weekends will be jam-packed from now through
the middle of August.</p>
<p>The free music-and-food festival <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/taste_of_chicago.html">Taste of
Chicago</a>
on the weekend after the Fourth draws big crowds.</p>
<p>In Madison, the <a href="https://www.mmoca.org/events/art-fair-on-the-square-2023/">Art Fair on the
Square</a>
and Art Fair Off the Square draw more than 200,000 people to the
Capitol/State Street/Monona Terrace area. They're <em>July 8-9.</em></p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinac_bridge2.jpg" alt="The Mackinac Bridge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Labor Day is the only day people can walk on the Mackinac Bridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In eastern Wisconsin, the <a href="https://www.eaa.org/airventure">EEA
AirVenture</a> <em>July 24-30</em> fills up so
many hotel rooms it may even affect people doing the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-circle-tour-highlights/">Lake Michigan
Circle
Tour</a>,
on which stops in beach towns should be reserved far in advance.</p>
<p>This is the time to start looking for a <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/choosing-lake-resort/">lake
resort</a> for next
year, though some resorts have last-minute cancellations. If possible,
drop by resorts in person while traveling in the area this summer.</p>
<h3><em>AUGUST</em></h3>
<p>In the far northeast corner of Minnesota, it's notoriously hard to find
close-in rooms for the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grpo/planyourvisit/aboutrendezvousdaysandpowwow.htm">Grand Portage Rendezvous and
Powwow</a>,
when re-enactors from across the
continent converge on <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/visiting-grand-portage/">Grand Portage National
Monument</a>.
It's <em>Aug. 11-12</em> in 2023.</p>
<p>In Duluth, the <a href="http://www.bayfrontblues.com/">Bayfront Blues Festival</a>
is the biggest of many music weekends, <em>Aug. 11-13.</em></p>

<h3><em>SEPTEMBER</em></h3>
<p>On <em>Sept. 1,</em> reserve a <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/minnesota-state-park-cabins/">cabin or
guesthouse</a>
in Minnesota state parks for New Year's Eve, a Sunday that will be
part of a long weekend. In Tettegouche State Park, the four cabins on
Mic Mac Lake and the Illgen Falls Cabin are in particular demand for the
holidays.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/reserve-faq/index.html">Reservations</a>
for cabins, suites and guesthouses in Minnesota state parks can be made
120 days in advance online or at 866-857-2757, toll-free in the United
States and Canada.</p>
<p>Lodgings in Minnesota state parks also are in demand for the long Martin
Luther King weekend.</p>
<p>In Chicago, <a href="http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/dca/supp_info/chicago_jazz_festival.html">Jazz
Festival</a>
draws 300,000 people over Labor Day weekend.</p>
<p>The Labor Day <a href="http://www.mightymac.org/bridgewalk.htm">Bridge Walk</a>
over the Mackinac Bridge, the third-longest suspension bridge in the
world, fills lodgings within a 50- to 100-mile radius of St. Ignace and
Mackinaw City, Mich., and especially <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/best-sights-mackinac-island/">Mackinac
Island</a>.
It's <em>Sept. 4.</em></p>
<h3><em>OCTOBER</em></h3>
<p>In <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/cruises-in-lacrosse/">La Crosse</a>,
<a href="http://www.oktoberfestusa.com/">Oktoberfest</a> draws crowds to the banks
of the Mississippi <em>Sept. 28-30.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bayfield.org/bayfield-apple-festival/">Apple
Festival</a> in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/bayfield-summer-wisconsin/">Bayfield</a>
fills the Wisconsin village on Lake Superior to bursting; people stay as
far away as Duluth. It's <em>Oct. 6-8.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="http://fallarttour.com/">Fall Art Tour</a> in southwest Wisconsin
<em>Oct. 20-22</em> has become extremely popular, with many devoted customers
returning year after year. Artists open their studios in and around
Mineral Point, Spring Green and Baraboo, with shoppers taking in the
fall scenery between stops.</p>
<p>Accommodations for <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/door-county-fall/">fall in Door
County</a> are in high
demand. Leaf color stays beautiful through the third week of October.</p>
<p>Reserve as soon as possible for <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-colors-north-shore/">fall-color
weekends</a> on the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/">North Shore</a>. For peak inland
color, aim for the last weekend of September; for peak color along the
shore, the first weekend in October.</p>
<p>Because of the Education Minnesota teacher conference, Minnesota
schoolchildren have a four-day weekend <em>Oct. 19-22,</em> and every room is
reserved on the North Shore. Indoor water parks in the <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/dells-water-parks/">Wisconsin
Dells</a>
also are popular.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/halloween/">Halloween events and ghost tours</a>
book up early, especially the weekend before. Our pick for a great
Halloween getaway:
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/halloween/chicago-halloween-festivals/">Chicago</a>, which adores the holiday; be sure to bring a costume.</p>
<h3><em>NOVEMBER</em></h3>
<p>This is a quiet month for festivals, but not on stormy Lake Superior.
This year, the annual beacon-lighting at <a href="http://www.mnhs.org/splitrock/">Split Rock
Lighthouse</a> on Minnesota's North Shore,
commemorating the <em>Nov. 10</em> loss of the crew of the Edmund Fitzgerald,
is on a Wednesday.</p>

In May, Pella's Tulip Time brings 150,000 people to a town of 10,000.

<p>Many people like to reserve a cabin or villa on Minnesota's North Shore
to watch the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/north-shore-shipwrecks/">gales of
November</a> or fix
Thanksgiving dinner <em>Nov. 23.</em></p>

cabins</a>. For

<p>Holiday festivities get going in earnest the weekend after Thanksgiving;
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/holidays/holiday-festivals/">Great holiday
festivals</a>.</p>
<h3><em>DECEMBER</em></h3>
<p>This is the month to shop.
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/christmas-chicago/">Chicago</a> is full of
holiday shoppers, many of whom come for the open-air
<a href="http://www.christkindlmarket.com">Christkindlmarket</a> in Daley Plaza,
which starts on Thanksgiving and runs through Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>Hard-core shoppers should go the first weekend of December so they also
can hit the annual One of a Kind fine-arts sale at the Merchandise Mart.</p>
