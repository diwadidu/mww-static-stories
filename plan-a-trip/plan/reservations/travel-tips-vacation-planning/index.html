<p>We get a lot of questions at MidwestWeekends from people planning
vacations.</p>
<p>We're glad to help, because we believe in planning. Spontaneity is a
wonderful thing, but it's risky in summer, when the rest of the world
also is on vacation.</p>
<p>Most common questions: When is the <a href="/plan-a-trip/plan/reservations/best-time-travel-midwest/">best
time</a> to take a summer vacation?  How can
I find a good <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/choosing-lake-resort/">lake
resort</a> ? What
should I <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/cabin-packing-list/">bring to a rented
cabin</a> ?</p>
<p>Having made most of the mistakes a traveler can make, I'll pass on what
I know.</p>
<p>Basically, the earlier you plan, the better. You can wait until the last
minute, but you may not be able to get the tickets you want, and
lodgings likely will be the cheapest (that is, the worst) and the most
expensive places, if any are available at all.</p>
<p>Here are 10 of the best strategies to use while planning a trip.</p>
<p>For more help planning trips, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/plan/reservations/guide-to-MidwestWeekends/">How to use
MidwestWeekends.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1. Make reservations, especially for Saturday nights</strong> .
I had to learn this the hard way,
sleeping in the car when every single hotel room along I-80 in Nevada
was filled by a big festival.</p>
<p>And don't think you can forgo a reservation in a small town that's not a
big tourist destination — the smaller the town, the faster its hotel
rooms are filled by a big wedding or family reunion.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong>2. Plan around festivals</strong> . Make sure there isn't a giant
festival going on in your destination when you want to be there. In
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/best-duluth-minnesota/">Duluth</a>, for
example, that's almost every weekend in summer, especially Grandma's
Marathon the third weekend of June.</p>
<p>And before booking fares to Chicago, check its <a href="https://conventioncalendar.com/chicago">convention
calendar</a> to see if a huge
convention is in town; if so, rooms will be very expensive.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/plan/reservations/best-midwest-events/">Serious reservations</a>.</p>
<p><strong>3. Stay at a ski resort in summer</strong> . In summer, alpine ski resorts
offer some of the best deals, because people forget about them.</p>
<p>For example, if you'd like to stay on Lake Michigan but all of the
beach towns are booked, consider staying at the Boyne Mountain or Boyne
Highlands near Charlevoix or Crystal Mountain near Sleeping Bear Dunes
National Lakeshore.</p>
<p>If you'd like to stay on Minnesota's North Shore of Lake Superior,
stay at Caribou Highlands or Eagle Ridge resorts on Lutsen Mountains.
They have all the amenities of a fancy resort, except with a pool
instead of a lake.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_bean_cameras.jpg" alt="Tourists at Cloud Gate in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On holiday weekends, get a hotel bargain and head over to see the
popular Cloud Gate sculpture in Chicago's Millennium Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong>4. If hotel rooms are sold out, look for a cottage</strong> ,
<strong>house, room or even hostel</strong> . Don't
think you have to stay in a hotel — during peak times, when hotel
rates are highest, a vacation rental often is a better deal, especially
when you have more than two or three people in your group.</p>
<p>The lodgings section of every tourism site has a &quot;Vacation rentals&quot;
or &quot;Cottages and cabins&quot; category. For example, hotel rooms on
Duluth's Canal Park zoom past $200 in summer, but for little more than
that, you can get your own one-of-a-kind cottage.</p>
<p>Or stay in a <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/dorms-hostels/dorm-lodgings-midwest/">college dorm</a>, especially in Milwaukee, or a
<a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/dorms-hostels/hostels-minnesota-wisconsin-chicago/">hostel</a>, especially in Chicago and Madison. For the ultimate deal, <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/dorms-hostels/home-exchange/">trade
houses</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5. Get a discount</strong> . A lot of people have
AAA or AARP cards and forget to use them, thereby losing the 10 percent
discount many hotels offer. The AAA card also gets you 10 percent off
Amtrak fares and discounts on many attractions.</p>
<p>You'll have to watch for other discounts, but it takes only a little
effort these days to save a lot of money.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Before reserving a hotel room, see what the rates are at such sites as
Orbitz, Expedia, Travelocity, Hotels and Hotwire. For a rock-bottom
price, use
<a href="https://midwestweekends.com/plan_a_trip/stay/hotels_motels/priceline_hotel_deals.html">Priceline</a>, though you'll get the best deals off-peak.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://www.retailmenot.com/">RetailMeNot</a>, you can shave a few
bucks more off your deals at Orbitz, Travelocity, Amtrak, Megabus and
many hotels, airlines and rental-car agencies.</p>
<p>If you know you're going to a certain city, sign up in advance for its
daily <a href="http://www.groupon.com">Groupon</a> or <a href="http://www.livingsocial.com">Living
Social</a> deals.</p>
<p>In Chicago, <a href="http://www.brokehipster.com/">Broke Hipster</a> lists what's
&quot;free and ridiculously cheap.&quot; <a href="http://www.couponsherpa.com/printable-coupons/category/restaurant-printable-coupons/">Coupon
Sherpa</a>
has printable coupons for fast-food restaurants.</p>
<p>If you know you want to go to a certain resort or use a certain airline,
sign up for its email specials in advance.</p>
<p>Get an <a href="http://www.entertainment.com">Entertainment book</a> for your
destination; they include many 2-for-1 specials. They list at $35 but
drop to $9.99 by June.</p>

When renting a cabin, the rule is that whatever you need but didn't
bring is what it won't have.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you're a member of public radio or some other arts organization,
check your benefits; if you have a MemberCard, you can get many 2-for-1
deals.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.airfarewatchdog.com/">AirFareWatchdog</a> lists the cheapest
flights from your home aiport. And sign up for the weekly deals at
TravelZoo and <a href="http://www.kayak.com/deals">Kayak</a>, which cover the
world but occasionally show good domestic deals.</p>
<p>For other ploys, see our <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/">Cheap
Trips</a> stories.</p>
<p><strong>6. Bring what you need</strong> . First, make a
list so you don't forget something obvious — like your passport, if
you're going on the Circle Tour of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Rented housekeeping cabins are tricky, because each one requires you to
bring different things. But there are a few constants. No. 1 on my
personal packing list is a decent chopping knife, because cabins rarely
have one.</p>
<p>No. 2 is a reading light. Only the humble motel can be counted on to put
a light on each side of the bed; B&amp;Bs are the worst offenders.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/classic-cabins/cabin-packing-list/">What to bring to a rented
cabin</a>.</p>
<p><strong>7. Check for road construction</strong> . Before
leaving, check your local DOT website. But it's always hard to pinpoint
where the worst delays will be.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_caribou_highlands.jpg" alt="The pool at Lutsen's Caribou Highlands resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Mountains.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Many people rely on smartphone apps, which are handy. But I also bring a
DeLorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteer to help me plot a getaway if necessary.</p>
<p>The big red books, available at bookstores, outdoors stores and Targets,
show every little county road and make it easier to see the bigger
picture. The Wisconsin one was invaluable during the floods of June
2008, when I-94 was a parking lot — it helped me peel away and find an
alternative route on back roads.</p>
<p><strong>8. Use the telephone.</strong> Don't be afraid
to talk to a real person! Sure, there's a lot of good information on the
Internet, but you'll get the best and most up-to-date information about
a place from the people who live there.</p>
<p>Websites can be — and often are — outdated. Not only will you get
the latest information from a real person, you'll often get inside
information if you're willing to do a little friendly chatting.</p>
<p>That's what people at visitors bureaus are there for — to help you
out.</p>
<p>Using the phone is especially important when choosing a lake resort for
your family. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/choosing-lake-resort/">One in
1,000</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong>9. Check reviews on online forums</strong> . Yes,
citizen posts on review sites are notorious for their snarkiness and
unrealistic expectations. But if there are enough reviews of a place —
at least 10 — you'll get a pretty good idea of what they're like.</p>
<p>And use the forums at such sites as Tripadvisor, Yelp and Chowhound to
ask questions about the trip you're planning. Other users are amazingly
willing to help.</p>
<p><strong>10. Be a contrarian</strong> . Don't move with
the pack; go the opposite way. On holiday weekends, go south instead of
north and avoid mind-numbing return traffic that will wipe out memories
of whatever fun you had.</p>
<p>Holiday weekends also are a great time to visit big cities, because
conventions rarely come to town then and hotels rates are a third what
they are when there's a big convention or festival.</p>
<p>On Memorial Day weekend, I like to go to Chicago or head south along the
Mississippi River Valley toward northeast Iowa.</p>
<p>On the Fourth of July, I stay home — everyone can find a festival
close to home then.</p>
<p>My favorite time to travel is the last two weeks of August — the
weather is good, families are headed back to school, and already hotel
rates are lower. This is the best time to visit busy Door County.</p>
<p>The week before Labor Day is a great time to go to a lake resort; many
offer 10 days for the price of seven.</p>
<p>The first two weeks of September are the lull before the big fall-color
season and a good time to travel.</p>
<p>During fall-color season in Minnesota, go to lakes country in the center
of the state instead of the North Shore — the color is better, and
it's practically deserted.</p>
<p>Don't plan a last-minute trip to Minnesota during the school break in
October, because all the vacation areas book up. This is a good time for
Minnesotans to go to Wisconsin or the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.</p>
<p>My favorite time to hike on Minnesota's North Shore is the week after
the school break, when hotel rates go down, crowds are gone and the
trails have hardened.</p>
<p>I like to hike in November, too, but starting on the first Saturday in
November, I go to Wisconsin, where the deer firearms-hunting season
doesn't start until the third Saturday.</p>
<p>If you DO want to travel in peak season and catch the biggest festivals,
plan ahead.</p>
