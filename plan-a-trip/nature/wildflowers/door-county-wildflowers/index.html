<h2>On this Wisconsin peninsula, a vast array of wildflowers rewards those weary of winter.</h2>

Sanctuary.

<p>Goldthread and gaywings. Bogbean and trailing arbutus. In Wisconsin's
Door County, it's enough to make a naturalist hyperventilate.</p>
<p>Cherry blossoms and daffodils are the showiest spring flowers on this
tourist playground between Lake Michigan and Green Bay. But it's the
wildflowers, many of them rare, that provide the most joyous proof that
spring has arrived.</p>
<p>On sandy ridges, the first flower spotted often is the once-common
trailing arbutus, whose waxy white blossoms emerge in April.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the first big sign of spring, and when it's in full bloom, it
reminds me of Ivory dish soap,&quot; says naturalist Karen Newbern. &quot;I
usually find myself getting down on my knees and sticking my nose into
them.&quot;</p>
<p>Every type of wildflower flourishes on this narrow peninsula, from the
steep dolomite headlands along Green Bay to the bogs and beaches of Lake
Michigan. But one spot is such a luxuriant showplace it's practically
the Tiffany's of wildflowers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Along Baileys Harbor, 25 species of orchids grow amid 30 sand ridges,
pushed ashore in a ripple pattern over 1,200 years. Separated by wetland
strips called swales, they're home to species rare in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The threatened dwarf lake iris grows here by the thousands, along with
Arctic primrose, cancer root and ram's head lady's slipper. Cool lake
breezes give this patch of land the characteristics of boreal forest,
normally found much farther north.</p>
<p>&quot;It's also called taiga,&quot; Newbern says. &quot;We've had people from
Sweden here who recognized the plants, and naturalists from Russia —
their language was limited, but they could throw around the Latin names,
so we had a common language.&quot;</p>
<p>Habitat for more species of plants than any other place in the state, it
nearly became a trailer park in 1937. Local citizens protested, and the
original 40 acres became Ridges Sanctuary; since then, the preserve has
grown to more than 1,400 acres.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/door_county_ridges_boardwalk.jpg" alt="At Ridges Sanctuary, a visitor examines a bog flower." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's a magnet for nature lovers in May, when it holds its three-day
Festival of Nature, with naturalist-led field trips throughout the
northern half of the county.</p>
<h3>Looking for wildflowers</h3>
<p>When I was there one year, I started out at the Ridges, with a walk led
by Newbern and volunteer Cathie Mann.</p>
<p>From the visitors center, we walked down a boardwalk between two 1869
range lights that once allowed Lake Michigan sailors to get &quot;on range&quot;
by lining up their fixed white and red beacons.</p>
<p>On the marshy land below, we could see the tiny lake iris, with
yellow-and-white tongues amid purple petals. Today, they grow only in
Michigan and three counties of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>&quot;Because they like the shoreline, they've really suffered from
development,&quot; Newbern said.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Across from the lower range light, at the edge of the beach, we found a
cluster of wildflowers that included arctic primrose, Indian paintbrush,
bastard toadflax and starry Solomon's plume. They were all on the
petite side.</p>
<p>&quot;If you ate nothing but sand, you'd be skinny, too,&quot; Mann said.</p>
<p>Life isn't easy for the plant life. On the beach, Newbern pointed out
phragmites, a fast-spreading reed that chokes every native plant in its
path.</p>
<p>&quot;Picture crabgrass on steroids,&quot; she said. &quot;That's what this stuff
is; I kid you not.&quot;</p>
<p>From the beach, we walked along Sandy Trail lined with gaywings, whose
bright-magenta sepals turn out like the wings of an airplane.</p>
<p>On Sandy Swale, Newbern pointed out bog rosemary and the red-veined
leaves of a pitcher plant, which digests insects that crawl into its
pitcher-shaped leaves and drown in the water that collects there.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/i/ridges_gaywings.jpg" alt="Ridges Sanctuary gaywings." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In late spring, gaywings bloom along the trails of Ridges Sanctuary.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the Wintergreen Trail, we found a tiny goldthread and the leaves of
the ram's head lady's slipper, the sanctuary's rarest and most
elusive flower. It blooms in early June with the more-abundant pink
moccasin and yellow lady's slippers.</p>
<p>Beside a boardwalk over Cowslip Swale, we saw a stand of bogbean, also
called buckbean, whose star-shaped flowers were filled with crinkly,
glowing white hairs.</p>
<p>We were nearly back to the visitors center when Newbern stooped to point
out the asparagus-like stem of the striped coralroot, a cold-loving
pinkish orchid that contains no chlorophyll or green leaves.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why I like going with these naturalists; otherwise, I'd walk
right by,&quot; said Teri Rycyzyn of Tinley Park, Ill. &quot;It's wonderful,
all these people willing to share what they know.&quot;</p>

<h3>A walk through the trees</h3>
<p>In the afternoon, I joined Mike Schneider's trees and shrubs walk on
the other side of the peninsula, on the exposed western edge of the
Niagara Escarpment.</p>
<p>Door Bluff Headlands Park, Schneider said, owes its untouched state to
Jens Jensen, the landscape architect who, in 1935, founded the Clearing,
the folk school Schneider now directs.</p>
<p>&quot;Jens was on the five-man advisory board that had to decide what to do
with it, and he said, 'Do nothing — keep it, and some day people will
appreciate having it,'&quot; Schneider said.</p>
<p>Clinging to dolomite cliffs high above Green Bay, gnarled white cedars
were hundreds of years old but still no bigger than a bodybuilder's
bicep. Schneider calls them &quot;amazing survivors.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/door_county_two_dwarf_iris.jpg" alt="Dwarf lake iris grow in Door County" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The dwarf lake iris is endangered, but it grows by the hundreds in Door
County's Ridges Sanctuary.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;This has to be one of the most difficult environments in North
America,&quot; he said. &quot;There's hardly any soil, hardly any nutrients,
and it's prone to deep freezes and drying winter winds.&quot;</p>
<p>Early French explorers called the trees arbor vitae, he said, because
there's enough vitamin C in their leaves to cure scurvy.</p>
<p>We passed a wild black cherry, known as the potato-chip tree for its
flaky bark; a white ash, used for baseball bats; and basswood, favored
by decoy carvers. Schneider knew them all.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a tree fanatic,&quot; he said.</p>
<h3>Cruise to <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/rock-island-state-park-wisconsin/">Rock Island</a></h3>
<p>Spring arrives first on the Green Bay side of Door County, surrounded by
shallower waters that warm up faster. On the cooler Lake Michigan side,
trees leaf out and wildflowers bloom one week or even two weeks later.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/rock_island_boathouse.jpg" alt="Boathouse on Rock Island State Park" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A 1927 stone boathouse greets visitors to Rock Island.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;It's great,&quot; says Paul Regnier, former Ridges Sanctuary director.
&quot;If you're on the bay side, you can say, 'OK, these are gone, let's
go to the lake side and see them there.' &quot;</p>
<p>At Rock Island State Park, completely surrounded by water at the far tip
of the peninsula, spring comes later still. Regnier led a Festival of
Nature field trip to the island.</p>
<p>As we walked through maple-beech forest to the 1858 Pottawatomie Light,
he told us why its uncluttered floor made it easy for him to spot wild
leeks and the odd spring ephemeral.</p>
<p>&quot;Alien worms brought in by the fishing industry are eating all the leaf
matter,&quot; Regnier said. &quot;They advance right through and eat things up.
You take that away, and the whole forest changes.&quot;</p>
<p>On the sunnier parts of the island, however, Indian paintbrush
flourished, carpeting the sandy paths leading to the beach.</p>
<p>The biggest splashes appear in May: scarlet paintbrush, bright white
trillium and the shiny yellow lady's slipper, official wildflower of
Door County.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baileys_harbor_range_lights2.jpg" alt="Baileys Harbor range lights." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Boat captains used these range lights to help them enter Baileys Harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;After living in this gray-green landscape, to get these bright colors,
it's good for the soul,&quot; Regnier says.</p>
<p>All flowers are welcome in spring. But if you go to Door County in late
May or June, try to find the little ones you may not see anywhere else.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to make that annual pilgrimage down to your knees,&quot; Cathie
Mann says.</p>
<p>Anyone can spot a daffodil. In Door County, you can spot just about
anything.</p>

<p>Near Ridges Sanctuary off Ridges Road, across from the house with fire
number 1981, a short drive leads to the trails of <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=57">Toft Point Natural
Area</a>,
where the family of environmentalist Emma Toft once ran a fishing camp.</p>
<p>There's canoeing and kayaking on the <a href="http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/wisconsin/placesweprotect/mink-river-estuary.xml">Mink River
Estuary</a>, and Nature Conservancy trails lead into the estuary from each side.</p>
<p>From County Road P/Mink River Road, watch for a green-and-yellow sign
marking a small parking lot. From there, it's a beautiful hourlong walk
through a corridor of cedars and maples.</p>
<p>The Northern Door, including Washington Island and Rock Island, has two
