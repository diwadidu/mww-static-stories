<h2>In 12 tried-and-true spots, you'll find a profusion of blooms.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/nerstrand_rue_anemone.jpg" alt="Rue anemone in Nerstrand Big Woods." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Rue anemone carpets the forest floor at Nerstrand Big Woods.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When delicate spring wildflowers appear, it means winter finally is
over.</p>
<p>No wonder we love them so much. But they're ephemeral — here today,
gone tomorrow.</p>
<p>So if you want a good dose of them, head for a place where you know
they'll be.</p>
<p>One well-known hot spot is Nerstrand Big Woods State Park in southern
Minnesota. The first time I went, I saw trout lilies, spring beauties,
violets, hepatica, bloodroot and rue anemone before I was even out of
the picnic area.</p>
<p>They're not uncommon, but they won't grow just anywhere. They like
Nerstrand because its maple-basswood forest, Minnesota's largest
remnant of what early settlers called the Big Woods, give them a good
habitat.</p>
<p>One of its flowers, the dwarf trout lily, is especially persnickety.
This endangered plant, which barely reproduces, is found only in three
counties in Minnesota.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At Nerstrand, the frail little flower grows, perversely, right at the
end of the boardwalk on the well-trod path to Hidden Falls. That's where
we saw eight of them, next to a clump of cut-leafed toothwort.</p>
<p>For displays of flashier flowers, Nerstrand is the emporium of state
parks. In many spots, clouds of false rue anemone had given the forest
floor a carpet of white.</p>
<p>Brassy marsh marigolds popped out of the muck along a stream, and the
pale-yellow petals of large-flowered bellwort swung in the breeze, like
the fronds of a hula skirt.</p>
<p>Tiny as they are, these blooms fuel the imagination. When my son was
young, he called Dutchman's breeches &quot;shark's teeth,&quot; which is exactly
what they look like. He called early meadow rue &quot;French bedrooms,&quot;
because they look like the fat tassels that hang from a canopy bed.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/nerstrand_spring_beauty.jpg" alt="Spring beauty in Nerstrand Big Woods." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Spring beauty is one of the first ephemerals to emerge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>To me, the bloom of the wild ginger, demurely tucked under fan-shaped
leaves, looked like an escapee from &quot;Little Shop of Horrors,&quot; with
three tentacles unfurling from a fuchsia-rimmed cup.</p>
<p>And the common trout lily, growing here and there throughout the park,
seemed to have moods. On some, all six white petals were flung up, as if
clapping hands; on others, just one or two were up, as if scratching an
ear; and on others, the petals hung dejectedly.</p>
<p>Amazing qualities have been ascribed to these flowers. Indian women are
said to have used trillium as a love potion, dropping it into the food
of a coveted man.</p>
<p>Europeans considered lousewort a virtuous flower, and thought that
serpents caught in a bed of it would lash themselves to death. Many
plants were used for medicinal purposes, and some still are.</p>
<p>But most people like wildflowers because they're pretty.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We got tips on dwarf trout lilies and Jack-in-the-pulpit from Sandra and
Gary Holmberg, who had been camping in the park, hoping to catch waves
of migrating warblers.</p>
<p>&quot;We're birders, but when there are so many wildflowers, you can't help
but get interested in them,&quot; Sandra Holmberg said. &quot;And at least
wildflowers are lower to the ground, so you don't need to be looking up.
You don't do things like break your leg, which I did in this park last
year.&quot;</p>
<p>After the early-spring ephemerals disappear, other flowers take their
place.</p>
<p>Wild blue phlox, swamp buttercup, Jack-in-the-pulpit and yellow violet
are part of the second wave, soon joined by May apple, trillium, wild
geranium, columbine, Solomon's seal and lady's slipper.</p>
<p>It's not hard to find spring wildflowers; look in any park, wildlife
refuge or nature preserve.</p>

Yellow beadlily blooms along the Cascade River on Minnesota's North
Shore.

<p>It's not so much <em>where</em> you look as <em>when</em> you look — the first half
of May for the first wave and the second half for the second wave.</p>
<p>Here are my favorite wildflower hot spots.</p>

<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/nerstrand_big_woods/index.html">Nerstrand-Big Woods State
Park</a>
near Northfield.</strong>  At the park office, pick up a wildflower checklist
and look through the photos in its loose-leaf wildflower  guide.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/whitewater/index.html">Whitewater State
Park</a> near
St. Charles.</strong>  This park has nearly every bloom and naturalists to help
identify them. Its annual wildflower walks are very popular, so reserve
a place early.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/carley/index.html">Carley State
Park</a> near
Plainview.</strong> Near Whitewater, this small park has masses of false rue
anemone and Virginia bluebells and holds a Bluebell Festival on the
second Saturday of May.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/gardens__bird_sanctuaries/eloise_butler_wildflower_garden_and_bird_sanctuary/">Eloise Butler Wildflower
Garden</a>
in Minneapolis.</strong>  In Wirth Park, off Interstate 394 at Theodore Wirth
Parkway and Glenwood Avenue, it's thick with blooms in spring, and
naturalists leads regular walks.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/wildflowers-spring-north-shore/">Minnesota's North Shore</a>.</strong>
This stretch of Lake Superior has so many wildflowers because it has so
many habitats — boreal forest, bluff tops, bogs and rocky
outcroppings, such as Artists' Point in Grand Marais. Typically, the
peak is late May to early June.</p>
<h3>Minnesota-Wisconsin</h3>
<p>From Lake Pepin to the Iowa border, parks and preserves in the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/chasing-wildflowers/">Mississippi River Valley</a> have a big variety
of woodland wildflowers as well as prairie flowers that bloom on
sun-drenched hillside goat prairies.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/i/ridges_iris.jpg" alt="Ridges Sanctuary dwarf lake iris." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The endangered dwarf lake iris grows in a few spots on Lake Michigan,
especially at Ridges Sanctuary.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.ridgessanctuary.org/">Ridges Sanctuary</a> in Baileys
Harbor.</strong>  This magic place on Lake Michigan in Door County is the home
of many rare orchids and bog plants, such as gaywings, goldthread and
buckbean. Go during Festival of Nature on Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/perrot/">Perrot State Park</a> in
Trempealeau.</strong>  On the climb to  Brady's Bluff, you'll see the gamut
of shade-loving ephemerals and then the region's best display of
jeweled shooting stars.</p>
<h3>Iowa</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/iowa-state-park-cabins/">Backbone State
Park</a> near
Strawberry Point.</strong>  Walk around the lake in this lovely park and
you'll find masses of flowers tucked into rocky nooks and on wooded
glades.</p>
<h3>Illinois</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/starved-rock-park-illinois/">Starved Rock State
Park</a>
near Utica.</strong>  The moist canyon floors of this Illinois River park are
filled with bluebells and a sampling of other spring flowers, such as
prairie trillium and Jack in the pulpit. On blufftop trails, you'll
find ephemerals and clumps of jeweled shooting stars.</p>
<h3>Michigan</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/best-sights-mackinac-island/">Mackinac
Island</a>.</strong>
This wooded island in the straits between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron
is famous for lilacs, but earlier in the season it also has nice
displays of Dutchman's breeches, Canadian anemone, dwarf lake iris,
trillium and, in the first half of June, yellow lady's slippers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.garfield-twp.com/gtcommons.asp">Grand Traverse Commons</a>
Natural Area, <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Traverse
City</a>.</strong> The woods of northern Michigan are THE place to go if you want to see
thousands of large-leafed trilliums.</p>
<p>But you also can see hillsides covered with them right in Traverse City,
in the park behind the Village at Grand Traverse Commons retail
development. A bit earlier in the season, you can see many yellow trout
lilies.</p>
