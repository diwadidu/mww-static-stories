<h2>On the shores of Lake Superior, delicate blooms mark the return of warmth.</h2>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In spring, not that many people go to the North Shore to see the
flowers.</p>
<p>They're small, and the rest of the scenery is big and distracting —
roaring waterfalls, jagged cliffs and that mesmerizing inland sea that
fills the horizon.</p>
<p>If you do look down, you'll find them huddled in cracks on lava flows,
tucked along hiking trails and in boggy patches along streams. They're
dainty, but many are fairly unusual — butterwort as well as bluebells,
rock clematis along with columbine.</p>
<p>They stick around for a while, too, because the air from Lake Superior
keeps them as cool as a florist's case.</p>
<p>Often, they don't appear until nearly June. But one year when I went up
the third weekend of May, they were blooming everywhere.</p>
<p>The North Shore still was 30 degrees cooler than the Twin Cities but
warm for the shores of Lake Superior at 55 degrees. And conditions were
sunny and dry, so they'd arrived early.</p>
<p>I was walking around the rocky breakwall in Grand Marais when I ran into
Glen and Donna Hambleton, who looked as if they'd just seen a much-loved
friend.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They'd come to visit their favorite patch of butterwort, a tiny purple
flower that looks like a shorter but more elegant harebell, the most
common flower found on Lake Superior's volcanic outcroppings.</p>
<p>&quot;We come to see them every year,&quot; Donna said. &quot;They're an arctic plant
and very rare.&quot;</p>
<p>They said they also make regular visits to see the spring flowers on the
Superior Hiking Trail spur to White Sky Rock, east of Lutsen Mountain,
and at Sugarloaf Cove nature preserve near Schroeder, where they
volunteer.</p>
<p>Climbing around on the breakwall rock, I found the butterwort in a
protected nook, waving in the breeze near purple-veined white violets.
Nearby, I spotted a few frail Arctic primroses.</p>
<p>In every season, this finger of rock on the harbor is full of the random
beauty of nature. Bright-orange lichen grew in splats of white lichen,
like a sunny-side up egg. At the tips of a squat spruce tree, buds as
round and bright-red as strawberries sprouted.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/b/oberg_bluebells.jpg" alt="Bluebells at Oberg Mountain." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

spots as the mouth of the Cascade River.

<p>There are whole masses of butterwort — like a pitcher plant, it's
carnivorous, catching insects on its sticky leaves — along the shore
in Cascade River State Park at <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/sna01045/index.html">Butterwort Cliffs Scientific and Natural
Area</a>.
Unfortunately, it's closed from May 1 through Aug. 15 to protect a
herring gull nesting colony.</p>
<p>But inland, around the mouth of the Cascade River, I found all kinds of
spring wildflowers. There were fiddlehead ferns, some stretched up and
some with their heads still tightly coiled like a shepherd's crook.</p>
<p>Big patches of northern bluebells grew in sunnier spots, in pastel
shades of pink and blue — they become blue as they mature. These also
are known as lungwort and are cousins of Virginia bluebells, the larger
and more bell-shaped flowers found along streams farther south.</p>
<p>On the trail that climbs the river gorge, I found a goldthread, a plant
named not for its sparkly, sequin-like stamens but for its long golden
root.</p>
<p>There was a bluebead lily, whose flung-out petals are pale yellow; its
name comes from the bright-blue berry it produces in late summer.</p>
<p>And there were the white, bottle-brush flowers of the Canada mayflower,
also called false lily of the valley, and lots of bunchberry. This low
plant is seen all around Lake Superior.</p>
<p>It produces four fat white sepals in spring and red berries in late
summer, which look spectacular if a plant is growing next to the
bluebead lily.</p>
<p>Down the shore, I stopped by Lutsen Lodge and chatted with activities
staffer Melissa Carlson, who said she often leads wildflower hikes to
Oberg Mountain.</p>
<p>Most people think of hiking the two-mile Oberg trail in fall, when its
many overlooks provide views of the mountain's inland maple forest.</p>
<p>So I went there. Sure enough, it was more than worthy of a spring hike,
with all of the spring ephemerals that came and went so fast farther
south.</p>
<p>The first thing I saw as I climbed up the trail was a large pink flower
hanging off the side of a rock outcropping. It was floppier than the
familiar garden clematis but obviously a relative; checking my
wildflower book, I saw it was a rock clematis.</p>
<p>Along the hillside trail, I found spring beauty and yellow violets and
more bluebells. And there were nodding trillium, daintier and much more
shy than the large-leafed trillium, which spread their giant white
petals to the sun.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/b/oberg_columbine.jpg" alt="Columbine on Oberg Mountain." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I saw a pointy white starflower, longleafed bluet and, near one of the
many overlooks, a gracefully arched red-and-yellow columbine that framed
itself beautifully against the Lake Superior horizon.</p>
<p>Farther down the shoreline near Schroeder, I stopped at Sugarloaf Cove
to walk the one-mile nature trail.</p>
<p>It was as delightful as always, but the most interesting flowers were
right along the parking lot and near the nature center — strawberry,
with its distinctive notched leaves; pussytoes; and pink tenpoint phlox.</p>
<p>Like so much on the North Shore, this phlox is smaller and crouches
lower than the ubiquitous wild blue phlox, and its five notched petals
give it its name.</p>
<p>In the nature center, a chalkboard phrenology listed the other flowers
seen, including sarsaparilla, juneberry and nodding trillium.</p>
<p>My last stop was Split Rock State Park, where I didn't see much except
for marsh marigolds growing along a shaded stream. But they were one of
the most perfect clumps I'd seen, pert and intensely yellow, reflecting
the sun.</p>
<p>That spring was unusual in that the early warmth telescoped the
progression of spring wildflowers; in most places, spring beauty and
marsh marigolds are part of the first wave, and columbine and trillium
part of the second.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/u/sugarloaf_tenpoint_phlox.jpg" alt="Spring phlox at Sugarloaf." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>On the North Shore, the rocky nooks, shaded lowlands and moist gorge
walls create growing conditions that don't follow the rules. For
wildflower stalkers, that means that every visit includes surprises.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Wildflowers of the North Shore</h3>
<p><em>When to go</em> : Usually, spring wildflowers peak in early June. However,
some  will pop up earlier in spots that are warm and sunny.</p>
<p><em>How to identify them</em> : Treat yourself to a copy of the excellent
&quot;Wildflowers of the Boundary Waters&quot; by Betty Vos Hemstad ($22.95,
Minnesota Historical Society Press).</p>
<p>It includes gorgeous, full-color photographs that show the plant
close-up, as you'll see it on the ground and in various stages of
development. The text is engaging, too.</p>
<p><em>Where to look</em> : Any of your favorite hikes will have some. For the
most popular, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">Hiking the North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Grand
Marais</a>
: The breakwall harbors arctic-alpine plants. And it's always fun to
walk around Artists' Point.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/cascade_river/index.html">Cascade River State
Park</a> :
This park between Grand Marais and Lutsen has many flowers in the
low-lying ground around its mouth and along the trail that rises with
the river gorge.</p>
<p><em>White Sky Rock</em> : A short spur leads there from Lake Agnes on the
popular <a href="https://superiorhiking.org/trail-section/lutsen-to-grand-marais/">6.4-mile stretch of the Superior Hiking
Trail</a>
between Lutsen Mountain and the Caribou Trail (County Road 4).</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/b/oberg_nodding_trillium.jpg" alt="Nodding trillium at Oberg Mountain." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The nodding trillium is less bold than its larger cousin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Oberg Mountain</em> : This two-mile hike just south of Lutsen probably is
the most popular on the shore. Take Forest Road 336, or Onion River
Road, two miles to a parking area.</p>
<p>Cross the road to the trail; after a short distance, turn onto the
1.8-mile Oberg loop, which winds around the summit.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sugarloafnorthshore.org/">Sugarloaf Cove</a> : This spot, once
used by a logging company to assemble log rafts, has gone back to nature
and now is one of the loveliest spots on the North Shore. It's six
miles west (south) of Schroeder, at Mile Marker 73.</p>
<p>A one-mile interpretive trail winds through a red-pine plantation and
alder thicket to a U-shaped cobblestone cove that faces nor'easters
head-on and is a good place to watch waves.</p>
<p>In the log nature center, interpretive staff give Saturday programs and
also coax the plunder away from light-fingered visitors, so other people
can see it, too.</p>
