<p>In May, the woods are full of people on the hunt.</p>
<p>Some are stalking morel mushrooms. Others are trying to bag a turkey or
spot a rare warbler.</p>
<p>The rest of us are content to chase wildflowers. For one thing, we're
guaranteed success.</p>
<p>&quot;We usually look for wildflowers, because there are lots of them around,
and unlike wildlife, they don't run away,&quot; said Dave Hanke of Shakopee,
Minn., who was photographing in Whitewater State Park one May. &quot;And if
one thing isn't blooming, something else is.&quot;</p>
<p>Finding a certain wildflower can take a little effort. But your chances
are especially good in the southeast corner of Minnesota and along the
Mississippi River in southwest Wisconsin.</p>

<h3>Zumbro Falls SNA</h3>
<p>Canoeing down the Zumbro River in southeast Minnesota one May with my
husband, I pulled in at the Zumbro Falls Woods state natural area on the
west bank to look at the Virginia bluebells, which lined the banks in
bright-blue clusters.</p>
<p>Under the basswood canopy, there was a carpet of false rue anemone,
spring beauty and lacy beds of Dutchman's breeches.</p>
<p>My quarry, however, was on the opposite bank, where the jeweled shooting
star supposedly blooms on dry limestone cliffs.</p>
<p>Scrabbling along the rock, barely keeping my footing — and completely
forgetting about the rattlesnakes that frequent warm rock in spring —
I did see a stunning clump of woollypod milk-vetch, with 10 deep-purple
tubular petals on each stem, and an orange-gold clump of hoary puccoon.</p>
<p>Farther up, I found a violet wood sorrel and delicate columbines
shooting up from rock crevices.</p>
<p>The shooting stars, though, were nowhere to be seen.</p>

<h3>Whitewater State Park</h3>
<p>The next day, we went to Whitewater State Park, where Judy Shepard was leading a wildflower walk.</p>
<p>Along the trail that leads to the cart-in camping sites, she pointed out
a full palette of spring ephemerals — wild ginger, toothwort,
bird-foot violet, bloodroot, buttercup, Jack-in-the-pulpit and false rue
anemone, which had turned the forest floor white.</p>
<p>Marsh marigolds were blossoming in the muck around a creek, and that's
where we found Dave and Terri Hanke. Earlier, they'd caught the peak of
the pasque flower display at <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/detail.html?id=sna01066"><strong>River Terrace Prairie state natural
area</strong></a> just
to the north, near Cannon Falls, by checking on the first two weekends
in April, long before their normal peak.</p>
<p>&quot;Timing is so important for these spring flowers,&quot; Terri Hanke said.
&quot;Their life span is so short.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Meanwhile, Judy Shepard had some tips for me: nearby <em>Carley State Park</em>
for bluebells, <em>Beaver Creek Valley State Park</em> for an unusually good
display of large-leafed trout lilies — and the Brady's Bluff Trail in
<em>Perrot State Park</em> for the jeweled shooting star, which she'd seen only
the day before.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just carpeted,&quot; she said. &quot;It's really gorgeous.&quot;</p>
<p>We headed for Trempealeau, on the Wisconsin side of the Mississippi
between La Crosse and Winona.</p>
<h3>Mound Prairie SNA</h3>
<p>But on the way, we stopped at <em>Mound Prairie state natural area</em> between
Houston and Hokah, where the jeweled shooting star is supposed to grow
on the steep goat prairies.</p>
<p>Standing on the shoulder of Minnesota 16, also Historic Bluff Country
Scenic Byway, we looked up at the first bald, lumpy mound and saw
nothing but parched grass.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/v/i/violets.jpg" alt="Wood sorrel in spring." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In May, wood sorrel grows in Minnesota bluff country.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Climbing, we started to see pussytoes at our feet, then hoary puccoon
and Indian paintbrush. The seed heads of prairie smoke waved in the
breeze, near the star-shaped petals of blue-eyed grass.</p>
<p>And blooming everywhere was an odd, pale-yellow flower that, from above,
looked just like a pinwheel.</p>
<p>It turned out to be wood betony, or lousewort, named because farmers
once thought cattle became infested with lice when grazing on them.</p>
<p>It was an amazing display of spring prairie flowers — but no shooting
stars.</p>
<h3>Perrot State Park</h3>
<p>It was already 6:30 p.m. when we arrived in Trempealeau and bought a
one-hour pass at Perrot State Park.</p>
<p>Following the trail up the western flank of Brady's Bluff, we passed
through Fern Gully, a cool nook where Dutchman's breeches and ferns
clung to the side of a rock face. Around the corner, trillium and
bellwort grew on a shady hillside.</p>
<p>And then we saw them — fragrant jeweled shooting stars as far as the
eye could see, up and down a hillside, more copious than dandelions and
much lovelier.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_jacobs_ladder.jpg" alt="Jacob's ladder at Whitewater." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The view was incredible too. We were exactly opposite the hill French
explorers called La Montagne Qui Trempe a l'eau, the mountain that
soaks in the water, and through a curtain of trees, we could see it as
well as the surrounding river and sloughs.</p>
<p>We saw more shooting stars while continuing on the CCC-built trail, as
well as rock cress, columbine and starry Solomon's plume.</p>
<p>At the top of the 520-foot bluff, we took in the magnificent view and
learned that this magic place would have been part of Minnesota, had
glacial debris not forced the Mississippi to cut a new channel around La
Montagne and the park, placing them at the edge of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>By the time we headed home along Lake Pepin, we felt we'd done pretty
well, wildflower-wise. Still, we had one more stop.</p>
<h3>Rustic Road 51</h3>
<p>Just south of Maiden Rock, Wis., we turned onto County Road AA, from
which Rustic Road 51 follows Pine Creek.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/maiden_rock_spring_drive.jpg" alt="Rustic Road 51 in spring." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Spring ephemerals line Rustic Road 51, near Maiden Rock on Lake Pepin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>One of more than 100 stretches of country road that preserve remnants of
old Wisconsin (see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/rustic-roads/">Wisconsin's Rustic
Roads</a> ), the packed-dirt
road was covered by a canopy of budding trees and lined with false rue
anemone and spring beauty.</p>
<p>We crawled along in the car for a while, but then we had to get out and
walk.</p>
<p>All the spring ephemerals were there, plus fiddlehead ferns and
watercress in the stream and horsetail rushes covering the hillside. We
saw hundreds of bellwort and beds of Dutchman's breeches and their
cousin, white squirrel corn.</p>
<p>Only a mile farther, the floral display jumped ahead a week, with glossy
green hillsides dotted with large-flowered trillium, blue wood phlox and
spiderwort.</p>
<p>Strolling on the road, I spotted purple ground ivy, tiny yellow winter
cress, early meadow rue and even a few yellow fawn lilies, with
peach-veined backs.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>For variety and nonstop coverage, it beat even Nerstand-Big Woods State
Park in Minnesota, long the standard for spring wildflowers.</p>
<p>Spring wildflowers in deciduous forests usually peak in mid-May, and
then they'll be replaced by May apple, trillium, wild geranium,
columbine and Solomon's seal.</p>
<p>In June, orchid-lovers will start to haunt prairies, bogs and ditches in
search for as many of Minnesota's 42 species as they can find, including
the state flower, the showy lady's slipper.</p>
<p>The next big display comes in late summer, when blazing star, aster,
goldenrod and purple coneflower bloom, as well as tick-trefoil, wild
indigo, leadplant and dozens of members of the daisy family.</p>
<p>So if you miss one show, you can always catch the next.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Wildflowers in the Mississippi River Valley</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/trempealeau_flower_hillside.jpg" alt="Wildflowers in Trempealeau." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In May, jeweled shooting stars cover the side of Brady's Bluff near
Trempealeau.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>When to go:</em>  The first two weeks of May usually are peak for spring
ephemerals, and the second wave of spring wildflowers follows during the
the last two weeks of May and first week of June.</p>
<p><em>Where to go:</em>  Here's a great driving loop to take from the Twin
Cities, heading southeast through Minnesota bluff country and returning
along the Mississippi River.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/nerstrand_big_woods/index.html">Nerstrand-Big Woods State
Park</a>:</strong> This park near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/"><strong>Northfield</strong></a>
is famous for its large variety of spring ephemerals, which thrive under
the hardwood forest canopy. The park office has a loose-leaf binder of
pictures that help you identify types.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/detail.html?id=sna01099">Zumbro Falls
Woods</a>:</strong> This
scientific and natural area can be reached from the Zumbro River or, on
the western side, by a parking lot at the end of Township Road 7, off
U.S. 63 south of <em>Zumbro Falls</em> .</p>
<p>The clifftops on the eastern side of the river can be reached by taking
the first right off Minnesota 60 east of Zumbro Falls.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/whitewater/index.html">Whitewater State
Park</a>:</strong>
This picturesque bluff-country park just north of <em>St. Charles</em> holds
one of Minnesota's best variety of spring ephemerals; one of the best
places to see them is on the path to the walk-in campsites.</p>
<p>In May, it's also a hot spot for fly fishing and morel-mushroom
hunting. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/whitewater-state-park-minnesota/">Minnesota's spring
mecca</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/carley/index.html">Carley State
Park</a>:</strong> This
little park, where white pines line a sunken bowl in the middle of
farmland, is 12 miles northwest of Whitewater.</p>
<p>Thousands of bluebells and clouds of false rue anemone cover an oxbow in
the North Branch of the Whitewater River.</p>
<p>Along with the nearby town of Plainview, it celebrates <a href="https://www.plainvieweda.org/community-celebrations/">Bluebell
Festival</a> in early
May.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/detail.html?id=sna01059">Mound Prairie SNA</a>:</strong> This scientific and natural area includes three goat prairies on each
side of Minnesota 16, <em>between Houston and Hokah</em> , and contains many
rare wildflowers in early and late summer as well as superb views of the
surrounding countryside. Watch out for rattlesnakes.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/perrot/index.html">Perrot State
Park</a>:</strong> Reached
from the western edge of
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Trempealeau</a>,</strong>
Wis., this park is a jewel, and not just for its shooting stars. It's
surrounded by wildlife refuges and canoeing trails, and the Great River
State Trail goes through its northern edge.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/tours/rustic-road-51-199098">Rustic Road
51</a>:</strong> It's
a four-mile stretch off County Road AA, just south of <em>Maiden Rock</em> on
the Wisconsin side of <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/driving-lake-pepin/"><strong>Lake
Pepin</strong></a>.</p>
<p>If possible, walk it. The Legion park along the road also is a nice
place for a picnic.</p>
