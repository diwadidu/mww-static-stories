<h2>It's coming, in all its glory. Here's what to watch for and where to go.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/durand_morel.jpg" alt="Morel mushrooms near Durand." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>When the snow is gone, the fun begins.</p>
<p>Most of us would be happy to see something, anything, that's green. But
there's no reason to wait for that before going outdoors.</p>
<p>Early spring is the best time to hunt for agates on Great Lakes beaches,
where winter storms have tossed up a new batch of rocks. If you wait
until July, when most tourists arrive, they'll be picked over.</p>
<p>Waterfalls soon will be roaring in north-woods forests, and there's no
tree canopy to obscure the views. It's also easiest to spot bald eagles
in their nests.</p>
<p>Pasqueflowers pop up on sunny hillsides in April, even before trees
bud.</p>
<p>Then May arrives, and nature really lets loose. Morel mushrooms pop up
under dead leaves. Warblers migrate north. Spring ephemerals carpet
forest floors.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Now is the time to sign up for bird-festival field trips and popular
state-park wildflower and morel programs.</p>
<p>Morel hunters should scout for likely spots now, before the ticks come
out.</p>
<p>Here's where to find the best of spring, and when to look.</p>
<h3>Agates</h3>
<p>Lake Superior agates, the Minnesota state gemstone, can be found
throughout eastern Minnesota. They're easiest to find in gravel pits
and near road construction, but it's more fun to hunt for them on
pretty <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-north-shore/">North Shore beaches</a>.</p>
<p>Sunny days are best, either early in the day or late in the afternoon,
when rays are slanting across the rocks. But drizzly days can be good,
too, because a film of water makes agates glisten, so they're easier to
spot.</p>
<p>&quot;The Rock Picker's Guide to Lake Superior's North Shore,&quot; available in
local gift shops, is very handy. It says one of the best spots to look
is the mouth of the Beaver River, just east of Beaver Bay.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/finding-agates/">How to find an agate</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/g/agates.jpg" alt="Lake Superior agates." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Chris Polydoroff</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Lake Superior agates are easiest to find in spring.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/">Waterfalls</a></h3>
<p>April and May are when you'll see a waterfall at its most ferocious,
when rivers are swollen by snow melt. By the time most people are hiking
through the forest, in late summer and fall, waterfalls often are
shriveled to trickles.</p>
<p>Hop from one roaring waterfall to the next on Minnesota's North Shore</p>
<ul>
<li>from Gooseberry to the Baptism in Tettegouche State Park to the
Cascade and Brule. Just short of the Canadian border, High Falls on the
Pigeon River is the Niagara of Minnesota; you'll likely get misted.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/waterfalls-north-shore-minnesota/">Waterfalls of the North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>In northwest Wisconsin, Big Manitou Falls in Pattison State Park is the
highest falls at 165 feet, and the fourth-highest east of the Rockies;
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/wisconsin-waterfalls/">Waterfalls of northern
Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<p>Near the Twin Cities, Willow Falls in Wisconsin's <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/willowriver/">Willow River State
Park</a> is always
spectacular.</p>
<p>Wear shoes that are good for muddy trails. And while you're walking
through the forest, watch out for <em>shed antlers</em> along deer trails or
where deer have bedded down or browsed in undergrowth, where antlers can
become tangled.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/nerstrand_family.jpg" alt="A family hiking at Nerstrand Big Woods." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In southern Minnesota, Nerstrand Big Woods State Park is one of the best
places to find spring ephemerals.

<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/">Wildflowers</a></h3>
<p>For photos of the wildflowers you'll be looking for, see our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=115097&amp;id=104777055128">album of
spring
wildflowers</a>.</p>
<p>If weather is warm, spring ephemerals bloom in late April. The first big
display comes from pasqueflowers, a large member of the buttercup family
that has a thick, hairy stem and comes in shades of pink and lavender.</p>
<p>One of the best places to see them is on <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/sna01066/index.html">River Terrace
Prairie</a>, a
scientic and natural area along the Cannon River, on Minnesota 19 east
of Cannon Falls. In mid-April, if it's been warm, you'll see thousands
of them blooming on a west-facing gravel ridge.</p>
<p>These SNAs - scientific and natural areas in Minnesota, state natural
areas in Wisconsin — are run by the state parks but have no amenities.
Many have rare wildflowers; for more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/spring-hikes/">Spring in full
glory</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In Minneapolis, spring ephemerals start blooming in <a href="https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/gardens__bird_sanctuaries/eloise_butler_wildflower_garden_and_bird_sanctuary/">Eloise Butler
Wildflower
Garden</a>
by late April if weather is warm, and naturalists lead guided walks.</p>
<p>Jeweled shooting stars are one of the most elegant wildflowers, and
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/perrot/">Perrot State Park</a> in
Trempealeau, Wis., has a stunning display of them in mid-May. In
northern Illinois, <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/starved-rock-park-illinois/">Starved Rock State
Park</a>
also has quite a few but is best known for its vast quantities of
bluebells.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/chasing-wildflowers/">Chasing wildflowers</a>.</p>
<p>The earliest ephemerals found in hardwood forests are trout lilies,
spring beauties, hepatica, bloodroot, false rue anemone, bellwort,
Dutchman's breeches, toothwort, marsh marigolds, wild ginger and
Virginia bluebells.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/nerstrand_big_woods/index.html">Nerstrand-Big Woods State
Park</a>
in southeast Minnesota is best-known for them.</p>
<p>You'll see completely different plants on the goat prairies of
southeast Minnesota, along the sandy Wisconsin River and in state parks
with prairie.</p>
<p>Good parks to look include Wisconsin's <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/nelsondewey/">Nelson
Dewey</a> and Minnesota's
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/great_river_bluffs/index.html">Great River
Bluffs</a>
along the Mississippi and <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/blue_mounds/index.html">Blue
Mounds</a>
and <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/buffalo_river/index.html">Buffalo
River</a>
in western Minnesota.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/u/hudson_willow_falls.jpg" alt="Willow Falls near Hudson." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near the town of Hudson on the St. Croix River, Willow Falls is the big
draw of Willow River State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In mid-May, look for pussytoes, hoary puccoon, Indian paintbrush,
prairie smoke, blue-eyed grass, wood betony and jeweled and white
shooting star.</p>
<p>One of the best goat-prairie displays is <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/sna01059/index.html">Mound Prairie
SNA</a> in southeast
Minnesota, along Minnesota 16 east of Houston, near the Root River.</p>
<p>Later in May, in the hardwood forests, look for columbine,
large-flowered trillium, harebells, blue wood phlox, spiderwort, May
apple and wild geranium in the southerly forests, along with
lady's-slipper in wetter locations.</p>
<p>For many of the more rare wildflowers, go to <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/door-county-wildflowers/">Ridges
Sanctuary</a> in Door County, where you'll
find goldthread, gaywings, dwarf lake iris and bogbean. They should be
blooming during the Memorial Day weekend <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/door-county-wildflowers/">Festival of
Nature</a>.</p>
<p>In northern forests and along the shores of Lake Superior and Lake
Michigan, everything arrives a little later. In early and mid-June, look
for lady's-slipper, bluebead lily, coral root, Labrador tea, hawkweed,
bunchberry and wild rose.</p>
<p>Minnesota's North Shore has those and also such rare blooms as
butterwort; for more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/wildflowers-spring-north-shore/">Wildflowers of the North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>In north-central Minnesota, <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/lake_bemidji/index.html">Lake Bemidji State
Park</a> is
one of the best places to see the pink showy lady's slipper, which
usually blooms around Father's Day and peaks in late June.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/a/pasqueflowers.jpg" alt="Pasqueflower on the Cannon River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Pasqueflowers are first to bloom in spring, usually in mid-April.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>They're found along the park's boardwalk. Other bog plants include 
dragon's mouth orchid, buckbean, bog rosemary and insect-eating pitcher
plants and sundews.</p>
<p>The park holds weekly bog walks in June. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/bog-hikes-minnesota-wisconsin/">10 great bog
walks</a>.</p>
<h3>Birding and festivals</h3>
<p>In April and May, migrating birds return the same way they left, along
Mississippi River and Great Lakes flyways. On the Mississippi, birders
go to Minnesota's <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/frontenac/index.html">Frontenac State
Park</a> to
see warblers.</p>
<p>Novices without good binoculars can see the tiny birds up close, as
they're being banded in demonstrations at bird festivals. The <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/birds-horicon-marsh-wisconsin/">Horicon
Marsh Bird Festival</a> in
east-central Wisconsin is a good place for that.</p>
<p>People who plan to attend <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/spring-birding-festivals/">bird
festivals</a> should sign
up early for field trips and for forays with well-known naturalists,
especially at the Festival of Birds in Detroit Lakes, Minn., the
Chequamegon Bay Birding and Nature Festival out of Ashland, Wis., and
the Horicon Marsh festival.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/i/kickapoo_birders.jpg" alt="Birders in spring." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Birders watch waterfowl in the Kickapoo Valley Reserve in southwest
Wisconsin.

<h3>Morel mushrooms</h3>
<p>In the southern states, they pop out in March; everyone else has to
wait. Watch the message boards at <a href="http://www.morels.com/">Morels.com</a> ;
people love to brag about their finds.</p>
<p>Morels want sun and moisture; in most years, expect them in southern
Iowa in mid-April. Then they'll move slowly north, reaching the
southern parts of Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan by Mother's Day.</p>
<p>If you'd like help looking, sign up for the annual &quot;Morel Mushrooms
and Wildflowers in Abundance&quot; program at <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/whitewater/index.html">Whitewater State
Park</a> in
southeast Minnesota. Places go fast; call 507-932-3007.</p>
<p>You also can get your fill of morels at festivals in Michigan and
Wisconsin. For dates and tips on finding morels, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/morel-mushrooms/">Searching for
mushrooms</a>.</p>
<p>And while you're looking for morels, keep your eyes peeled for
<em>watercress</em> , which grows in clear streams, and <em>ramps</em> , a wild leek
you can fry up with the morels.</p>
