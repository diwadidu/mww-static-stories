<p>Yes, it's Wisconsin Dells. But it's not the <em>only</em> Wisconsin Dells.</p>
<p>Tourists always have been part of the scenery in this picturesque part
of Wisconsin. The first settler was a printer and publisher, and one of
the first residents was a young carpenter who crippled his right hand in
the Civil War and became a photographer.</p>
<p>H.H. Bennett loved photographing the Dells - the fantastic sandstone
formations, the shadowy gulches, the Winnebago who agreed to pose if he
beat them at moccasin. And, through Bennett's photos, tourists came to
love these things, too.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They loved it so much they came in droves, and over the years, a gantlet
of other attractions was built to draw some of their dollars. In 1952,
promoter Tommy Bartlett brought in his Water Ski and Jumping Boat Thrill
Show.</p>
<p>In 1979 came Noah's Ark Waterpark, now the largest in the nation. Theme
resorts arrived, along with magic shows and musical revues and go-cart
parks.</p>
<p>In fact, today it all looks a little like the Las Vegas Strip, with the
old brick downtown serving as Glitter Gulch.</p>
<p>Sometimes, tourists spend a whole week in Wisconsin Dells and never see
the dells.</p>
<p>The dells, however, still are there, as they have been since the end of
the last Ice Age, when an ice dam holding back the waters of a melted
glacier suddenly gave way. Over just a few days, it created a 15-mile
gorge lined with serpentine canyons and odd outcroppings.</p>
<p>Tourists have been coming to see them since 1856, when Leroy Gates
bought a rowboat and advertised excursions &quot;for the purpose of
penetrating the numerous occult caves of the Dells.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_bennett_dog_jump.jpg" alt="A dog replicates H.H. Bennett's famous Dells photo." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A dog replicates H.H. Bennett's famous 1888 stop-action photograph of
his 17-year-old son jumping to Standing Rock.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>H.H. Bennett had a rowboat, too, and used it to lug his cameras around
the dells, sometimes whitewashing the interiors of caves so they'd show
up better on his glass negatives.</p>
<p>He walked up ravines and, in winter, skated up the river. In 1871, he
discovered Witches Gulch by cutting notches into the frozen waterfall at
its entrance and climbing in.</p>
<p>When the first steamboat arrived in 1873, H.H. Bennett photographed its
passengers and sold them the pictures as souvenirs.</p>
<p>He toured the country giving &quot;magic-lantern&quot; slide shows; his famous
1888 stop-action photo of his son Ashley leaping the chasm to Stand Rock
made audiences gasp.</p>
<p>For a long time, the sights along the river and the Indian dance
ceremonials at Stand Rock were the only attractions. The local
Winnebago, to whom the dells were sacred, had been evicted but, under
Yellow Thunder, kept walking back.</p>
<p>In 1849, Yellow Thunder bought 40 acres in Delton, which served as haven
for the Winnebago until 1875, when they filed claims under the Homestead
Act and resettled in the area.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>This old Wisconsin Dells - more accurately, old Kilbourn City;
tourism-minded civic leaders renamed it in 1931 — still exists, though
the ceremonials ended in 1997.</p>
<p>There are no billboards and neon on the river, thanks to the efforts of
H.H. Bennett's daughter Nellie and her husband, George Crandall.</p>
<p>Over the years, whenever farmers wanted to sell their land, the
Crandalls bought it, tore down the barns and planted trees. They failed
in efforts to make the riverbank a national park, but their family
turned the land over to a foundation, which later sold it to the DNR.</p>
<p>Today, the boat tours still attract tourists from all over the world.
The Lower Dells tours start below the power dam, which was built in
1909, a year after Bennett's death, and raised the water level 17 feet.</p>
<p>From a colorful bevy of candy and souvenir shops, launches head past
sandy beaches lined with fishermen, especially after the opening of
sturgeon season in late summer.</p>
<p>Singing college-student guides explain that this is one of only three
places in the world where 500 million-year-old sandstone juts out of the
Earth, its softer layers eroded away into the famous formations.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/wisconsin_ducks.jpg" alt="Amphibious Ducks go into the Wisconsin River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>We learn their fanciful names: Cow in the Milk Bottle, where darker rock
forms the profile of a cow's head inside the outline of a milk bottle.
The Hawk's Bill. The Ink Stand.</p>
<p>The Sugar Bowl and Grotto Rock, with caves in which the Winnebago would
light fires and wait with spears for 5-foot sturgeon, which followed
insects attracted by the light. And there's the Baby Grand Piano,
&quot;where hard-rock music originated.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a slightly corny excursion, but it also seems far away from the
motels and souvenir shops.</p>
<p>The appearances of the Ducks are another diversion; when they trundle
out from the woods to river's edge at the base of Echo Point, everyone
watches to see if the silly-looking amphibious vehicles really float.</p>
<p>They do, and have since they were brought to the Dells in 1956.</p>
<p>There are formations on the Upper Dells, too: Black Hawk's Head, Romance
Cliff and Devil's Elbow, where lumberjacks had to nudge their log rafts
around a sharp bend.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/wisconsin_dells_beach.jpg" alt="A beach on the river in Wisconsin Dells." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On this tour, however, passengers can get off the boat and walk into the
cold, spooky recesses of Witches Gulch, where Witches Falls tumble into
Witches Bathtub near Witches Window.</p>
<p>At the end, there's a concession stand, the descendant of one started in
1877, after H.H. Bennett and a steamboat captain built boardwalks.</p>
<p>And there's a stop at 46-foot-tall Stand Rock, where a white Lab named
Paws jumps back and forth across the 5½-foot chasm — twice — for
the benefit of passengers.</p>
<p>There are other outposts of the old Dells, too. Just north of downtown,
the Thunder Valley Inn comes almost as a shock after the boisterous
strip.</p>
<p>At this former dude ranch, children's entertainment consists of a huge
pile of white sand under a tree and some goats and bunnies to pet.</p>
<p>In the restaurant, Lila from France may play the accordion, and Cristina
from Spain may do a flamenco dance in honor of a guest's birthday.

<p>Nelson's Norwegian ancestors were among the first farmers in the area,
and she grew up on a farm nearby.</p>
<p>Now she rents rooms in an 1870 farmhouse and serves huge breakfasts,
Sunday smorgasbords and threshing suppers of pot roast, garden
vegetables and home-baked bread, followed by entertainment that usually
includes daughters Kari and Sigrid on fiddle.</p>
<p>&quot;Lots of people just love these exciting Dells,&quot; Nelson says. &quot;But
some are disappointed, and we get some of those folks.&quot;</p>
<p>By running this little oasis, Nelson does her bit for the Dells she
fondly remembers from her '50s childhood.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm mainly disturbed about the downtown; I don't mind seeing the
carnival on the strip,&quot; she says. &quot;Downtown was beautiful; the main
street was all brick. All the farmers used to get their chores done
early Saturday night, so they could drive downtown, get the best parking
space and watch the tourists.&quot;</p>
<p>When guests ask for other quiet spots, she sends them down River Road to
the Dells of the Wisconsin River state natural area.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_kayaking_fall.jpg" alt="Kayaking on the Wisconsin River in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Lori Gerry</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There, a wood-chip trail leads through a meadow filled with wildflowers,
into a grove of Norway pine and down the bluff to a beautiful, secluded
beach in the Upper Dells, where sunbathers can swim and watch the tour
boats go by.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned Winnebago Indian Museum was nearby, at the junction of
River Road and Wisconsin 13. It held an assortment of heirlooms -
cradleboards, quill boxes, dresses adorned by cowrie shells and elk's
teeth — as well as newly made artisan goods.</p>
<p>Today, the local Winnebago — who, in 1994, took back their pre-fur
trade name, Ho-Chunk — run a flourishing casino on Wisconsin 12.</p>
<p>The visages of their 19th-century ancestors, meanwhile, are preserved at
the <a href="http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/hhbennett/">H.H. Bennett Studio and History
Center</a>, among thousands of
stunning photographs.</p>
<p>Bennett never achieved the cachet of an Ansel Adams or Edward Weston,
perhaps because his photos convey the accessibility of the Dells rather
than their grandiosity.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They show it as it was, and they mean the old Dells will live, no matter
how many arcades and adventure parks are built.</p>
<p>The late Jean Reese, Bennett's granddaughter, worked with the state to
make the studio Wisconsin's ninth historic site, and she and her husband
contributed $1 million in negatives, equipment, land and cash.</p>
<p>Reese said her grandfather would not be dismayed by the Dells he helped
create.</p>
<p>&quot;The river probably is better and more natural than when I was a kid,&quot;
she said. &quot;I think he'd be pleased the scenery is still there.&quot;</p>
