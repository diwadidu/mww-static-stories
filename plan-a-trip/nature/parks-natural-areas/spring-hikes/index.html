<p>One spring, I hit the nature-lover's jackpot, almost without trying.</p>
<p>Exploring a septet of Minnesota's scientific and natural areas, or
SNAs, I found more pasque flowers in bloom than I'd ever expected to
see in a lifetime.</p>
<p>I saw a panorama of the Mississippi as the Dakota would have seen it 200
years ago. I walked under the budding canopies of old-growth forests and
listened to choruses of courting frogs.</p>
<p>Wow! An SNA, it turns out, is a fantastic place to see spring at full
throttle.</p>
<p>These scientific and natural areas — in Wisconsin, state natural areas
— are good places to look for wildflowers and wildlife, like state
parks.</p>
<p>But they have no amenities beyond small parking areas and an
interpretive board; visitors are expected to tread lightly and use their
own eyes, ears and noses to find out what a site has to offer.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Not only will you be getting off the beaten path, usually there <em>is</em> no
path.</p>
<p>Set aside to make sure none of the state's ecological diversity is
lost, each natural area preserves a pocket of land that is extraordinary
in some way. Some are home to rare species or the last remnants of
prairie or Big Woods.</p>
<p>Some tell a geological story, showing signs from eras when the land was
covered by volcanoes, then a tropical sea, then sheets of ice.</p>
<p>And they're all beautiful. Unfortunately, that means it isn't easy to
protect them as the state's human population increases and fans out,
casting an acquisitive eye over the land.</p>
<p>&quot;We're competing with those who have the income and would like to put
a house in the woods or on top of a bluff,&quot; said Bob Djupstrom, retired
supervisor of the Minnesota SNA program. &quot;By the same token, more and
more people are aware of the need to protect and preserve these kinds of
places.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_leaves.jpg" alt="A leaf unfurls at the beginning of spring." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3>A great view of the Mississippi</h3>
<p>My first &quot;Wow!&quot; came at one of Pine Bend Bluffs SNA, just south of St.
Paul.</p>
<p>Parking near a trucking company just off U.S. 52 in Inver Grove Heights,
we walked along a gravel lane between two ravines and up a knoll,
emerging to a spectacular view of the Mississippi's main channel amid a
maze of islands and sloughs.</p>
<p>Hawks wheeled overhead, birds trilled from oak forest and boats puttered
by 200 feet below.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the best view of the lower Mississippi in the metro area; it's
just phenomenal,&quot; Djupstrom says. &quot;It's a great place to see eagles
in the spring and hawks in the fall.&quot;</p>
<p>But it didn't come cheaply. The site, identified as &quot;one of the last
best places&quot; by the Minnesota County Biological Survey, had a house on
it, with a deck that jutted over the bluff.</p>
<p>With the help of $500,000 from longtime SNA supporters Bruce and Ruth
Dayton and Mary Lee Dayton, the national Trust for Public Land bought
the house, tore it down, put back the dry, sandy soil that was original
to the site and planted it with prairie seeds harvested from Grey Cloud
Dunes SNA.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then, the trust offered it to the state for $240,000, which it got from
the Environmental Trust Fund.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, it's open to everybody in Minnesota and everybody who's passing
through Minnesota,&quot; Djupstrom says. &quot;You can see what the Mississippi
Valley looked like way back when.&quot;</p>
<p>From Pine Bend, we drove down U.S. 52 to Cannon Falls, where we headed
east on Minnesota 19. As we crossed the Cannon Valley Trail, we could
already see River Terrace Prairie, a mound of gravel deposited by
meltwater at the end of the last Ice Age, rising out of the river flats.</p>
<p>According to the Minnesota SNA guide, &quot;Spectacular displays of pasque
flower are found in early spring.&quot; But it was only the middle of April,
so we weren't hopeful as we followed a path beaten through yellowed
prairie grasses.</p>
<p>Then we saw a cluster of the large, delicate blooms off to our left,
nodding on feathery stems. By the time we reached the top of the ridge,
the sunny western slope was covered with thousands of the pale-lavender
flowers, so many we had to watch where we put our feet.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/cannon_river_pasqueflowers.jpg" alt="Pasqueflowers on the Cannon River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Cannon River in southeast Minnesota.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For a first sighting of spring wildflowers, it was a doozy.</p>
<p>&quot;Only gravel ridges are poor enough to offer pasques full elbow-room in
April sun,&quot; naturalist Aldo Leopold wrote in &quot;A Sand County Almanac.&quot;
&quot;They endure snows, sleets and bitter winds for the privilege of
blooming alone.&quot;</p>
<p>Not that long ago, the ridge was covered with red cedars, and only a few
pasque flowers bloomed beneath them. But, with prescribed burns to
replace the periodic fires that once occurred naturally, the original
prairie ecosystem has returned.</p>
<h3>Big Woods remnant in the suburbs</h3>
<p>A few days later, we drove out to the Twin Cities' western suburbs and
Wood-Rill SNA, most of it a gift from Bruce and Ruth Dayton. Named for a
Wordsworth poem — a rill is a brook — it's one of the last
remnants of the Big Woods, which once covered 2,000 square miles of
Minnesota.</p>
<p>The 150-acre preserve also is a souvenir from the Ice Age, with a kettle
lake called Bufflehead Pond and terrain that dips and rises.
Jack-in-the-pulpit and bellwort grew along the path, and marsh marigolds
were nearly ready to pop in a black-ash swamp.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Walking along, we sensed a vibrant layer of life humming along just
beyond our perception. As we approached a tamarack swamp and the noisy
frogs fell silent, we wished we could blend into the woodwork and just
watch.</p>
<p>According to Stan Tekiela, a Minnesota naturalist who often visits SNAs
while working on his field guides to amphibians, wildflowers, trees,
birds and mammals, that's exactly what visitors should do if they have
the time.</p>
<p>&quot;When you show up, all the local wildlife freezes,&quot; Tekiela says.
&quot;What you have to do is sit down, settle in and wait for them to return
to their normal rhythm. Just sit back and lean against a tree; that's
the most productive way to see these things.&quot;</p>
<p>Our next stop was one of Tekiela's favorites, Wolsfeld Woods, only a
few miles away. Settled in 1855 by three brothers from Germany, it was
used to produce maple syrup.</p>
<p>It was bought for development in 1961 but in 1978 was donated to the
Nature Conservancy, which has helped Minnesota and Wisconsin acquire
many of their most spectacular SNAs.</p>
<p>Violets and pale-pink rue anemone grew along the path, which we followed
to rush-lined Wolsfeld Lake. From there, we climbed a path at the top of
a ravine, through which a creek meandered.</p>
<p>Then, we got lost in the old-growth woods, finding our way back to the
parking lot only with the help of traffic noise from County Road 6.</p>

and Hokah in Minnesota bluff country.

<h3>Wildflowers on the St. Croix</h3>
<p>We returned to prairie the following week,  and by then, spring already
had taken a giant leap forward.</p>
<p>On the St. Croix Savanna SNA near Stillwater, a gravel prairie high
above the St. Croix River south of Bayport, the pasque flowers were
gone, the oaks were dripping with chartreuse baby leaves and the
raspberry shoots had turned bright red.</p>
<p>Velvety pussytoes had sprung up along the path, and violets flourished
on the southern slope.</p>
<p>Farther south, eight miles beyond Afton, we found more violets at Lost
Valley SNA and, we thought, a tiny white draba bloom — &quot;Sand too poor
and sun too weak for bigger, better blooms are good enough for Draba,&quot;
Leopold wrote.</p>
<p>Just overhead, a red-tailed hawk put on a show for us, coasting along on
warm breezes, and we stood atop one ridge, gazing across a river of
grass at another ridge that was studded with limestone boulders.</p>
<p>The site was poor farmland, but today it supports a rich collection of
prairie wildflowers and grasses, and we made a mental note to come back
later in the year.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/o/ionas_beach.jpg" alt="Iona's beach natural area on the North Shore." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

sometimes "sing."
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Our last stop was Grey Cloud Dunes SNA in Cottage Grove, where a brisk
20-minute walk took us down a hill into a sumac grove, under a railroad
track, through a grassy meadow, past a copse of oak and out onto the
banks of the Mississippi, where we annoyed a pair of geese.</p>
<p>It was a lovely spring stroll, perfumed by apple blossoms; by summer,
it's overflowing with plants that thrive in a dry, sandy environment.</p>
<p>In May, spring blooms still are found in abundance under the forest
canopy and on prairies.</p>
<p>Some of the best are in far southeastern bluff country. At Mound Prairie
SNA between Hokah and Houston (see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/wildflowers-bluff-country/">Road trip: Wildflowers of the
Mississippi Valley</a> ), visitors
find woodland ephemerals as well as prairie flowers flourishing on
sun-bathed goat prairie.</p>
<p>Others that have woodland and prairie wildflowers, as well as mosses and
ferns, include Zumbro Falls Woods, along the Zumbro River east of
Zumbrota; and Townsend Woods, a patch of Big Woods that's just north of
Sakatah Lake State Park, west of Faribault.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/a/parfreys_glen9.jpg" alt="Walking to Parfrey's Glen." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Devil's Lake State Park in Wisconsin, Parfrey's Glen was the
state's first natural area.

<h3>An abundance in Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Wisconsin also has superb natural areas. Started in 1951, its program
got a 23-year head start on Minnesota, giving it 687 sites to
Minnesota's 166.</p>
<p>Its sites include many of the state's headliner attractions: the Dells
of the Wisconsin River, the Dalles of the St. Croix, Brady's Bluff
Prairie in Perrot State Park, Big Bay Sand Spit and Bog on Madeline
Island, the Mink River Estuary in Door County.</p>
<p>Door County alone has more than 25 state natural areas, tucked amid the
better-known state and county parks.</p>
<p>Wisconsin's very first SNA in 1951 was Parfrey's Glen in the Baraboo
Hills. That's one of my favorite spots in the whole region, a narrow,
otherworldly gorge whose moss-covered rock walls are embedded with
plum-puddingstone.</p>
<p>At all these sites, familiarity breeds affection. There's so much going
on there we want to come back and check in every once in a while to see
what's new. In that way, they're a little like old friends.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/list.html">Minnesota SNAs</a>:</strong> &quot;A Guide
to Minnesota's Scientific and Natural Areas&quot; includes a statewide map
and location maps for the 166 sites.</p>
<p>You can follow the Minnesota SNAs on their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MinnesotaSNAs/">Facebook
page</a>. There's also a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/groups/minnesota_snas">Flickr
group</a> with lots of
alluring photos.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/lands/naturalareas/">Wisconsin SNAs</a>:</strong>
Wisconsin has 687 state natural areas. The guidebook &quot;Wisconsin,
Naturally&quot; includes a statewide map and location maps for 150 of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.michigan.gov/dnr/places/natural-areas"><strong>Michigan
SNAs</strong></a>: Michigan has 46 natural areas, many of them in such familiar places as
the Porcupine Mountains and Ludington Dunes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.iowadnr.gov/Places-to-Go/State-Preserves"><strong>Iowa State
Preserves</strong></a>:
Like state natural areas, the 95 Iowa preserves protect outstanding
biological and geological features and also historical and
archaeological features.</p>
<p><em>What to do:</em> The sites have paths worn down by hikers, but it's
better to spread out to lessen the impact of your visit (except in such
sites as Wolsfeld Woods, which asks hikers to keep to paths).</p>
<p>Watch out for ticks; it helps to wear light-colored clothes, so they
show up as they try to find a lodging site.</p>
<p>Bring a bag to pick up trash, especially at such sites as Grey Cloud
Dunes.</p>
<p>If you like the SNA you have visited, tell your state legislator so the
program can continue to get funding.</p>
<p><em>What not to do:</em>  Dogs aren't allowed, except on such sites as
Wood-Rill in Orono, and then only on a leash.</p>
<p>Picnicking is not allowed, though hikers can sit on a rock or stump and
have a sandwich and drink carried in a backpack.</p>
<p>Picking wildflowers or morel mushrooms is not allowed.</p>
