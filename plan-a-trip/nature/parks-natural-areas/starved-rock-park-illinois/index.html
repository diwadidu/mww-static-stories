<h2>In northern Illinois, a state park draws crowds to its forest canyons and riverside cliffs.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/starved_rock_overhang_steps.jpg" alt="Steps to Council Overhang." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Like many places, Starved Rock State Park has a name whose origin is
lost in the mists of time.</p>
<p>Supposedly, the Potawatomi and Ottawa trapped a band of Illini on a
125-foot butte along the Illinois River. However, anyone who's actually
climbed up Starved Rock — and millions of tourists have — can see
that no one could defend it long enough to starve.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox,&quot; says Kathy Higdon of the
Illinois Waterway Visitor Center across the river. &quot;It's a legend, like
the Lover's Leaps we've got all over the place.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Carved</em> Rock would make more sense. At
the end of the last Ice Age, a flood of glacial meltwater ate away the
softest rock along its path, turning the riverside cliffs into Swiss
cheese.</p>
<p>The water also cut a string of 18 canyons, which seem like mirages in
the middle of Illinois farmland.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Easily reached by park trails, they're cool refuges with towering walls
of sandstone, carved in the eerily skeletal style also seen in
underground caves. From clefts atop cliffs, water cascades into pools,
some with beaches of white sand that has sloughed off the soft walls.</p>
<p>These canyons have drawn visitors ever since Marquette and Jolliet
passed by on their way back from the Mississippi in 1673.</p>
<p>Across the river, the French explorers found a village of 1,000
hospitable Illini farmers, for whom their arrival marked the beginning
of the end.</p>
<p>The Illini began to die of European diseases, and the fur post the
French established drew hostile Iroquois armed by the English. After
less than 20 years, they fled south.</p>
<p>The tourism era at Starved Rock began when an entrepreneur built a
Victorian hotel and dance hall along the river at the turn of the 19th
century. It struggled, and in 1911, he sold the land to the state for a
park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/starved_rock_lodge2.jpg" alt="Starved Rock Lodge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The lodge was built in the 1930s by CCC workers.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>During the Depression, Civilian Conservation Corps workers built roads,
bridges and trails, and also a timber lodge and cabins on the bluff.</p>
<p>The lodge has been embellished and expanded over the years, and now
guests can forgo the outdoors and spend their time getting a massage,
lounging in the sauna, listening to live music, taking trolley tours and
dining in the timber-beamed Great Hall.</p>
<p>Down by the river, day trippers like to hang out on the rolling lawn of
the Visitor Center, grilling, playing Frisbee and eating ice cream from
the concession stand.</p>
<p>But Starved Rock's magic is in its canyons. The closest to the lodge is
St. Louis Canyon, less than half an hour by foot along the Bluff Trail.</p>
<p>Spring is gorgeous at Starved Rock, and on Mother's Day, so many spring
beauties were blooming that the grass and forest floor looked sprinkled
with white confetti.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The first canyon I passed was Aurora, a narrow slot with golden walls
only partly visible from the trail. From there, the trail wound up to
the blufftop, and I could see the town of Utica across the river.</p>
<p>At my feet I saw a clump of jeweled shooting star, then another, and
another. It was one of the best displays of this elegant wildflower I've
seen; it's not rare, but it's not common, either.</p>
<p>From the bluff, the trail wound down and around to St. Louis Canyon. It
was a shady, rock-lined room in the middle of forest, with a stream of
water tumbling from the clifftop into a pool. Teen-agers sank onto a
downed log and stared at it, mesmerized, and smaller kids darted in and
out of shallow caves in the rock walls.</p>
<p>I had to get back for the Sunday trolley tour, which gives an overview
of the park, the town of Utica, the Illinois &amp; Michigan Canal and the
Illinois Waterway Visitor Center.</p>
<p>The center adjoins the Starved Rock lock and dam, one of eight that take
barges over the 163-foot drop from Lake Michigan to the Mississippi.</p>
<p>The driver supplied us with an eclectic narration that was stronger on
personal experience and opinion than context and history; people who
prefer dates and facts will have to dig them up later.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/starved_rock_illinois_canyon_trail.jpg" alt="Bluebells on the Illinois Canyon Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bluebells line the trail to Illinois Canyon.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We did learn about the Utica buildings destroyed in a 2004 tornado, the
1960 murders of three women in St. Louis Canyon and the history of the
I&amp;M Canal, as read off the plaque in front of the Lasalle County
Historical Museum.</p>
<p>I would have liked to hear about the 61½-mile crushed-limestone bicycle
trail just on the other side of the canal. It follows the former
towpath, now a national heritage corridor, all the way from nearby
LaSalle to the edge of Joliet. It looked inviting.</p>
<p>Instead, we headed east along the river to the Illinois Waterway Center,
where we watched the towboat Terri C. being lowered 19 feet toward
Peoria.</p>
<p>The center's Kathy Higdon was more informative, telling me about river
traffic — the most common cargo is chemicals, she said — and the six
tribes of the Illini confederacy. Archaeologists have found a trove of
artifacts just upriver at the Grand Village of the Kaskaskia, a national
historic landmark that's closed to the public.</p>
<p>The rock columns of Starved Rock and Lover's Leap were right across from
us, and Plum Island rose from the river in terraces.</p>
<p>That's where the Kaskaskia farmed, Higdon said; now, it's owned by the
Audubon Society and is a sanctuary for bald eagles, who like to pick off
fish at the bottom of the dam.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/starved_rock_ottawa_canyon.jpg" alt="Ottawa Canyon in Starved Rock State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Children play at the edge of the pool in Ottawa Canyon.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Back in the trolley, our driver told us the tired old story of Lover's
Leap and the Indian brave and maiden's doomed love. He added, &quot;Every
four or five years, some drunk will jump off it and break a leg. They
don't die, but they do get arrested.&quot;</p>
<p>That I believed. Our next stop was the park visitor center, where we
were supposed to see a short movie. But it was unavailable, so our
driver passed out slivers of fudge instead.</p>
<p>After the tour, I drove to the three canyons on the east end of the
park. The first stop on the trail was Council Overhang, a gigantic
natural bandshell with striated walls of yellow and white sandstone and
black smoke stains where, presumably, councils were held.</p>
<p>At Ottawa Canyon, the cliffs were so soft they were turning into sand,
with grains clinging to their surface like sawdust.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Bluebells created a blue haze on the moist canyon floors and lined the
streams, mingling with horsetail rushes. Stray buttercups added a waxy
splash of yellow, and I spotted a robust Jack in the pulpit.</p>
<p>Children played at the edge of a shallow, muddy pool. In Kaskaskia
Canyon, the pool was deeper and clear, and ferns cascaded off the
north-facing wall. A glaringly white patch showed where a slab had
fallen to the ground; already it was a pile of sand.</p>
<p>These mysterious little niches full of rock, sand and water are a kids'
paradise. Parents in the know had given their children Crocs or old
sneakers to wear, because nagging is just cruel when there's so much
for a kid to explore.</p>
<p>I wished I had water sandals myself at Illinois Canyon, reached only by
fording several streams on haphazardly arranged bridges of branches and
rocks. It's an adventure, though; at one point, I heard cheers behind
me as a group successfully crossed.</p>
<p>Illinois Canyon is a long, oval bowl with rock outcroppings the size of
a beached ocean liner. When I finally made my way to the inevitable pool
at its far end, I smiled when I saw Jack and Annette Hovland, whose path
I'd been crossing all day.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The Muscatine, Iowa, couple also were visiting Starved Rock for the
first time.</p>
<p>&quot;This is amazing,&quot; Annette said. &quot;I don't know why we didn't take
our kids here when they were young.&quot;</p>
<p>The park celebrated its 110th birthday in 2021. It's already a favorite
of millions, but word still is spreading fast.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: <a href="http://www.starvedrockstatepark.org/">Starved Rock State Park</a> in northern Illinois</h3>
<p><strong>Getting there:</strong> The park is across the
Illinois River from Utica, just south of Interstate 80. It's 95 miles
from Chicago.</p>
<p>On summer weekends, <strong>parking lots often fill by midday, so go early in
the day.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When to go:</strong> In spring, waterfalls tumble into canyons filled with
Virginia bluebells and other wildflowers.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/starved_rock_lock.jpg" alt="Starved Rock lock on the Illinois River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A towboat moves through the Starved Rock lock.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In summer, the canyons stay cool. In fall, the hardwood forests provide
color. The park becomes extremely busy on October weekends, and parking
areas fill quickly.</p>
<p>In winter, there are ice falls in the canyons, and as many as 75 eagles
congregate around the dam, where water stays open.</p>
<p><strong>Admission:</strong> Like all Illinois state parks, it's free.</p>
