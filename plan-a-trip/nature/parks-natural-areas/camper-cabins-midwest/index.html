<h2>In state and county parks and forests, visitors love their camper cabins.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitetail_woods_gagner.jpg" alt="Camper cabins in Dakota County." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Debra Gagner</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Whitetail Woods camper cabins in Dakota County are very popular.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For people who love the outdoors, luxury is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
<p>Is it a Jacuzzi or a latrine? A four-course breakfast or a fire ring?</p>
<p>The answer is not so obvious. If the choice also includes starry skies,
silence and snow-laden pines, many folks would take a camper cabin over
a fancy inn, even if they have to use vault toilets and cook over a
fire.</p>
<p>Minnesota's camper cabins are so popular many people reserve them as
soon as reservations open, 120 days in advance.</p>
<p>The 12- by 16-foot log cabins have bunk beds, a table and chairs, and
many have screened porches, electricity and heat. There's always water,
and in summer, guests can use campground shower facilities.</p>
<p>In winter, campers have to stay a little grubbier, but miles of skiing
and snowshoeing trails outside their doors make up for it.</p>

<p>One January, my husband and I stayed in one of Minnesota's most popular
camper cabins. Most of the state's cabins are cute, but some parks are
more scenic than others.</p>
<p>Of those, Jay Cooke, straddling the St. Louis River near Duluth, has to
be near the top of the heap.</p>
<p>When we were there, new snow had coated every branch and flocked every
bough in the park, creating a classic winter wonderland.</p>
<p>The park staff had left a bundle of wood on our porch, and we built a
fire and stared into it for hours, watching sparks jump high into the
sky to meet the stray flakes drifting down.</p>
<p>Carefully stacking our slabs, we were as entertained as children playing
with Legos, until our toys ran out. Then, we climbed into our sleeping
bags and read as trains whistled from the rail line that still follows
the park's borders.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/bemidji_park_cabin.jpg" alt="A camper cabin in Lake Bemidji State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In northern Minnesota, Lake Bemidji State Park has four camper cabins.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The cabins help fill in for the modest mom-and-pop resorts to which
vacationing Minnesota families used to return year after year.</p>
<p>A cherished part of state history, they've disappeared by the
thousands; often, an entire resort is replaced by just one vacation
home, whose owners may use it for only a few weeks a year.</p>
<p>Nothing will replace the old resorts. But for Annika Fjelstad and her
family,  the camper cabins come close. Since her sons were born,
they've stayed at the Wild River State Park cabins up to three times a
year, often renting an adjoining cabin for use as a guesthouse.</p>
<p>&quot;It was part of our commitment to the kids, to let them know and love
at least one place where they know they really belong,&quot; says Fjelstad,
who once worked as a wilderness guide. &quot;It gives them a sense of
stability; it's kind of like going home to the woods.</p>
<p>&quot;People who own a cabin have that experience, too, but this is more
affordable and convenient,&quot; she says. &quot;And we like sharing our cabin
with the state of Minnesota when we're not using it.&quot;</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Camper cabins in state parks and forests</h3>
<p>To rent a private cabin, cottage or guesthouse, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages">Cabins &amp;
Cottages</a> stories.</p>
<p>For information about yurts in state parks, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/yurts-minnesota-michigan-iowa/">A yen for
yurts</a>.</p>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/index.html">Minnesota state
parks</a>: Minnesota
has 108 <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/camper_cabins.html">camper
cabins</a> at
29 state parks; handicapped-accessible cabins sleep five, and others
sleep six.</p>
<p>Most of the cabins (and a few yurts) are in campgrounds, accessible by
car, but some are along trails, and gear must be carried in. Each cabin
has bunks with mattresses and a table with benches.</p>
<p>Each has a picnic table and fire ring, and a vault toilet and water
source is nearby. In summer, guests can use campground showers.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/f/afton_camper_cabin.jpg" alt="A camper cabin at Afton State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The camper cabins in Afton State Park, just east of St. Paul, are right
on the ski trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Guests must bring their own bedding. It's also a good idea to bring a
container for water, biodegradable soap for washing and a reading lamp.
Candles are not allowed.</p>
<p>Cabins with electricity have many outlets, but guests are not supposed
to use coffeemakers or crockpots. Pets are not allowed inside cabins.
Campers are expected to sweep the floor and wipe off the table and
mattresses before they leave.</p>
<p>Cost is $80-$90. There's also a reservation fee, $7 online, $10
phone.</p>
<p>Most heated cabins are year-round, but some are seasonal.</p>
<p>At Upper Sioux Agency and Blue Mounds state parks, unheated
<a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/tipi.html">tipis</a> that sleep
six rent for $35, and there are wall tents at Afton and Myre-Big
Island, $35-$40. Afton, Glendalough and Cuyuna Country have
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/yurts.html">yurts</a> with
wood-burning stoves that sleep five to seven people and cost $65-$70.</p>
<p>Some cabins are wheelchair-accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://reservemn.usedirect.com/MinnesotaWeb/">Reservations</a> can be
made 120 days in advance online or at 866-857-2757, toll-free in the
United States and Canada. Reservations can be made starting at 8 a.m.
