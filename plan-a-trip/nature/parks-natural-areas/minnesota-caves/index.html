<p>Under the cornstalks of Fillmore County, an unusual sculpture garden
sits in shadow.</p>
<p>Stalagmite topiaries line walkways, alongside pale-green flowstone as
translucent as Chinese jade. Stalactite statuettes dangle in artistic
arrays.</p>
<p>They're obviously created by a Pollock of rock, a Van Gogh of stone. Yet
their genius relies not on the medium — water, applied one drop at a
time — but on eons worth of time.</p>
<p>A billion years ago, the floor of this underground garden was the silty
muck on the bottom of a tropical sea, encrusted with the shells of
mollusks. Over time, it compressed into porous limestone, cut through by
underground streams.</p>
<p>Rain, acid and gases ate cavities in the stone, and the streams carved
twisting labyrinths, picking up minerals that colored the walls —
manganese for purple and brown, iron oxide for red and orange, calcite
for white and yellow.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Rivulets laden with these minerals dripped into the cavities, spreading
tapestries of flowstone along the walls, glistening stalactites overhead
and nubby stalagmites on the ground.</p>
<p>They're still growing, as are the chalk-white soda straws — baby
stalactites, lengthening by an inch a century — that carpet ceilings.</p>
<p>Niagara Cave was discovered in 1924, when three pigs disappeared from a
farm near Harmony. The farmer, looking for his missing pigs, found a
sinkhole — a spot where the thin layer of limestone under the soil has
collapsed — and sent some neighbor boys down by rope.</p>
<p>Seventy-five feet later, they found the pigs — still alive — and a
huge labyrinth of underground canyons. Tours began in 1934 and still
start from the pigs' landing spot, the Reception Room.</p>
<p>Mystery Cave was discovered on a frigid day in 1937, by a man walking
along the South Branch of the Root River. Because the air inside the
cave is 48 degrees Fahrenheit year-round, it had melted the snow on the
ground around a sinkhole, and steam was rising from it.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/niagara_cave.jpg" alt="Niagara Cave near Harmony." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>He found a whole system of caverns, and tours of Mystery Cave, now part
of a Forestville/Mystery Cave State Park, started 10 years later.</p>
<p>In summer, a visit to these underground caverns is a good way to beat
the heat, since the air always is a bracing 48 degrees.</p>
<p>The cold also is responsible for Fillmore County's status as a
trout-fishing mecca; water that takes a short cut through the caves
rejoins the South Branch of the Root River chilled to 48 degrees,
allowing trout to thrive.</p>
<p>&quot;If it weren't for the caves, you'd have to pack up and go to Montana to
find trout,&quot; says Chris Ingebretsen, a DNR naturalist who begins his
tours by showing visitors the nearly dry bed of the South Branch as it
skirts the caves.</p>
<p>The surrounding countryside, he said, looks ordinary, even bucolic. But
appearances are deceiving.</p>
<p>&quot;It's karst topography, which means there's fractured limestone right
under the surface, and water drops down into the fractures and
disappears,&quot; he said. &quot;It's odd country — there's not a lot of solid
ground in Fillmore County.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Ingebretsen was leading a tour of Minnesota Caverns, also known as
Mystery 2; there's also a Mystery 3, he said, along the 13-mile system.</p>
<p>Most people who go on the Mystery 2 tour, held only on summer weekends,
already know something about caves. My group was handy with answers —
&quot;What forms stalagmites?&quot; &quot;Water dripping off stalactites!&quot; and &quot;How
do bats navigate?&quot; &quot;Echo location!&quot;</p>
<p>He described the sculpting powers of water, aided by carbonic acid, also
used in soda pop — &quot;Most people don't give a lot of thought to the
fact they're drinking something that makes rock dissolve&quot; — and led
us through triangular rooms.</p>
<p>On the walls, fossilized worm burrows created a Swiss-cheese effect.
Pure-white helictites twisted and curled, and a beautiful, pale-orange
carrot stalactite (think &quot;c,&quot; for &quot;ceiling&quot;) reached toward the
floor.</p>
<p>One pale-green, translucent stalagmite (think &quot;g,&quot; for ground&quot;) looked
just like the Minneapolis Institute of Art's famous &quot;Jade Mountain.&quot;</p>
<p>At the end of the two-hour tour, we emerged into daylight, our chilled
hands tingling in the summer heat.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/cave_baconstrips.jpg" alt="Flowstone in a cave." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
This kind of flowstone often is called "bacon strips."
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The one-hour tours of Mystery Cave are held daily in summer and hold
another set of oddly shaped wall patterns, evocative stalactites, 5-foot
fossils — and bats, 2,000 of which hibernate in the cave.</p>
<p>For many visitors, they're the highlight, and on my tour, we could see
furry little clusters of them snoozing in nearly every chamber.</p>
<p>Bats, explained naturalist Angela McKay, use sound waves to find
mosquitoes to eat and obviously have no problem knowing where people
are, as long as the people don't move suddenly.</p>
<p>We must have been listening, because when two bats started zooming
around we just stood and watched.</p>
<p>&quot;You're much calmer than most people when bats are flying around,&quot;
McKay told us.</p>
<p>They weren't the only residents of the cave. On lovely Turquoise Lake,
its surface perfectly reflecting the ceiling, McKay pointed out white
specks sitting on calcite rafts — springtails, a wingless insect that
survives on lint and dead skin cells brought in by visitors.</p>
<p>Twenty-two miles southeast, less than a mile from the Iowa border,
Niagara Cave traditionally has had the goofier tours, in the grand
tradition of 1950s-style kitsch.</p>
<p>But then former Rochester real-estate agent Mark Bishop, who has a
degree in earth sciences, bought the cave and adjoining house and gift
shop.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/a/harmony_gift_shops.jpg" alt="Gift shops in Harmony." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>&quot;Paul Bunyan moved out when I moved in,&quot; Bishop said with a laugh,
referring to the narrow ledge dubbed &quot;Paul Bunyan's bed&quot; by previous
guides. &quot;I wanted the tours to be a little educational, and also fun.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, the cave glows with lighting so artfully arranged that each
chamber and passageway has the shadowed elegance of an Ansel Adams
photo. &quot;I spent three winters up in the crevices, arranging the
lights,&quot; Bishop says.</p>
<p>Still, the cave has formations that really do look like an Elephant's
Head, a three-tier Wedding Cake and a battleship, and guides point them
out.</p>
<p>They also show visitors a frighteningly realistic, five-fingered
skeleton's hand: &quot;Some guides, they'll tell you this is what they'll do
to you if you touch the walls,&quot; teased our guide, high-school student
Amanda Bruggman.</p>
<p>When people touch a formation, their fingers give it a layer of oil that
makes dripping water slide off, and the formation stops growing. That
didn't stop the boy in front of me from touching one — &quot;Oh, who
cares,&quot; he muttered under his breath.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Niagara Cave also has a 60-foot waterfall, viewed from a suspended
walkway; twisting Cathedral Dome, formed by a whirlpool; and a 625-foot
Grand Canyon room — all features that make people say, &quot;Wow.&quot;</p>
<p>My own favorite feature was a rock passageway, indented as if a giant
had pressed his thumb into clay thousands of times.</p>
<p>I'm also partial to the ribbon stalactites, also known as cave bacon,
and the sharks-tooth stalactites, fat on one side and skinny on the
other.</p>
<p>In these caves, there's a masterpiece around every corner. They weren't
created by chisel or brush, but a visitor's reaction to them — awe —
is always just the same.</p>
