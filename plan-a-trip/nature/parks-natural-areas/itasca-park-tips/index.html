<h2>For generations, Itasca has been a sacred spot to Minnesotans.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_firetower.jpg" alt="The view from Itasca's fire tower." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Aiton Heights Fire Tower Trail includes a great view from the tower.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Minnesota's early days, creating a park was no picnic.</p>
<p>As the public admired the towering pines around Lake Itasca, loggers
dreamed of the miles of board feet they could produce.</p>
<p>&quot;No measure was ever more unreasonably harassed and opposed,&quot; wrote
park founder Jacob Brower. But in 1891, the Legislature gave the people
their first state park by one vote.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the loggers got most of the trees.</p>
<p>They might have done them all in if it hadn't been for people like
24-year-old Mary Gibbs, who in 1903 became North America's first female
park commissioner after the death of her father.</p>
<p>That spring, with rising water threatening to swamp Itasca's pines, she
asked loggers to open their dam gates to lower water levels, as required
by law.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The armed superintendent threatened to shoot her if she put her hand on
the levers, but she did anyway, famously declaring, &quot;I will put my hand
there, and you will not shoot it off, either.&quot;</p>
<p>Water levels went down, but soon logging lawyers got a court order to
keep her away from the dam, and she resigned her post. Under the new
park commissioner, logging around Itasca continued for another 14 years.</p>
<p>Things worked out in the end — that is, it's hard to imagine how the
public could adore Itasca State Park any more than it already does.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a memory maker,&quot; says Terri Dinesen, manager of another
Minnesota state park who was visiting Itasca on her weekend off. &quot;It's
just one of those mile-marker, gotta-come-back kind of things.&quot;</p>
<p>Only the second state park in the nation, after Niagara Falls in New
York, Itasca contains more than a quarter of the state's old-growth
pines outside the Boundary Waters. That draws Minnesotans, who tramp
through the groves inhaling the heady perfume of pine.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_headwaters_girl.jpg" alt="Kids at the Itasca headwaters." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Kids love to run across the rocks that mark the start of the
Mississippi.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But they also join the pilgrimage to the source of the Mississippi,
which draws people from around the world.</p>
<p>A line of boulders marks the point at which the river trickles out of
the lake and begins its 2,318-mile journey to the Gulf of Mexico, and
few schoolchildren from Minnesota or anywhere else can resist picking
their way across the boulders so they can shout, &quot;I walked across the
Mississippi!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I grew up thinking of it as a rite of passage, somewhere between
baptism and confirmation,&quot; says Gene Merriam, former commissioner of
Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources.</p>
<p>For many years, the headwaters was marked only by a 1930s plaque; now,
there's also a center named for Mary Gibbs, with a restaurant, gift
shop and plaza lined with exhibits, many featuring Gibbs'
turn-of-the-century photographs.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Almost from the beginning, Itasca was known as &quot;Minnesota's Own
Resort.&quot; Gibbs' last act as commissioner was ordering the logs for
Douglas Lodge, a rustic but genteel hostelry that had its own post
office until 1952.</p>
<p>Log guest cabins also were built, and people on a budget could stay at
the Bear Paw Campground, which still holds the ice house where campers
stocked their coolers with lake ice packed in sawdust.</p>
<p>Itasca is still Minnesota's own resort, the highlight of a summer. Of
all Minnesota's state parks, it has by far the most overnight visitors.</p>
<p>Luckily, it takes just a weekend to see many of Itasca's highlights.
Here are the top five.</p>
<h3>Explore the headwaters</h3>
<p>The new exhibits answer some perennial questions: Who discovered the
true source of the Mississippi? Why was it so hard to find?</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_lake_headwaters.jpg" alt="Lake Itasca and the headwaters." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The waters of Lake Itasca supply the fledgling Mississippi.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>After the Treaty of Paris in 1783, the U.S. needed to fix its western
boundaries, so the race was on to find the start of the Mississippi. In
1798, English surveyor David Thompson claimed it was Turtle Lake, near
Bemidji.</p>
<p>Lt. Zebulon Pike said it was Leech Lake, Lewis Cass said it was Cass
Lake and Giacomo Beltrami said it was Lake Julia.</p>
<p>But a young man who had been on Cass' 1820 exhibition noticed that Cass
Lake had two inlets, and in 1832, he returned to Cass Lake and asked an
Ojibwe man named Ozawindib to lead him to the river's real source.</p>
<p>Henry Schoolcraft got the credit and concocted a name for the lake by
putting together parts of two Latin words, <em>verITAS CAput</em>, or &quot;true head.&quot;</p>
<p>But as one of the new exhibits notes, Schoolcraft was simply one of the
few explorers smart enough to ask someone who knew.</p>
<p>Even so, Schoolcraft's claim was disputed until 1888, when Jacob Brower
was sent by the Minnesota Historical Society to survey the lake. A
drought that year showed him that the five creeks flowing into Lake
Itasca had nearly dried up, but the one flowing out stayed fairly
constant.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_canoeing.jpg" alt="Canoeing at Itasca." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Canoeists paddle on Lake Itasca.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The direction in which the stream flowed had fooled everyone. From
Itasca, the river flows north to Lake Bemidji, then heads east through
Cass Lake and Lake Winnibigoshish.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to convince people the river flows north,&quot; an Itasca
naturalist said. &quot;I've actually had people argue with me about it.
It's a weird concept.&quot;</p>
<p>Early explorers also were fooled by the swamplike nature of the first 50
river miles; the river barely has a current after spring's high waters.
Canoeists regularly get lost there.</p>
<p>Every year, canoeists, kayakers and bicyclists start cross-country treks
at the head-waters; once, a swimmer made the trip.</p>
<p>But most people at the headwaters are content to pick their way across
the boulders that separate lake from river or to wade for a few yards
through the pristine water.</p>
<p>Today, the channel is lined with grasses and wildflowers, and pebbles
cover its bottom. This is a gussied-up version of the nascent
Mississippi; in its natural state, it was a muddy swamp, before 1930s
Civilian Conservation Corps crews revamped it with tons of rock and
fill.</p>
<h3>Cruise the lake on the Chester Charles</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_cruise.jpg" alt="The Chester Charles excursion boat in Itasca." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A narrated tour on the Chester Charles is a good way to spot wildlife,
especially bald eagles.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Don't miss this narrated 1½-hour trip around the lake. Guides are savvy
about nature and park history and have an unerring eye for wildlife,
picking out loons, deer, herons and eagles for passengers to watch.</p>
<p>Our guide was Kim Coborn, who said passengers on 85 percent of her trips
see bald eagles. As she drew the boat closer, an eagle hopped onto a
downed tree, where it sat for a while before flapping away.</p>
<p>Eagles know a steady flow of tourists into the park means a ready source
of roadkill, so they'll stick around until nearby farmers start to
clear their fields and it's easier for them to find mice. &quot;They're
not a very ambitious bird,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Interspersed with the steady narration is the Ojibwe point of view as
well as Ojibwe words — <em>migizi</em> ,
eagle; <em>shingobee</em>, pine; <em>manoomin</em>, wild rice.</p>
<p>Passing the headwaters, which would have been hidden behind grasses in
Schoolcraft's day, Coborn remarked on the agent's luck.</p>
<p>&quot;If it hadn't been for Ozawindib and his people, Schoolcraft may never
have found the source,&quot; she said. &quot;You can no more say Schoolcraft
discovered Itasca than you can say Christopher Columbus truly discovered
America.&quot;</p>
<h3>Ride around the park on a bike</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_biking.jpg" alt="Bicycling in Itasca State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicyclists can circle the park on paths and Wilderness Drive.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This is the best way to see the park and to get from one place to
another. Five miles of twisting and rolling paved bike path follow the
East Arm of Lake Itasca, past Douglas Lodge, Preachers Grove and through
Bear Paw Campground.</p>
<p>On the North Arm, it passes the Pioneer Cemetery, the beach and the 1893
ruins and replica of Theodore Wegmann's cabin and general store, where
the early settler sold postcards, candy and ice cream to tourists.</p>
<p>Passing the headwaters, the path joins Wilderness Drive, which soon
becomes one-way. Gliding under a canopy of trees, cyclists can stop to
see the largest white pine and the largest red pine, as well as hike
half a mile to Bohall Lake.</p>
<p>Near the end of the drive, a half-mile gravel path leads to the Aiton
Heights Fire Tower, which takes climbers above the treetops.</p>
<p>The loop is 17 miles, a great way to spend an afternoon. Itasca Sports
Rentals supplies very nice mountain bikes from its spot on the lake,
near the beach.</p>
<p>Be careful when many people, especially children, are using the bike
path, whose ups and downs often obscure oncoming traffic.</p>
<h3>Hike the trails</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_lake.jpg" alt="Hikers on Kasey Lake in Itasca." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Hikers take a break along Kasey Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From the headwaters, the mile-long <em>Schoolcraft Trail</em> follows the other
side of the North Arm, ending at Hill Point, where a timber fence
protects an Ojibwe cemetery.</p>
<p>From the point, hikers can gaze upon Schoolcraft Island, where, on his
short but fateful trip to the lake, the Indian agent had lunch, put up a
flag and hurried off to fulfill the official purpose of his visit, which
included vaccinating Ojibwe children for smallpox.</p>
<p>To get a sense for what northern Minnesota was like before the loggers
came, hike the half-mile <em>Bohall Trail</em> to Bohall Lake, off Wilderness
Drive. There are more giant pines along the <em>Nicollet Trail</em> , which
starts off Wilderness Drive near Elk Lake.</p>
<p>The most popular trail is the <em>Dr. Roberts Nature Trail</em> , which starts
from the lakeshore at the foot of Douglas Lodge. It's a two-mile loop,
first passing across a bog on its way to the Old-Timer's Cabin, which a
CCC crew built with four giant logs in the winter of 1933-34.</p>
<p>In spring, hikers can spot showy lady's-slippers along the trail, where
special features are marked by numbers explained in a take-along guide.</p>
<h3>Visit the Jacob V. Brower Visitors Center</h3>
<p>This handsome center near the south entrance is filled with all kinds of
park memorabilia.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's the Douglas Lodge's lady's-slipper china and its original
guest book, with such comments as a 1924 entry: &quot;For one who sees
nothing but cornfields, the pines are a wonderful treat.&quot;</p>
<p>The famous standoff at the dam site is chronicled, with a letter of
support to Gibbs from the aging Jacob Brower: &quot;I sincerely hope the
reports in the papers concerning your energetic defense of the beauties
of Itasca Park are correct . . . Someone ought to assert the rights of
the state against such threatened destruction as has been attempted.&quot;</p>
<p>There's an Ojibwe birchbark lodge and a canvas tent with early camping
supplies. There's an exhibit on the 1930s CCC camps, whose crews built
roads, planted trees and stocked fish, and the VCC crew of veterans who
built the stone Forest Inn.</p>
<p>On one wall, an electronic quiz asks visitors what determines the
beginning of the river.</p>
<p>Most, it turns out, agree with Joseph Nicollet, who thought that a river
begins at the farthest point upstream where the first drop of water
flows, rather than with Henry Schoolcraft and Jacob Brower, who thought
it was the farthest point upstream where the flow first constitutes a
river.</p>
<p>In Itasca, there's always room for argument.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Lake Itasca State Park in northern Minnesota</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_douglas_lodge2.jpg" alt="Douglas Lodge in Itasca State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Douglas Lodge has been housing visitors since 1905, when it was
known as "a jewel standing in mud."
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : It's 3½ to 4 hours north of the Twin Cities.</p>
<p><em>Events</em> : Check for lantern-lit ski, snowshoe and hiking evenings,
concerts and other naturalist programs.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : The park is at its best in every season. Hiking is best
in fall, when bugs are down and leaves change color. Look for peak
maple-basswood-birch colors this week and peak oak-aspen colors between
the first and second weeks of October.</p>
<p>It's just as lovely in winter, when pine boughs are draped in snow and
13 miles of trails are groomed for skiing. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/itasca-skiing/">Itasca in
winter</a>.</p>
<p>In spring, orchids and other wildflowers bloom along trails.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.itascasports.com">Sports rental</a> :</strong> By the boat landing, Itasca Sports rents
canoes, kayaks, bikes, paddleboats and pontoon boats, and it sells
fishing tackle, snacks and basic camping goods.</p>
<p><em>Cruises</em> : <a href="https://www.exploreminnesota.com/things-to-do/2149/coborns-lake-itasca-tours-inc">Coborn's Lake Itasca
Tours</a>
are held from Memorial Day weekend through the first week of October.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_headwaters_snowshoeing.jpg" alt="Snowshoeing at Itasca headwaters." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Lauren Gagner</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Itasca is quieter in winter, when visitors can go to the headwaters of
the Mississippi River by snowshoe.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : Except for the <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/lodging/units_rooms.html">Four-Season
Suites</a>, and five Bert's Cabins that stay open for the November deer-hunting
season, park lodgings in the park close in October.</p>
<p><a href="https://reservemn.usedirect.com/MinnesotaWeb/">Lodging
reservations</a>
for park lodgings can be made 120 days in advance at 866-857-2757.</p>
<p><a href="https://reservemn.usedirect.com/MinnesotaWeb/">Campsite
reservations</a>
in Itasca are among the hardest to get, after Split Rock, Temperance
River and Tettegouche state parks. However, some of Itasca's campsites
are designated first-come, first-served.</p>
<p>The best bet in winter are the 12 two-room
<a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/lodging/units_rooms.html">Four-Season Suites</a>, near Douglas Lodge in two buildings that sit on either side of a large
asphalt parking lot.</p>
<p>There's no view, but the suites are attractively furnished and have
cable TV, kitchenettes, WiFi and screened, concrete-floored porches.</p>
<p>The 1905 <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/lodging/units_rooms.html">Douglas
Lodge</a>
has suites and rooms with shared baths. The 1910 Clubhouse has 10
bedrooms. The two-bedroom Historic East Cabin has a fireplace, heat and
air-conditioning.</p>
<p>The very popular Itasca Ozawindib Lake Cabin sleeps up to eight; bring
bedding.</p>
<p>Housekeeping
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/lodging/units_cabins.html">cabins</a>
sleep four and have a toilet but no shower, $103. Cabins of various
sizes come without kitchens, but some have fireplace and screened porch.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_berts_cabins.jpg" alt="Bert's Cabins in Itasca State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bert's Cabins, once part of a private resort, now are rented by the
park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/lodging/units_group.html">Group
lodgings</a>
include the 10-bedroom, six-bath Clubhouse, which sleeps 21 and has a
fireplace and screened porch overlooking Lake Itasca but no kitchen.</p>
<p>The Lake Ozawindib group center of up to 75 includes a large dining
hall, a counselor cabin that sleeps five and a shower building.</p>
<p>A mile from the headwaters, on Wilderness Drive, the park also operates
<a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/lodging/itasca-state-park-berts-cabins.html">Bert's
Cabins</a>, a collection of 12 log housekeeping cabins in a lovely grove of red
pines.</p>
<p>Seven of the cabins are open from Memorial Day weekend through the first
week of October, and five are open from the fishing opener in May
through the second weekend of deer firearms season in November.</p>
<p><em>Dining:</em> Douglas Lodge is a very
pleasant place to have a meal. It's best to stick to basics - the
burgers, the salad bar, the roast pork or turkey dinners.</p>
<p>For lunch, eat in the cafeteria of the Mary Gibbs Mississippi Headwaters
Center, which serves sandwiches, soups and desserts.</p>
