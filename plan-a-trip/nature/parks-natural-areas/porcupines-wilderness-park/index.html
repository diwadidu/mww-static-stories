<h2>On the Upper Peninsula, a splendid wilderness remains unchanged.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porkies_carp_peter_small.jpg" alt="Lake of the Clouds in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Upper Carp River feeds Lake of the Clouds.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Just up north, there's a vast wilderness of lakes, virgin forest and
wild rivers lined by waterfalls and rapids.</p>
<p>It isn't like other north-woods forests — not as they are in this
century, anyway. It's a wilderness unto itself, and though it's no
farther than the state parks farther up Minnesota's North Shore, it
seems a world away.</p>
<p>It feels a world away, too.</p>
<p>This is Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park, on Michigan's Upper
Peninsula, and parts of it look like nowhere else in the region.</p>
<p>Hiking high above Lake of the Clouds, from which the Carp River winds
into the horizon between rolling green ridges, I felt as if I should be
off to find a ring or rescue a princess.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The forest floor, darkened by old-growth hemlocks, also has a fairy-tale
feel — peeping through the windows of a little cottage, I felt like
Goldilocks, wondering if anyone was home — though I'd just passed the
occupants toting their gear back along the trail.</p>
<p>Except for the popular Lake of the Clouds overlook, which nearly can be
reached by car, the Porkies are a place for hikers and backpackers, many
of whom vie for nights in the park's 19 rustic log cabins and four
yurts.</p>
<p>A hundred miles of trails crisscross the 94 square miles of the park,
whose ridges rise 1,000 feet above 23 miles of Lake Superior shoreline.</p>
<p>Under the timber lies the edges of lava that welled out of the Earth a
billion years ago and, as it grew heavier, buckled in the middle to form
the Lake Superior basin. Its edges sloped upward, forming the Porkies,
now worn down and smoothed by erosion and glaciers.</p>
<p>Copper formed in the lava flows, and the first miners arrived thousands
of years ago, leaving pits and stone tools to mark their existence.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porkies_presque_river.jpg" alt="Hiking on the Presque Isle River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the west end of the park, the West River Trail follows the Presque
Isle River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The Ojibwe, who named the area Kaug Wudjoo, place of the crouching
porcupine, arrived not long before French explorers, who noticed copper
nuggets on the rocky shoreline.</p>
<p>Fortune-seekers followed, then mining companies, nearly all of which
were stymied by the rugged topography. The earliest expedition, sent by
London investors in 1771, gave up in disgust on an area Patrick Henry
told Congress was &quot;beyond the most distant wilderness and remote as the
moon.&quot;</p>
<p>Loggers were able to wrest more from the land but got a late start,
after mining companies finally gave up.</p>
<p>The interior of the Porcupines still was untouched when the area was
designated a state park in 1945, and its stand of old-growth forest —
sugar maple, eastern hemlock, yellow birch — is considered the biggest
and best of its kind east of the Mississippi.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the fall, these trees burst into color. In winter, there's skiing —
cross-country and downhill, in a ski area with a vertical drop of 641
feet — on the most copious snowfalls in the Midwest.</p>
<p>In spring, the snowmelt turns the dozens of waterfalls into ferocious
gushers. In summer, people actually can swim from sandy beaches.</p>
<p>Despite all this, the Porkies never have been overrun by tourists. The
U.P. is separated from the rest of Michigan by Lake Michigan, and
Minnesota and Wisconsin have their own wildernesses.</p>
<p>Many visitors, like me, discover the Porkies while taking the Circle
Tour around Lake Superior. And then, like me, they want to return.</p>
<p>One September, my niece and I drove to the Porkies. We hiked first from
the Lake of the Clouds overlook, where the four-mile Escarpment Trail
begins on a worn outcropping of basalt.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porkies_lakecloudsnight_peter_small.jpg" alt="Lake of the Clouds with reflections." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At sunrise, it's easy to see how Lake of the Clouds got its name.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Following the ridge that formed at lava's edge, we were 300 feet above
the valley floor, above hawks coasting atop breezes that made the
treetops below ripple in green waves.</p>
<p>Afterward, we joined retired naturalist Bob Sprague's Black Bear Habitat
hike. Bears are frequently seen in the Porcupines, usually fleetingly.</p>
<p>&quot;They get gone before you even know they're there,&quot; Sprague said.
&quot;You'll have to satisfy yourself with evidence of bears.&quot;</p>
<p>He found it everywhere, showing us a rotten log a bear had ripped apart
looking for grubs; claw marks on a red oak, where a bear was reaching
for acorns; a surprisingly small den; and a clump of hair on the branch
of a small red pine, where a bear had bitten off the top and others had
rubbed, leaving their scents.</p>
<p>He told us what bears eat — berries, ants, fiddlehead ferns — as well as
what they like — bacon, pastries, fried chicken, licorice. Backpackers
who don't hoist their food into a tree have a very good chance of losing
it, he said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porkies_manabezho_falls_peter_small.jpg" alt="Manabezho Falls in the Porkies." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Manabezho Falls is the largest and last drop on the Presque Isle River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;Earlier this summer, I saw a bear off the trail with a big Ziploc bag
of pancake mix,&quot; he said. &quot;The Girl Scouts had failed to put their food
in a tree.&quot;</p>
<p>The next day, we pored over the tantalizing list of hikes. The Union
Spring Trail: &quot;From the floating dock, view over 700 gallons of clear
water bubble out of the ground each minute . . .&quot;</p>
<p>North Mirror Lake Trail: &quot;Surrounded by rugged bluffs and magnificent
pines, at 1,532 feet, it is the highest lake in the park . . . &quot; Of
course, we were dying to hike on the 16-mile Lake Superior Trail, but
just getting to the big lake would take us hours.</p>
<p>So we decided to skip and jump our way across the park. We walked the
milelong loop of the Union Mine Trail, using a guide to identify the
spots where miners had scrabbled for copper alongside the pools and rock
slides of the cold Union River.</p>
<p>Farther west along South Boundary Road, we picked our way along the
Little Carp River Trail, past Overlooked Falls, Greenstone Falls and a
series of rapids.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Under the forest canopy, we'd barely noticed a light drizzle, only how
it made the fallen maple leaves and glossy wood fungus glisten with
color; the entire forest was a wet canvas, brought to life by the
constant hum of rushing water.</p>
<p>At the end of South Boundary Road, we turned toward Lake Superior and
descended to the banks of the Presque Isle River along the West River
Trail, overhung by 350-year-old hemlocks.</p>
<p>The crashing Manabezho, Manido and Nawadaha falls are here, named for
the legendary spirit-warriors of Ojibwe lore.</p>
<p>Everywhere, we saw signs of violence wreaked by water — in the
scallops and potholes drilled into the riverbed by swirling gravel, in
the angry foam whipped up at the river's mouth by the thrusts of Lake
Superior.</p>
<p>Another sign was in black-and-white print: &quot;Beautiful but dangerous . .
. wading or swimming could end your vacation.&quot;</p>
<p>We'd seen plenty in the park, but not enough. The Porcupines, I suspect,
always leaves its visitors wanting more.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park in Michigan</h3>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  It's an hour north of Ironwood, on the
Wisconsin-Michigan border. From U.S. 2 in Wakefield, drive north on
Michigan 28 and 64. The main entrance to the park is near Silver City.</p>
<p>When you get there, you'll be on Eastern Standard Time. The closest town
is Ontonagon, 15 miles east. If you're coming from the west, stock up
on groceries at the Super One on the east side of Ironwood.</p>
<p><em>When to go:</em>  From mid-May through June, flies are a problem. By late
September, frost has killed deer flies, horse flies and the even-worse
stable fly.</p>
<p><em>Winter:</em>  There's downhill skiing, cross-country skiing and some of
the region's best snowshoeing.</p>
