<h2>Love the land? Then help preserve it for the next generation.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/o/gold_rock_point.jpg" alt="View of Gold Rock Point in Lake Superior" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Gold Rock, across from Split Rock Lighthouse on Minnesota's North
Shore, was about to be developed when the Parks & Trails Council bought
it. The non-profit group held it until Minnesota could afford to buy it
and add it to Split Rock Lighthouse State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>As Will Rogers famously said, the trouble with land is they're not
making any more of it.</p>
<p>In the north woods, land previously used by the public for hunting and
hiking and by birds and animals for habitat is disappearing fast. When
it's gone, it's gone, and the public has that much less land to enjoy</p>
<ul>
<li>and around here, we love our open spaces.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Minnesota and Wisconsin, we think we have a lot of public space. But
much of the undeveloped land adjoining state and national forests and
parks is privately owned.</p>
<p>In the north woods, much of it is owned by timber companies, which
historically have allowed public access to lakes and trails. In the
south, much of the land is unused farmland, which has given the public
unobstructed views of scenic bluffs and valleys.</p>
<p>But no view or access is guaranteed. And the same view admired by many
could also be coveted — by one.</p>
<p>When the Parks &amp; Trails Council of Minnesota heard the bluff overlooking
the Whitewater State Park visitors center had been platted for a housing
development, which would give the 300,000 people who visit the park each
year an unobstructed view of siding and shingles, it began talks with
the owners.</p>
<p>Finally, it was able to buy the land, which it held until the DNR raised
the funds to add it to the state park.</p>
<p>The group also prevented the development of Gold Rock Point, the
lichen-covered bluff across from Split Rock Lighthouse, site of the 1905
Madeira shipwreck.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Just like the bluffs along Lake Pepin or the lakes adjoining the
Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, it would have been a spectacular
site for a million-dollar vacation home.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just human nature,&quot; says Wally Abramson, development director
for the Minnesota Land Trust. &quot;Golly, we all want to live there, but
pretty soon, too many of us are there.&quot;</p>
<p>As Abramson says, the people are coming, and they're going to want a
place to live.</p>
<p>But all is not lost — yet. In Minnesota, the nonprofit Parks &amp; Trails
Council and Minnesota Land Trust, along with the Trust for Public Land,
the Nature Conservancy and dozens of regional trusts, are quietly
working to keep the best land open for public enjoyment.</p>
<p>Many states have multiple land trusts and conservancies. Each group
fills a different niche, but all work on the public's behalf.</p>
<p>Considering what they're up against, they are amazingly effective,
working with each other, private landowners, industry and government to
secure easements or to buy and hold threatened land until it can be
purchased by an agency that will protect it.</p>
<p>Typically, the deals involve multiple parties and complex financing,
often taking years to complete.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_bluff.jpg" alt="Hikers in Whitewater State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In southeast Minnesota, developers wanted to build housing on this bluff
overlooking the Whitewater State Park visitors center.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But a nonprofit also can turn on a dime, making purchases much more
quickly than a governmental body could.</p>
<p>In Minnesota's Nicollet County, officials wanted to buy a three-acre
parcel of land that has a 42-foot waterfall as well as a panoramic view
of the Minnesota River Valley.</p>
<p>But when the owner decided to sell, the county didn't have the money.
So, it asked for help from the Trust for Public Land, which negotiated
with the landowner and bought the parcel to lease to Nicollet County
until it could raise funds to buy it.</p>
<p>&quot;Landowners like working with us,&quot; says Trust for Public Land project
manager Bob McGillivray.</p>
<p>&quot;We keep the discussions in confidence, and we may be able to structure
the deal for better tax benefits. We offer one-stop shopping for the
landowner — it can be a bit overwhelming for them, and sometimes
they'd rather deal with just one person.&quot;</p>
<p>All of the groups depend on members, both to provide financial support
and to show policy-makers people are paying attention to land issues.</p>
<p>Here are some of the groups that do a whole lot of good in this region.
You can become a member for as little as $10 — or give a gift
membership to the person who has everything and now wants to give some
of it back.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tpl.org">Trust for Public Land</a> : This national organization
is very active in Minnesota and the north woods of Wisconsin and
Michigan.</p>
<p>It's worked with the National Park Service to add more than 2,500 acres
to the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway and with Grand Marais, Minn.,
to acquire a gas-station site on its harbor shoreline and turn it into a
park.</p>
<p>In northeast Wisconsin, it secured a six-mile easement along the Wolf
River for the Ice Age National Scenic Trail. On Lake Namekagon, near
Cable, it secured the historic Forest Lodge estate, including three
miles of undeveloped shoreline, for eventual use as an environmental
learning center.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.org">The Nature Conservancy</a> : Whereas the Trust for
Public Land buys land to convey to others, the Nature Conservancy often
keeps the land it buys.</p>
<p>The national organization was started in 1951 by a group of college
professors who were using a gorge outside New York City as an outdoor
classroom and one day found it for sale as a housing subdivision.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They mortgaged their homes to buy the property and, with help from the
New York philanthropic community, formed the nonprofit group.</p>
<p>In Minnesota and Wisconsin, the conservancy owns many of the most
beautiful state natural areas, such as the Mink River Estuary in Door
County and Felton Prairie in western Minnesota, where it's especially
active preserving tallgrass prairie.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the DNR, it keeps the areas open for such uses as
hunting, hiking and bird-watching.</p>
<p>In western Minnesota, a 7,000-acre patch of native prairie on which the
Nature Conservancy had been keeping its eye grew fivefold under the
group's stewardship and became Glacial Ridge National Wildlife Refuge,
now operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p>Today, it's a mecca for hunters and bird watchers, as well as
researchers from seven colleges.</p>
<p>Like the Trust for Public Land, the local chapter is working with timber
companies to protect northern Minnesota forests from private
development.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.parksandtrails.org">Parks &amp; Trails Council of Minnesota</a> :
Formed in 1954 by Judge C.R. Magney and other giants of conservation,
this group works with many other organizations and agencies to acquire
land for parks and trails; its first acquisition became Afton State
Park.</p>
<p>Since that auspicious beginning, it has acquired more than 6,500 acres,
preventing development on such crucial parcels as Gold Rock Point,
across from Split Rock Lighthouse and now part of the state park.</p>
<p>It's unique in that its network of 3,000 members is very active around
the state, often identifying important land and lobbying local officials
to protect it.</p>
<p>With help from members and a public/private coalition, it was able to
acquire  the Whitewater Valley bluffland that was on the verge of
becoming a housing development.</p>
<p>It also acquired nearly four miles of land along the Mississippi River
that will allow the Paul Bunyan State Trail to continue south from its
trailhead in Baxter into Crow Wing State Park.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mnland.org">Minnesota Land Trust</a> : This group doesn't buy
land and works primarily with private landowners, though it gives 30 to
40 workshops every year to citizen groups and elected officials around
the state, showing them how to &quot;not rubber-stamp any proposal that
comes down the pike,&quot; says development director Wally Abramson.</p>
<p>&quot;Towns that once were kind of pastoral, scenic and manageable are
receiving an influx of development and saying, 'Whoa, if we don't do
something, it'll disrupt the character of our community,'&quot; he says.</p>
<p>The group helps developers &quot;build more gently on the land&quot; and
counsels private landowners who want to establish conservation easements
on their land, protecting it from development.</p>
<p>Once the easements are in place, the Minnesota Land Trust acts as
steward, checking each year in perpetuity to make sure the easement is
being observed.</p>
<p>Its services are in demand by landowners, many land-rich but cash-poor,
who give up a significant portion of their land's value to preserve it
from development.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of our landowners are just salt-of-the-earth people who love
their land to death and want it to pass on to future generations,&quot;
Abramson said.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Land Trust has established conservation easements in
Bayport, Wayzata and on Lake Pepin, the Rum River and the North Shore.</p>
<p>It also promotes the establishment of buffer areas on private lands
outside such protected areas as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wwlt.org/">Western Wisconsin Land Trust</a> : This trust, based
in Menomonie, preserves agricultural land as well as forest, lakes,
streams and bluff land.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.doorcountylandtrust.org/">Door County Land Trust</a></strong> :
This group has done an excellent job
monitoring development and preserving parcels of land on the popular
Door Peninsula, which has more than two dozen state natural areas.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.inhf.org/">Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation</a> : The group
has helped protect more than 110,000 acres of Iowa's prairies,
wetlands, woodlands, greenways, trails and river corridors.</p>
<p>It's also taken on a big role in building and promoting Iowa's large
system of bicycle trails.</p>
<h3>Other trusts</h3>
<p>Many other non-profit land trusts operate under the umbrella of the
national <a href="http://www.landtrustalliance.org/">Land Trust Alliance</a>,
based in Washington, D.C. It counts more than 1,700 trusts nation-wide.</p>
