<h2>The sandy soil on the Wisconsin River is a springboard for naturalists, past and present.</h2>

<p>In its marshes and woods, John Muir first discovered the joys of
wilderness. On its sandy plains, Aldo Leopold became a pioneer of land
stewardship. On its meadows, two young ornithologists created a haven
for cranes.</p>
<p>The natural world found some of its greatest allies on a swath of
rolling, glaciated land in south-central Wisconsin. Muir went on to
found the Sierra Club and is known as a father of America's national
parks.</p>
<p>Leopold inspired legions with such books as &quot;A Sand County Almanac.&quot;
George Archibald and Ron Sauey founded the International Crane
Foundation.</p>
<p>Wisconsin often is called the cradle of conservation.</p>
<p>It was the first state to ban the use of DDT, before it was banned
nationally in 1972,  largely thanks to Lorrie Otto of suburban
Milwaukee, who put native plants in her front yard in the 1950s and
became known as the godmother of natural landscaping.</p>
<p>Earth Day was founded in 1970 by yet another Wisconsinite, former Sen.
Gaylord Nelson.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The epicenter of conservation is the Baraboo Hills, whose 800-ton
boulders, grotto-like glens and quartzite cliffs make geologists
hyperventilate.</p>
<p>The same glacier responsible for this dramatic landscape also helped
create an ecological crossroads that the Nature Conservancy has declared
a &quot;Last Great Place&quot; for its highly concentrated 1,800 species of
plants and animals.</p>
<p>The Ice Age National Scenic Trail winds through its heart, and other
paths take hikers into its quiet nooks and crannies, only a few miles
from blaring Wisconsin Dells.</p>
<p>Its terrain is most enchanting in spring, when chartreuse-tinted
sunlight filters through the woodland canopy, songbirds return to the
bushes and wildflowers bloom along forest paths.</p>
<h3>Traces of the Ice Age</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/a/parfreys_glen3.jpg" alt="Parfrey's Glen in Wisconsin." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Parfrey's Glen was Wisconsin's first state natural area.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>One May, my friend Pat and I made a pilgrimage to this land of
naturalists. We started at Parfrey's Glen, the state's oldest natural
area, following a stream through a narrow, otherworldly gorge.</p>
<p>Its moss-covered rock walls were embedded with plum-puddingstone, globes
of quartzite; where they'd fallen out, the sandstone resembled a
beehive.</p>
<p>A boardwalk led to the gorge's end, where a curtain of water fell from a
creek flowing at the feet of popples, high overhead.</p>
<p>The air was heavy with the rich smell of humus, and the forest floor was
covered with May apple, wood phlox, columbine and jack-in-the-pulpit;
monkshood and orchid also thrive here, where cold air pools at the
bottom of a glacial slope.</p>
<p>Devil's Lake, Wisconsin's most-visited state park, lies just to the
west, with 500-foot cliffs surrounding the spring-fed lake.
Rock-climbers and hikers love its glassy-smooth, pink-quartzite cliffs,
once sand at the edge of a red ocean.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>That was 2 billion years ago; it was only 13,000 years ago when the last
glacier dumped fields of boulders in the park, each as heavy as 400 cars
(for more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake-geology/">High drama at Devil's Lake</a>).</p>
<h3>Endangered cranes</h3>
<p>From Devil's Lake, we drove north through Baraboo to the grounds of the
International Crane Foundation. Founded in 1973 on the horse farm of Ron
Sauey's parents, the center harbors all 15 of the world's crane species.</p>
<p>As we approached a red-eyed sarus crane, the tallest flying bird in the
world at 6 feet, he threw his saber-like beak into the air and emitted a
shriek that made us jump nearly out of our shoes.</p>
<p>Cranes use their voices to alert others to trespassers, our
tape-recorded guide told us, and what voices they have — more like an
elephant's bugle than a bird's trill.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baraboo_blue_crane.jpg" alt="A blue crane at the Crane Foundation." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The blue crane is one of the 19 species at the International Crane
Foundation.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Cranes, wrote Aldo Leopold, are &quot;wildness incarnate.&quot; These live and
breed in Baraboo because their habitats are shrinking around the world,
despite their revered status in Uganda and Australia, Japan and Bhutan.</p>
<p>We walked by a red-crowned Asian crane who looked up from its grooming
to growl at us, and a South African blue crane who stalked toward us
with his neck feathers flared like a cobra — threat behavior, used by
both males and females.</p>
<p>For birds, cranes have awfully big personalities. A sarus crane named
Wolf, the recording informed us, once was so aggressive he was separated
from his mate, with whom he normally would share incubating duties.</p>
<p>He was so frustrated he built his own nest, in which he incubated two
stones the size of crane's eggs.</p>
<p>We went on to the whooping crane exhibit, which has its own marsh and
tells the remarkable story of the first ultralight-guided migration of
Wisconsin cranes to Florida in 2001.</p>
<p>Then we left the cranes to walk the center's serene nature trails,
stopping to examine clusters of pink prairie smoke, white shooting stars
and newly unfurled maple leaves, pink and velvety as the nape of a
baby's neck.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_maple_leaves.jpg" alt="Baby maple leaves unfurl in early spring." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Warblers zoomed across the paths, and two red-winged blackbirds chased
us out of their domain. Behind us, we heard a shrill cacophony — the
cranes, reacting to a newly arrived group of schoolchildren.</p>
<h3>A famous shack</h3>
<p>From the Crane Foundation, it's only seven miles to Aldo Leopold's
shack, the only chicken coop on the National Register of Historic
Places.</p>
<p>A professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Leopold spent
weekends at the tiny shack, on a plain along the Wisconsin River that
was to Leopold what Walden Pond was to Thoreau.</p>
<p>&quot;On this sand farm in Wisconsin, first worn out and then abandoned by
our bigger-and-better society, we try to rebuild, with shovel and axe,
what we are losing elsewhere,&quot; Leopold wrote in the 1948 foreword to &quot;A
Sand County Almanac.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, the shack is part of a preserve that includes the new Aldo
Leopold Legacy Center. When we got there, a school group from
Rhinelander was busy pulling out garlic mustard.</p>
<p>Even today, the farm is no paradise. Scrub maples struggle on the sand
plain, and poison ivy joins lupine and puccoon in the meadow. The
handsome pines that line the path to a slough — breeding ground for
the many mosquitoes — aren't authentic to the area, but Leopold loved
them.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baraboo_shack.jpg" alt="Aldo Leopold's shack." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Aldo Leopold's shack is the only chicken coop on the National Register
of Historic Places.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Leopold, who died in 1948 while fighting a grass fire on a neighbor's
land, had a vision for this unlovely land.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like a baby,&quot; said staffer Rob Nelson. &quot;Why do we love a baby
when it's born? Because of the potential it has.&quot;</p>
<h3>Apostle for the wilderness</h3>
<p>Half an hour to the east, a teen-age John Muir was working 12-hour days,
helping his tyrannical father carve a farm out of wilderness. His only
solace came from the flora and fauna, especially the songbirds and
sandhill cranes.</p>
<p>&quot;This sudden plash into pure wildness — baptism in Nature's warm heart
— how utterly happy it made us!&quot; he recalled. &quot;Nature streaming into
us, wooingly teaching her wonderful flowing lessons . . . Oh, that
glorious Wisconsin wilderness!&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Today, the family farmstead, north of Portage, is John Muir Memorial
County Park.</p>
<p>We followed the trail around Ennis Lake, a marshy kettle lake where Muir
and his brothers fished and swam amid the cattails and water lilies, and
along the foot of a hill, where he gathered hickory nuts on Sunday
afternoons, his only time off.</p>
<p>In only eight years the sandy land was played out, due to Daniel Muir's
wasteful farming practices, and young John was put to work on a new
claim. Today, the farmstead has returned to its wild state.</p>
<p>As we walked along, listening to the call of birds and stopping to
admire the delicate colors of hickory buds, a deer came thundering out
of the rushes and bounded away at full throttle.</p>
<p>For John Muir and Aldo Leopold, misuse of this land made them see the
world in a new way.</p>
<p>Their legacy lives on in the Baraboo Hills, where modern-day
preservationists also are hard at work. Thanks to them, spring hikers
will find a landscape full of wonder.</p>
