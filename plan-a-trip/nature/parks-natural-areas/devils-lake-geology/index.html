<p>We're at the end of the Ice Age, at the edge of an endless mound of blue
ice whose vast, super-cold surface has sent 200-mph winds whipping into
Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The winds can strip the flesh off a face in 30 seconds, so the local
mammoth hunters have gone south for the winter.</p>
<p>Now the hunters are back, standing at the edge of a milky-white,
70-mile-long lake made by melting ice.</p>
<p>There are 500-pound beavers here, too, and 8-ton bison. The hunters run
up to a woolly mammoth, sink an 8-inch spear tip into its neck and dash
away.</p>
<p>As they wait for the animal to bleed to death, they hear a rumble, then
a roar, as the earth begins to shake. A 100-foot wall of water descends
on the valley, cutting through ancient sandstone like a knife through
butter.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the landscape has some features we can recognize — the
canyons of the Wisconsin Dells, for one.</p>

<p>Ancient history? No, it's high drama, especially when told by Paul Herr,
the P.T. Barnum of Wisconsin geology.</p>
<p>&quot;Geologists from all over the world come to see this, and their jaws
drop,&quot; says Herr, a Madison geologist. &quot;They say, 'I thought I was
going to see dairy cows, not one of the most stunning natural
attractions on the planet.' &quot;</p>
<p>He levels a stern gaze at his tour guests, gathered under a red pine
near the entrance to Devil's Lake State Park.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad you found me,&quot; he says, &quot;because I'd have to arrest you at
the border if you didn't stop to see Devil's Lake.&quot;</p>
<p>Devil's Lake, besides being the most-visited state park in Wisconsin, is
the centerpiece of the Baraboo Hills, a 25-mile-long swatch of
south-central Wisconsin that has been recognized as a &quot;Last Great
Place&quot; by the Nature Conservancy.</p>

<p>Its pink quartzite ridges were at the edge of a continent 2 billion
years ago, when Wisconsin was covered by volcanoes. Its peaks were
tropical islands 500 million years ago.</p>
<p>And 13,000 years ago, it was at the edge of a glacier that dumped piles
of 800-ton boulders and, when it melted, created Devil's Lake, one of
the clearest lakes in Wisconsin and, many think, the most beautiful.</p>
<p>This glacier stretched from New York state to Puget Sound and deep into
Canada. But it was called the Wisconsin Glacier, because it tells its
story best in the Baraboo Hills.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just happenstance that so much happens to be in such a small
area,&quot; Herr says. &quot;Geology doesn't get any better than this.&quot;</p>
<p>It takes a real showman to promote geology in a neighborhood that
includes the water parks of Wisconsin Dells and the acrobats and clowns
of Circus World Museum in Baraboo.</p>
<p>And who could make a kid want a souvenir trilobite fossil as much as a
plastic pirate sword? Only Paul Herr, the ringmaster of rocks.</p>
<p>One day, I and six other people piled into Herr's van for a trip back in
time. We drove up a gravel-filled ridge that marks the southernmost
advance of a 4,000-mile-long glacier.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the front yard of a stable, we look at a horizon filled by blue
glacial ice, and we can hear boulders, carried down from Canada,
tumbling off the ice as it scrapes a path northward.</p>
<p>Then we see a giant lake, and we hear a deafening whoosh as an ice dam
gives way and sends a wall of water into the valley, creating the
Wisconsin Dells in a week.</p>
<p>&quot;Should we say thank you to the glacier before we leave?&quot; Herr asks.
&quot;Thanks for making wonderful fishing in the Midwest, and our wonderful
lakes in the northwoods. Thanks for making us the breadbasket of the
nation; we had very crummy soil, and the glacier spread freshly ground
rock and made it very fertile.</p>
<p>&quot;And thanks for making humans; the climatic changes forced people to
adapt and promoted development of the large-brained primate.&quot;</p>

Balanced Rock.

<p>At the entrance to Devil's Lake State Park, we stopped to look at a
towering mound of pink quartzite. It's part of a mile-thick sheet of
super-hard quartzite that, 1½ billion years ago, folded up like paper
when the edge of another continent collided with it.</p>
<p>Now its edges rise out of the ground around the park, providing the
picturesque, 500-foot cliffs around spring-fed Devil's Lake.</p>
<p>Herr uses a laser point to show us the ripples on the rock, formed 2
billion years ago, when it was still sand at the edge of a red ocean
filled with iron-eating bacteria.</p>
<p>&quot;We geologists get light-headed when we touch it,&quot; Herr said. &quot;It's
so ancient, like a relic from the past.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, these glassy cliffs are treasured by rock climbers: &quot;They say if
you can climb Baraboo quartzite, you can climb anything,&quot; Herr said.</p>
<p>We went into the park, past the gorgeous sand beach and one of nine
Indian burial mounds. The Winnebago, who could hear echoes bouncing off
the cliffs, thought there was an evil spirit in the lake, so European
explorers named it Devil's Lake.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_lake_tumbled_rocks2.jpg" alt="Tumbled Rocks Trail at Devil's Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Hikers walk the Tumbled Rocks Trail through 800-ton quartzite boulders.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Turkey vultures soared above us as we walked to a pile of quartzite
boulders, each as heavy as 400 cars, and each looking exactly as it did
13,000 years ago, when they tumbled off the cliff.</p>
<p>Hiking on the East Bluff Trail, we stopped at the entrance to a narrow
cave, and Herr showed us round dings on the quartzite, percussion marks
made when the Baraboo Hills were islands and 50-foot waves smacked the
boulders against one another.</p>
<p>Then we admired the view of an area Herr calls the Grand Canyon of the
Midwest.</p>
<p>Herr says he's happy if only 5 percent of the area's tourists are open
to receiving what he calls &quot;the gift of the big picture.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One of my goals is to stretch the brain a little bit, to get people to
see the big picture,&quot; he says. &quot;Everyone should know the story of our
planet, and life on our planet. And this is one of the best places in
the world to learn your own story.&quot;</p>
