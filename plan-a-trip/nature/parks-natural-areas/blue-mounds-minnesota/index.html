<h2>At Minnesota's Blue Mounds, the shifting beauty of the prairie has a showcase.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/l/blue_mounds_cliffs.jpg" alt="Quartzite cliffs at Blue Mounds State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Quartzite cliffs erupt out of prairie at Blue Mounds.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the land of 10,000 lakes, prairie often is dismissed as, well, dull.</p>
<p>But in the farthest corner of Minnesota, a dramatic patch of terrain
offers more spectacle than an Imax show.</p>
<p>I stood atop Blue Mounds one afternoon in June, watching as bolts of
lightening rocketed earthward from a leaden, wraparound sky.</p>
<p>At my feet, domes of blood-red rock erupted out of pale grass; nearby,
piles of boulders squatted at the edge of a 90-foot cliff, but there was
no shelter for anything bigger than a squirrel.</p>
<p>This 1½-mile-long cliff line, erupting out of the southwest Minnesota
prairie like a mirage — it was called Blue Mounds by early settlers,
who first glimpsed it in the far-off haze — is home to one of the
last bits of prairie left in Minnesota, and it's not dull.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In early summer, the filmy pink strands of prairie smoke wave in the
breeze, then give way to the yellow blooms of prickly pear cactus and
then to a sea of big bluestem and Indian grass.</p>
<p>Hawks wheel overhead, and a herd of more than 100 bison graze behind
wire fence.</p>
<p>These all have parts in the drama, but the scenes often are stolen by
the looming sky and by wind, which rarely stops.</p>
<p>This Prairie Coteau, known locally as Buffalo Ridge, is the uplifted
floor of an ancient sea, its red sand cooked and pressed into hard,
almost marble-like quartzite.</p>
<p>During the last Ice Age, its immovable mass split the advancing glacier,
which dumped debris on its flanks and formed a high plateau that juts
into northwest Iowa on one edge and North Dakota on the other.</p>
<p>It rises to more than 750 feet above the surrounding plain, and the
steady winds that blow over its top now turn turbines on wind towers
that feed electricity to the Twin Cities.</p>

<p>Its outcroppings of 1.5 billion-year-old rock also appear at the sacred
quarries of Pipestone, 20 miles north, and at Jeffers Petroglyphs to the
east, near Sanborn. At Blue Mounds, the cliff line and surrounding
terrain, too rocky to plow, are preserved as Blue Mounds State Park.</p>
<p>When it became a state park, in 1961, three bison were brought in from
Nebraska. The park's herd has flourished and can be observed from
platforms near the park's north entrance and from Mound Trail, which
follows the fence of their summer pasture.</p>
<p>There's a beach on Lower Mound Lake — a creek impoundment; Rock
County is the only county in Minnesota that does not have a natural
lake — and hiking on 13 miles of trails.</p>
<p>The Lower Cliffline Trail leads along the curving cliff, used by
thousands of rock climbers every year.</p>
<p>Between the Upper Cliffline and Upper Mound trails, a 1,250-foot line of
rocks aligns the rising and setting sun on the first day of spring and
the first day of fall; no one knows why.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Author Frederick Manfred lived amid this mystery and drama for decades
and made it the setting for his books, calling it &quot;Siouxland.&quot;</p>
<p>His home, a quartzite aerie with a six-sided writing tower he called a
&quot;tipi,&quot; now is the park's interpretive center.</p>
<p>Every day, Manfred looked out on the changing prairie landscape. It's a
tableau best seen early in the morning, when wildflowers emerge from
haze and the cliffs gleam red in the morning sun, or late, when the
slow-moving bison are silhouetted against the horizon.</p>
<p>These also are the best times to hear the calls of grassland birds —
meadowlarks, nighthawks, sparrows.</p>
<p>National Geographic photographer Jim Brandenburg, who grew up six miles
to the south in Luverne, also was inspired by this landscape.</p>

In summer, blazing star and Queen Anne's lace bloom on the prairie.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In 1999, he opened the Brandenburg Gallery downtown, and profits go
toward prairie education and preservation.</p>
<p>On the walls hang many images of Blue Mounds, so beautiful it's as if
God arranged all the elements just for him — lightning bolts snaking
toward Earth, Indian grass glowing in the fierce orange of the setting
sun, clouds sitting plump and rosy in endless sky.</p>
<p>The Lakota and other Plains Indians also were inspired by this &quot;empty&quot;
prairie. To them, it was God's canvas, the spiritual backdrop for their
culture.</p>
<p>&quot;We did not think of the great open plains, the beautiful rolling
hills, and winding streams with tangled growth, as wild,&quot; said Lakota
chief Luther Standing Bear.</p>
<p>&quot;Only to the white man was nature a wilderness, and only to him was the
land infested with wild animals and savage people. To us, it was tame.
Earth was bountiful, and we were surrounded with the blessing of the
Great Mystery.&quot;</p>
