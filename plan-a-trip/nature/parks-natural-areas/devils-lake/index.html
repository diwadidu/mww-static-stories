<h2>In Wisconsin's Baraboo Hills, a stunning state park makes people come running.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_lake_sumac.jpg" alt="Devil's Lake State Park in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Rocky bluffs surround Devil's Lake, one of the clearest in Wisconsin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Wisconsin, a bunch of rocks sets hearts aflutter.</p>
<p>They enchant geologists, of course, but also scuba divers, rock climbers
and botanists. The rest of us, too — hikers, birders, campers, Boy
Scouts.</p>
<p>We all go to give Devil's Lake its due.</p>
<p>Just south of the Wisconsin Dells, Devil's Lake State Park draws more than 3
million people a year, four times as many as Minnesota's
most-visited state park, Gooseberry Falls.</p>
<p>Its lake is one of the clearest. Its glassy-smooth quartzite cliffs are
the most challenging to climb. Its flora is among the rarest. And its
rocks tell a story that's as clearly drawn as a first-grade primer.</p>
<p>It's all there, in 500-foot bluffs that crumpled 1½ billion years ago
in a collision of continents. It's in pockmarks that show where 50-foot
waves smacked rock against rock 500 million years ago.</p>
<p>Volcanoes, tropical oceans and glaciers all left visible mementos of
their stays.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Spectacular as the geological story is, the fall leaves stole the show
one October, when I visited with friends. We'd driven only a few feet
into the park before we had to get out and gaze, awestruck, at a canopy
of golden sugar maples that made the air shimmer with light.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like in the 'Wizard of Oz,' where Dorothy wakes up and sees
the Emerald City, and suddenly everything is in color,&quot; said my friend
Mary.</p>
<p>It was the third weekend of October, late for such a vivid display of
fall color, but this part of Wisconsin follows its own rules.</p>
<p>The surrounding Baraboo Hills are an ecological crossroads that was one
of the first &quot;Last Great Places&quot; named by the Nature Conservancy.</p>
<p>From its 30-mile-long flanks radiate the coulees of the Driftless Area,
the central sand plains and the lumpy rubble left by the Wisconsin
Glacier, which covered two-thirds of North America but was named for
Wisconsin because that's where its path can be traced best.</p>
<p>Once we got past the entrance, we drove down to Devil's Lake. Its name
is thought to be either a reference to its otherworldly rock formations
or a mistranslation of the original Ho-Chunk name or a clever bid to
attract tourists.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_lake_hiker.jpg" alt="Hiking in Devil's Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Bluff Trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was a resort area until 1904, with guests arriving on a rail line
that still hugs the east shore.</p>
<p>The state park was established only seven years later, but three private
cottages still occupy a corner of the west shore.</p>
<p>With a trail map in hand, we set off on the West Bluff Trail, also part
of the Ice Age National Scenic Trail. It took us high above the lake,
where we stood on flat slabs of slick pink quartzite admiring the view
over clumps of cedar, juniper and sumac.</p>
<p>On many of the slabs, we could see ripple marks left by waves 2 billion
years ago, when the quartzite was sand at the edge of an iron-rich
ocean.</p>
<p>&quot;Ooh, I can feel it,&quot; said my friend Val, laying her hands on the wavy
ripples. &quot;I'm trying to suppress that Julie Andrews 'The Hills Are
Alive' thing.&quot;</p>
<p>It's easy to see why the Ho-Chunk and early European visitors might
have thought supernatural forces were at work here.</p>
<p>Many of the cliffs look as carefully built as a retaining wall; on the
other bluff, such formations as Balanced Rock and the Devil's Doorway
look like nothing made by nature.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At one overlook, an exhibit explained an ancient river cut the canyon
below but was plugged by debris carried by the last glacier, causing the
rise of a spring-fed lake. The former riverway still can be seen
plainly, stretching into the horizon.</p>
<p>Down at the lake, we walked back along the Tumbled Rocks Trail, which
dodged between hundreds of gigantic quartzite blocks that frost had
split from the bluffs.</p>
<p>&quot;This has just been eye candy,&quot; Val said when we got back.</p>
<h3>Mementos of the Ice Age</h3>
<p>The next day, we split into two groups so we could hike the 10 miles
between Devil's Lake and Parfrey's Glen.</p>
<p>My group started on the East Bluff Trail, from which we could see the
Baraboo Hills undulating to the north; as we looked, the sun came out
and made all the yellows pop out of the treetop quilt of colors.</p>
<p>Across the lake, the field of 800-ton boulders we'd walked through the
previous day looked like a slope of scree.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/a/parfreys_glen7.jpg" alt="Parfrey's Glen in Wisconsin." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Parfrey's Glen was Wisconsin's first state natural area.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Soon, we came to Balanced Rock, plunked on the edge of a cliff, and the
Devil's Doorway, with an arch that seemed a little haphazard.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks as if a kid put it together,&quot; Cathy said.</p>
<p>Then, we squeezed along narrow paths, picking our way carefully from
slab to slab. &quot;I feel like a Grand Canyon mule,&quot; Jane said.</p>
<p>We descended to an oak forest, but soon our path led us back up the rock
bluff. By the time we'd scrambled our way up to the junction with the
Ice Age National Scenic Trail, our knees had turned to jelly.</p>
<p>The 1,000-mile trail, which follows the farthest advance of the last
glacier through Wisconsin, makes a big loop around Devil's Lake,
forming two east-west segments.</p>
<p>From the southern stretch we used the state park's Upland Trail to
connect with the northern stretch; just west of County Road 113, we met
the other group and, after exchanging car keys, sat down for a picnic.</p>
<p>After lunch, my group continued eastward through a corridor of red and
yellow maples and into meadows lined with scarlet sumac. It was easy
walking, and soon we reached Parfrey's Glen, the state's oldest
natural area.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_lake_rocks2.jpg" alt="Rocks in Devil's Lake State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the East Bluff Trail, hikers walk past the Devil's Doorway and
Balanced Rock.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From the parking lot, a path followed a trickling stream into a narrow
slit in the Earth. Its walls were plum-puddingstone, globes of quartzite
embedded in sandstone; at the back of the gorge, a lacy waterfall fell
from a creek overhead.</p>
<p>Parfrey's Glen is the best known of the state's natural areas and one
of the easiest to visit.</p>
<p>But the Baraboo Hills are sprinkled with these areas as well as Nature
Conservancy preserves. The nonprofit group has been working to protect
the range for more than 30 years and now owns nearly 8,000 acres at 12
preserves, which it keeps open to the public for low-impact recreation.</p>
<p>For some reason, their names have a hillbilly quality — Baxter's
Hollow, Hemlock Draw, Pewits Nest.</p>
<p>The next day, we headed for Pewits Nest, a state-owned creek gorge that
was named for &quot;an individual who lived in the solid sandstone, like a
gnome in a cavern . . . this dwelling resembled the nest of a phoebe (or
peewit, an earlier name for this bird), hence dubbed by early settlers
the 'Peewit's Nest.'&quot;</p>
<p>It's surrounded by farm fields, but once we got there, we were in
another world. From the top of the gorge, shaded by a canopy of cedar,
pine, hemlock and birch, we followed a trail to a black pool whose
surface was completely coated by a colorful mosaic of fallen leaves.</p>
<p>It was fed by a small waterfall, and we could see more whitewater
farther down Skillet Creek, running between the moist, terraced walls of
the gorge.</p>

<h3>Nearby attractions</h3>
<p>That appealing little pocket whetted our appetite for discovery, so we
drove down U.S. 12 to the Land of Evermor, where salvager Tom Every
turned spare parts into whimsical folk art, most famously the
Forevertron, a time and intergalactic travel contraption that may be
the world's largest scrap-metal sculpture.</p>
<p>In their own way, the recycled pieces were as beautiful as Pewits Nest,
and Every, who died in 2020, considered himself as much a conservator as
the folks at the DNR and Nature Conservancy.</p>
<p>&quot;We're only here a short time,&quot; said Every, who started building his
art park in 1983. &quot;We've got to leave this planet something. We've
got to leave it a little better than we found it.&quot;</p>
<p>In the Baraboo Hills, people preserve things. At the Mid-Continent
Railway Museum in nearby North Freedom, you can ride on restored coaches
behind old locomotives.</p>
<p>At Circus World Museum in Baraboo, you can see the world's largest
collection of circus wagons at the old Ringlingville.</p>

Trail to Parfrey's Glen.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>And at the International Crane Foundation, you can see birds that nearly
went extinct.</p>
<p>The crane haven was our last stop. It harbors all 15 of the world's
crane species, because crane habitat is shrinking all over the world.</p>
<p>Its whooping cranes have their own marsh and exhibit, which tells how
young Wisconsin cranes were taught to follow an ultralight to Florida in
2001, re-establishing the traditional winter migration and helping to
build the flock.</p>
<p>In this part of the world, preservation has paid off for everybody.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/devilslake/">Devil's Lake State Park</a> and Baraboo Hills</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> It's 45 minutes north of Madison, just south of
Wisconsin Dells off U.S. 12. The park is three miles south of Baraboo.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.devilslakewisconsin.com/devils-lake-information-guide/park-stickers-fees/"><strong>Admission</strong></a>: A daily vehicle permit is $13 for residents, $16 for non-residents,
higher than other Wisconsin state parks. Devil's Lake also accepts
national park passes.</p>
<p>People who also buy a daily permit at nearby Mirror Lake can visit both
parks for the Mirror Lake rate of $8/$11.</p>
<p><em>Hiking:</em> There are 30 miles of hikes of all lengths and difficulties in
Devil's Lake State Park. On the west side of Devil's Lake, the paved
Tumbled Rocks Trail is only a mile and follows the shoreline.</p>
<p>Atop the bluffs on the east side of the lake, the East Bluff Trail also
is a mile. Both trails connect to the Ice Age National Scenic Trail.</p>
<p>A hike around Devil's Lake, including a loop around the Devil's
Doorway and Balanced Rock formations on the southeast side of the lake,
is about five miles.</p>
<p>To make a great 10-mile one-way hike, walk from the visitor center on
the north shore (pick up a trail map) to the East Bluff Trail and follow
it to the Balanced Rocks Trail. From it, take the Grottoes Trail mile to
the CCC Trail.</p>
<p>At the top, look for a narrow path; it leads to the southern segment of
Ice Age National Scenic Trail.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baraboo_pewits_nest.jpg" alt="Pewits Nest SNA near Baraboo." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Baraboo, Pewits Nest is a narrow gorge amid farmland.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Head east, following the yellow blazes, then take the Uplands Trail to
the northern segment of the Ice Age Trail, which soon crosses County
Road 113 as it heads east to Parfrey's Glen; it's another 1½ miles to
the end of the canyon and back. Expect to spend at least 5½ hours.</p>
