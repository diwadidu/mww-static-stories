<h2>There's a lot of scenery crammed into one stretch of Lake Superior around Munising.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pictured_rocks_boat.jpg" alt="A cruise boat along Pictured Rocks." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A cruise boat takes sightseers to the cliffs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Along Michigan's Pictured Rocks, there's no such thing as a bad view.</p>
<p>White sandstone cliffs line nearly 40 miles of national lakeshore, the
nation's first when it was created in 1966. Named for the colorful
swishes and whorls painted by mineral-laden water oozing through cracks,
Pictured Rocks draws tourists from around the world.</p>
<p>This part of Michigan is inconveniently distant for tourists from big
cities: Detroit is closer to Charleston, W.V., than Munising.</p>
<p>But it may be just distant enough. Munising, 45 minutes east of
Marquette, is an unremarkable town, but it sits in a remarkable setting
that would be mobbed if it were any closer.</p>
<p>At the foot of a protected bay, it's surrounded by waterfalls, sand
beaches and lighthouses.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Grand Island is just opposite, a national recreation area that once held
a game preserve and hotel but now is the preserve of campers, hikers and
mountain bikers. Shipwrecks lie along its shores in the Alger Underwater
Preserve.</p>
<p>The best swimming beach is east of town, a pine-lined crescent just
beyond Munising Falls, a delicate cascade that floats 50 feet into a
narrow forest bowl.</p>
<p>On the south side of town, Wagner Falls is more robust, bumping over
stone terraces before a sheer drop. Its cedar-lined banks served as a
girlfriends getaway for a young woman named Tillie Wagner, who
homesteaded the site in 1895 and vacationed there with friends.</p>
<p>In town, the glass-bottom boat shipwreck tour is nearly as popular as
the sightseeing boats. Divers have the best view of the many wrecks, but
thanks to an underwater cliff that rises in some places to within 5 feet
of the surface, so do people in boats.</p>
<p>When I went on the tour, we could clearly see the remains of the wooden
schooner Bermuda, which sank in 1870 with three sleeping crewmen and a
load of iron ore.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pictured_rocks_cliff_backpackers.jpg" alt="Backpackers stand on a cliff at Pictured Rocks." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;We should all last as long as this boat without turning green,&quot;
said Pepper, our narrator, who credited Lake Superior's low
temperatures and high alkaline content. &quot;A lot of people liken it to a
pirate ship, and it's hard not to make that comparison. Pretty cool,
huh?&quot;</p>
<p>Heading toward the open lake, we passed Grand Island's East Channel
Lighthouse, a weathered gray wooden light built in 1867.</p>
<p>Then we spied the sandstone cliffs of Pictured Rocks, bulging outward
like the sides of a whaleback steamer, stained red by rust.</p>
<p>Through the hull of our boat we saw a real steamer, the 1890 Herman
Hettler, which sank with its load of salt in a November 1926 squall.
Sailing with only a compass in zero visibility, it rammed onto the rock
reef and was abandoned.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Coast Guard had to dynamite the remains, which include
such recognizable items as a smokestack, bathtub and commode.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The third wreck we saw was a wooden scow schooner, sturdily constructed
with 3 1/2-foot nails but no bow or stern, a poor design for Lake
Superior's short, choppy waves, Pepper said.</p>
<p>It would have been built before 1840, perhaps by a French-Canadian
trapper, and now it lies in only 8 feet of water.</p>
<p>&quot;It remains a mystery ship for us,&quot; Pepper said.</p>
<h3>Exploring the lakeshore</h3>
<p>Most people see the famous cliffs from excursion boats that leave the
town of Munising hourly in peak season. That's what I did the first
time I was there, and while I was glad to get the cruise-boat view of
the cliffs, I could see that kayakers could get a lot closer.</p>
<p>So the next time, I made a reservation for a kayak tour. But the
outfitter lost it, and my husband and I had to move to Plan B. That
meant seeing the cliffs from the top, while hiking on a 42-mile section
of the North Country National Scenic Trail.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/u/munising_grand_light.jpg" alt="Roadside Distractions." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 1868 Grand Island East Channel Light, which tour boats pass on their
way to Pictured Rocks, is a rare wooden lighthouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was one of the luckiest setbacks we've ever had. We were only on top
of the Upper Peninsula, but we felt on top of the world.</p>
<p>To get to the trailhead, we drove east of Munising, turning off the
paved county road onto a narrow gravel track that lay under a canopy of
trees.</p>
<p>Pictured Rocks isn't Yellowstone; roads run just far enough into the
national park to deposit hikers, and most of them aren't paved.</p>
<p>At the end of Chapel Road, we parked and headed into the forest. We saw
no people, but the croaks of bullfrogs filled the air around a bog
covered by a blanket of brilliant green.</p>
<p>Chipmunks lurked everywhere, chirping in surround sound, and a flock of
grouse whirred out of our path one by one, taking off like a fleet of
miniature helicopters.</p>
<p>We took the long way past Mosquito Falls, really two sets of rapids and
falls along the Mosquito River, tucked amid rock outcroppings.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pictured_rocks_swimming.jpg" alt="Swimming at Pictured Rocks." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Boys swim at the base of the cliffs near Mosquito Falls.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From there, the path led us to the big lake, where we emerged just as
the 11 a.m. cruise boat was chugging past. The passengers crowding its
decks looked like matchsticks, and we were glad we were literally
cooling our heels on land.</p>
<p>Only an inch of water coursed over the rock ledges at the river's
mouth, and we splashed along through a whole gallery of cobblestone
cairns artfully arranged by some forest sprite.</p>
<p>On the other side of the river, cliffs gradually slid into the water,
and I walked over the crumbly gray shingles to a pontoon boat that had
tied up.</p>
<p>It hadn't occurred to me to rent a boat, but I could see it would be a
good idea.</p>
<p>&quot;This is perfect,&quot; said Michele Goodrich of Ortonville, Mich., who
had rented the pontoon for the day with her husband and his parents.</p>
<p>&quot;We've done the excursion boats, but this way we can stop and get out
and explore the rocks. There will be three of those boats going by and
you're just getting started; they really race 'em through.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pictured_rocks_bay.jpg" alt="The mouth of the Mosquito River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A pontoon anchors near the mouth of the Mosquito River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We made a wrong turn at the Mosquito group campsite and spent 15 minutes
back in the forest, where we ran into a pack of teen-age boys in swim
trunks going the other way.</p>
<p>We hadn't realized how closely the path hugs the clifftop, and once we
were back on track, the postcard views never stopped.</p>
<p>There was a spectacular view around every corner: the wide arch at Grand
Portal Point, the jutting face of Indian Head, the 200-foot cliff faces
splashed with pale yellow, green, brown, white and red.</p>
<p>&quot;It really is as if someone poured paint down the sides,&quot; my husband
said.</p>
<p>Each vista was framed by turquoise water. Boulder fields lie under the
surface, though from our perch on the cliffs, they looked like white
gumballs. We spotted the teen boys below, running along the edge of the
water and around the cliffs.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We got our chance to cool off at Chapel Beach, the western end of
Twelvemile Beach.</p>
<p>By then, we'd hiked seven miles, and we were hot. From a rustic
campground in a pine grove, we ran down sand-covered steps into Lake
Superior, whose temperature, by late July, was teetering between
shocking and refreshing.</p>
<p>We envied the father and daughter who belonged to the lone tent, because
at Chapel Rock, we had to head back. The fancifully eroded sandstone
spire, topped by a lone white pine, stands alongside a creek, where a
bunch of people were playing in the water.</p>
<p>We walked back into the forest, accompanied by another chorus of
chipmunks.</p>
<p>We were headed around Lake Superior, so we had to move on.</p>
<p>But when we have a spare week, we'll be back to hike the whole thing.
The camping is primitive, but the amenities — sun, sand and non-stop
Lake Superior vistas — are pure luxury.</p>
