<h2>Famous for its moose and wolves, this Lake Superior wilderness island is beguiling.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/s/isle_royale_ferry.jpg" alt="Isle Royale Queen in Rock Harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When it rains on Isle Royale, you just have to soak it up.</p>
<p>Moisture comes with the territory in Lake Superior's northern reaches.
No one comes here for the weather, despite early advertising that called
it a &quot;Summertime 'Bermuda' Paradise.&quot;</p>
<p>Bermuda it's not. But paradise? It depends on how you look at it.</p>
<p>On the trails, I noticed, the drizzle made colors pop from their
glistening green backdrop — the orange flesh of a toppled cedar, the
red and white of baneberry, the blue of a bead lily.</p>
<p>The skies were gray out on Scoville Point, but the air felt as soft as a
shawl. Underfoot, the rock pulsated with life, like a coral reef. The
closer I looked, the more I saw — water bugs skittering on tiny ponds,
lichen clinging to fissures, harebells swinging in the breeze.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Each square foot was lovely, a veritable riot of life. Still, the
smaller life forms are not what most people come to see on Isle Royale
National Park.</p>
<p>&quot; 'Where can I see a moose?' — that's what they all want to
know,&quot; said ranger Valerie Newman.</p>
<p>I'd made peace with the rain by the third day of my August visit.
Heading along Rock Harbor Trail in the cool drizzle, I thought about who
would like this kind of weather.</p>
<p>&quot;Moose can't tolerate temperatures much above 55 degrees,&quot; Newman had
said during an evening program. &quot;They have no way to sweat, so they
need to cool their bodies off.&quot;</p>
<p>I looked up, and there was a cow with her calf, browsing in bushes just
off the trail. I'd once felt the weight of a moose hoof — the
business end of a formidable weapon — so I froze and counted to two
minutes, supposedly the length of a moose's attention span.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/s/isle_royale_moose.jpg" alt="A moose calf on Isle Royale." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A moose calf browsing for food along a trail in Isle Royale eyes a

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;Stay still and hope she forgets you,&quot; Newman had said. &quot;She knows
you're something, just not what. If you wait a few minutes, she'll
think, 'Hmm, that plant looks good.'&quot;</p>
<p>I got the sense that Mama knew I was there and didn't care, but the
calf gave me the big hairy eyeball. When I moved a little closer and
took a few photos, it bolted a few yards, then settled down when its
mother just kept eating.</p>
<p>Behind me, Kathy LaFontain of Toledo, Ohio, crept up the trail and
watched, too. But she hadn't brought her camera, and after a few
minutes, she dashed away to fetch it and her friend.</p>
<p>But the moose didn't wait. Mother and calf were on a mission, steadily
eating their way from one side of the trail to the other, putting on fat
for winter. LaFontain returned only to see their backsides disappearing
into thick woods.</p>
<p>&quot;They look so big and clumsy and lummoxy, and then they move away
without making a sound,&quot; she said admiringly.</p>
<h3>Chasing moose</h3>
<p>For many, moose are the marquee attraction on Isle Royale, a
45-mile-long land mass surrounded by tiny islands. The island is part of
Michigan, but it's closest to Ontario and most easily reached from
Minnesota.</p>
<p>Around 1900, moose migrated from Minnesota and were free of predators
for nearly 50 years, until Lake Superior froze and a pair of wolves
scampered over.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/s/isle_royale_canoe.jpg" alt="Canoeing on Isle Royale's Tobin Harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Summer visitors paddle across Isle Royale's Tobin Harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nps.gov/isro/learn/nature/wolf-moose-populations.htm">Populations of predator and
prey</a>
seesaw back and forth, studied and documented by researchers from
Michigan Technological University in Houghton since 1958.</p>
<p>The heat-sensitive moose are stressed: A warmer climate stops the
1,000-pound animals from eating as much food as they need to survive the
winter; in winter, ticks latch on by the tens of thousands, weakening
moose through blood loss and by distracting them from eating; and there
are fewer balsam firs, their preferred food.</p>
<p>But their only predators on the island, wolves, became inbred and weak.
Between 2012 and 2018, when the number of wolves dwindled from nine to
just two, the population of moose doubled, from 750 to 1,500.</p>
<p>That makes Isle Royale one of the best places in the world to see moose.</p>
<p>As I hiked along, I was joined by Elliot Stephens and Sarah Kidnie of
Clinton Township, Mich., who said they'd seen moose four times, twice
at the Rock Harbor campground.</p>
<p>The two college students said they'd planned to backpack, but when they
hoisted their 80-pound packs, filled with $200 worth of deli food and a
daily change of clothes, they changed their minds.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;We picked up our packs, walked to the first campsite and said, 'This
looks fine,'&quot; Stephens said ruefully.</p>
<p>Ironically, busy Rock Harbor may be the best place to see wildlife in
summer. The moose know wolves avoid people, so they hang out nearby. And
red foxes know where there are people, there's food.</p>
<p>&quot;We were cooking some shrimp, and four foxes came up,&quot; Stephens said.
&quot;They were circling around, and I thought they were going to try to
take us down.&quot;</p>
<p>We took shelter from the rain for a while in Suzy's Cave, named for
Suzy Tooker, an island girl who liked to play there. Then, I headed back
on the Tobin Harbor Trail, stopping to admire the extravagant flora:
curtains of moss, clusters of pearly everlasting, the waxy pink petals
of the pipsissewa, or &quot;prince's pine.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the middle of the afternoon, and I began to pass tarp-draped
backpackers, fresh off the ferry. The light rain wasn't enough to
explain their dejected demeanor, and later I heard why: Nearly all of
them had become ill in 9- to 10-foot waves that had kicked up soon after
they'd left Copper Harbor.</p>
<p>When I reached the harbor, I saw a deckhand wielding a giant hose on the
decks of the Ranger III from Houghton, whose passengers had suffered the
same fate.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Weather report</h3>
<p>You have to really want to be on Isle Royale, because it's not fast,
cheap or always pleasant to get there. Yellowstone gets more people in
one day than Isle Royale gets in a year; of all the national parks, it
gets the fewest visitors, about 17,000 annually.</p>
<p>And once there, a visitor may be subject to savage weather in
&quot;hypothermia country,&quot; as former ranger Nevada Barr put it in her
mystery novel &quot;A Superior Death.&quot;</p>
<p>When I was there in early August, peak season, I was prohibited from
using the canoe that came with my cottage, even in calm Tobin Harbor,
because of high winds on the lake. The nature walks, sightseeing cruises
and hiking shuttles I'd planned to take were canceled because of wind
and rain.</p>
<p>But I got to hear two evening programs, one given by the two artists in
residence, and I had two fine dinners in the restaurant.</p>
<p>When I could get out and explore, the inclement weather made me hunker
down and really look at the little things - and on Isle Royale in
particular, God is in the details.</p>
<p>And then, on my last day, the sun came out.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the island sprang into action. At 9 a.m., I hopped on the M.V.
Sandy excursion boat for the twice-weekly guided trip to Lookout Louise,
named for another of the island's adventurous little girls.</p>
<p>Soon, we rounded Scoville Point, where some of the island's last
residents still spend summers. After the island became a national park
in 1940, residents and their children were given a lease for life; a
dozen cabins remain, as do traces of the fisheries, copper mines and
resorts that once flourished.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/s/isle_royale_moose_full_size.jpg" alt="A moose calf grazes on Isle Royale." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Moose benefit from the dwindling number of wolves.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the other side of Tobin Harbor, the captain dropped us off, and we
started climbing up the ridge, passing Hidden Lake. Moose often come to
the lake to lick sodium deposits, said ranger Newman, pointing to a
much-nibbled balsam she said looked &quot;worse than a Charlie Brown
Christmas tree.&quot;</p>
<p>The short hike was a microcosm of the island's many faces. Along a
boardwalk over a bog, I found a purple-fringed orchid, one of 32
varieties there. Farther up, Newman pointed to the old man's beard
lichen that clung to the lower branches of a dying tree and asked if we
knew why that should bring a smile to our faces.</p>
<p>&quot;It tells you you're breathing some of the cleanest air on the
planet,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In a meadow, she said, archaeologists had found traces of copper mining
from 4,500 years ago. And even we could see signs of a more recent
attempt — the meadow had been burned, which stripped off vegetation
and heated rock outcroppings; miners then poured on cold lake water,
which fractured the rock and revealed veins of copper.</p>
<p>Like the Keweenaw Peninsula, Isle Royale yielded up its copper. But
despite many attempts, the isolated mines never made much money.</p>
<p>&quot;That great big lake out there led to the end of the mining eras,&quot;
Newman said.</p>
<p>Loggers tried to extract money, too. Logging wasn't attempted on a
large scale until 1935, when the Mead Co. built a camp on Siskiwit Bay;
only a year later, its slash piles fed a forest fire that burned more
than 26,000 acres, a fifth of the island.</p>
<p>It spurred faster action to create the national park, which had been
authorized in 1931.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/s/isle_royale_tobin_harbor.jpg" alt="Tobin Harbor on Isle Royale." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Tobin Harbor, which reaches far into the island, usually is calm.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At Lookout Louise, we all admired the view of the archipelago below,
mirrored by an armada of clouds lined up in the sky, and the Ontario
mainland in the distance.</p>
<p>Then, everyone else went back to the boat, and I headed off down the
42-mile Greenstone Ridge Trail. This ridge, which forms the spine of the
9-mile-wide island, is thought by many geologists to be part of the
largest lava flow on Earth.</p>
<p>It was as close to heaven as a person can get on Isle Royale. Swiveling
my head to take in views on both sides, I soaked up the sun and helped
myself to handfuls of ripe raspberries and thimbleberries, whose
voluptuous bushes crowded the trail.</p>
<p>It would have been a bear's heaven, too, except there aren't any bears
on Isle Royale.</p>
<p>By the time I reached the Mount Franklin overlook, five scenic miles and
two hours later, I'd seen only one party of hikers and a lone canoe,
sitting on the trail.</p>
<p>It was another two miles down to Three Mile Campground, and three miles
along Tobin Harbor to Rock Harbor, where I had to catch the ferry back
to Copper Harbor.</p>
<p>Rain had been fine — but on Isle Royale, blue skies are even better.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: <a href="http://www.nps.gov/isro">Isle Royale National Park</a> in Lake Superior</h3>
<p><em>When to go</em> : July and August are peak months. The park is open from
mid-April through October, but spring and fall can be harsh. Black flies
can be annoying in June.</p>
<p><em>What to know</em> : Despite the French origins of its name, given by fur
traders to honor Louis XIV, the island is pronounced ROY-al.</p>
<p>There's a daily user fee of $7 for everyone 16 and older. It can be
paid online in advance. A season pass costs $60 and covers an
additional three adults traveling with the pass holder.</p>
<p>The park newspaper, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/isro/greenstone-newspaper.htm">the
Greenstone</a>, is very
helpful in planning trips.</p>
<p>Weather can thwart plans, especially for canoeists and kayakers, so have
a backup plan. Those staying in a cottage or motel room should make
lodging and ferry reservations at the same time, since one or the other
may sell out on a particular day.</p>
<p><em>Getting there from Grand Portage, Minn.</em> : On the <a href="http://www.isleroyaleboats.com">Grand Portage-Isle
Royale Transportation Line</a>, the
Voyageur II makes the 7½-hour trip to Rock Harbor from mid-May to early
October, leaving at 7:30 a.m. from Grand Portage.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/h/thimbleberry2.jpg" alt="Thimbleberries on the Superior Hiking Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Thimbleberries ripen along the Greenstone Trail in August.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The Monday-Wednesday-Saturday trip during high season reaches Windigo,
on the western side of the island, in only 2½ hours, but makes other
stops on the northern side of the island on its way to Rock Harbor.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday, the boat leaves Rock Harbor at 8 a.m.,
returning along the south side of the island. (Note: Isle Royale is part
of Michigan, so it's on Eastern time, an hour ahead.)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.isleroyaleboats.com/day-trips.html">Day trips</a> leave at
8:30 a.m. and return at 3:30 p.m., giving visitors four hours at
Windigo. Reservations are required. 888-746-2305.</p>
<p>In Grand Portage, rooms at the <a href="http://www.grandportage.com">Grand Portage Lodge &amp;
Casino</a> are convenient. There's also a
campground at the marina.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/visiting-grand-portage/">Life on the Grand
Portage</a>.</p>
<p><em>Getting there from Copper Harbor, Mich.:</em> The <a href="http://www.isleroyale.com">Isle Royale Queen
IV</a> makes the three-hour trip to Rock Harbor
from mid-May through September. In July, they run every day except
Wednesday, daily from August through Labor Day.</p>
<p>Since the boat leaves Copper Harbor at 8 a.m., you'll need to stay
overnight. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/copper-harbor-michigan/">Copper Harbor
refuge</a>.</p>
<p><em>Getting there from Houghton, Mich</em> .: The park service's <a href="https://www.nps.gov/isro/planyourvisit/ranger-iii-info.htm">Ranger
III</a> makes
the six-hour trip to Rock Harbor at 9 a.m. Tuesdays and Fridays,
returning at 9 a.m. Wednesdays and Saturdays. Passengers get discounts
on fares if they buy a package at Rock Harbor Lodge. Reserve online or
at 906-482-0984.</p>
<p><em>Getting there from Hancock, Mich., or Grand Marais, Minn</em> : Fly with
<a href="https://isleroyaleseaplanes.com/">Isle Royale Seaplanes</a>.</p>
<p><em>Wildlife-watching</em> : By 2016, just two inbred wolves lived on the
island, not nearly enough to keep the population of 1,300 moose in
check.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/s/isle_royale_cabin.jpg" alt="A Windigo cabin at Isle Royale." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Rock Harbor Lodge</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
There are two camper cabins at Windigo.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Longtime researcher Rolf Peterson recommended that new wolves be
introduced, and 15 new wolves were brought to the island in the winter
of 2018-19. Another three came in September 2019.</p>
<p>Moose often are seen. Foxes frequently are seen around campgrounds and
lodgings.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nps.gov/isro/planyourvisit/day-hiking.htm"><strong>Hiking</strong></a> :
The <a href="https://www.backpacker.com/trips/best-100-miles-scoville-point-loop-isle-royale-national-park-mi">Scoville Point
loop</a>
is four of the best 100 miles in the national-park system, according to
Backpacker magazine.</p>
<p>Or hike any part of the 42-mile <a href="https://www.hikingproject.com/trail/7004160/greenstone-ridge-trail">Greenstone Ridge
Trail</a>, which spans the island from Rock Harbor to Windigo Harbor.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : In fine weather, camping is the way to go on Isle
Royale. Unfortunately, it's often cold, rainy and windy on the island,
and then visitors are glad to have a room or cottage, despite the high
prices and lack of charm.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rockharborlodge.com">Rock Harbor Lodge</a> is run by a
concessionaire called Forever Resorts: 866-644-2003 in winter,
906-337-4993 in summer. It's not really a lodge; the restaurant and
gift shop are in a building on the harbor, the office is in another
building nearby, and rooms are in 1960s motel-style units facing the
water.</p>
<p>Utilitarian duplex housekeeping cottages, also 1960s-vintage, are on a
wooded hill over the harbor. Rates include 6 percent sales tax, 3
percent room assessment tax and 21 percent utility surcharge.</p>
<p>All lodgings are quite expensive, especially during peak season, July
15-Aug. 15.</p>
<p>There are also two rustic <a href="https://www.rockharborlodge.com/windigo-camper-cabins">camper
cabins</a> at
Windigo, which book up quickly. They sleep six in bunk beds and have
electricity but not plumbing.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/s/isleroyale_rockharbortrail_nps250.jpg" alt="Rock Harbor Trail in Isle Royale." /><p class="copyright">&copy; NPS</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Rock Harbor Trail follows the rocky shoreline of the Rock Harbor
Channel.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Camping</em> : Permits for tent sites at 36 campgrounds and 88 screened,
three-sided shelters can be obtained at the ranger stations on the
island.</p>
<p>Groups of seven or more can reserve sites in advance. For smaller
parties, use is first-come, first-served; in peak season, there's often
competition for the shelters, and campers are expected to share sites if
needed.</p>
<p><em>Dining</em> : Rock Harbor restaurant serves pretty good food, with such
entrees as fresh lake trout and pork chops with wild-blueberry glaze.
Prices are high, but reasonable for the location. The Greenstone Grill
serves burgers, pizza and snacks.</p>
<p><em>Sightseeing</em> : From Rock Harbor, the M.V. Sandy offers sightseeing
cruises as well as cruises that include visits to such sites as the
Minong Mine, Edisen Fishery, Passage Island and Rock Harbor Lighthouse.</p>
<p>From Rock Harbor and Windigo visitors centers, rangers lead hikes and
give programs on natural and cultural history; check for times when you
arrive.</p>
<p><em>Volunteering</em> : Every year, the <a href="http://www.isleroyalewolf.org/">Wolf-Moose
project</a> seeks
<a href="http://www.isleroyalewolf.org/participate/participate/explorers.html">volunteers</a>
to go on a weeklong backpacking trip in the backcountry with
researchers. Volunteers will search for moose bones and collect data.</p>
<p>Volunteers pay a $450 tax-deductible contribution. All food is
supplied, but volunteers pay their own way to the island.</p>
<p><em>Background</em> : Nevada Barr's 1994 mystery novel &quot;A Superior Death&quot;
draws heavily on her experiences as an NPS ranger on the island and
includes fascinating details about the island, especially its
shipwrecks, frequented by sport divers.</p>
<p>In 2008, she wrote about Isle Royale's moose-wolf study in the darker
&quot;Winter Study.&quot;</p>
