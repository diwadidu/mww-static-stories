<h2>Bald eagles are drawn to this Mississippi River town, along with flocks of binocular-toting visitors.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wabasha_wapasha_statue.jpg" alt="Chief Wapasha statue." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Along the Mississippi River, the fortunes of Wabasha have risen right
along with the once-endangered bald eagle.</p>
<p>Eagles reappeared slowly after DDT was banned in 1972, and one of the
first places they could be seen was in this Minnesota town, just
downriver from the mouth of the Chippewa River, which kept water open in
winter so eagles could fish.</p>
<p>The city built a deck downtown and staffed it with spotting scopes and
volunteers from November through March.</p>
<p>Then it started a makeshift eagle center behind an empty storefront, and
in 2007, it opened the National Eagle Center in a handsome brick
building on the river banks.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Bald eagles now can be seen up and down the river. But Wabasha still is
one of the best places to see them.</p>
<p>A friend and I drove there one December, pulling off U.S. 61 just north
of Wabasha at Camp Lacupolis. Instant success: Four bald eagles sat on a
sand bar in the Mississippi, scanning the water for fish.</p>
<p>A juvenile eagle perched in an oak tree, its brown head and tail
blending with the branches. Nearby, a tangle of sticks marked the
beginning of a nest.</p>
<p>Wabasha also is famous as the setting of the 1993 film  &quot;Grumpy Old
Men.&quot; The comedy about two eccentric ice fishermen does capture the
town's flavor, locals say.</p>
<p>The city is the only one north of Winona that's not separated from the
river by a highway or rail line. Along Main Street, the brick
storefronts have changed little over the decades.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wabasha_eagle_center2.jpg" alt="Wabasha's National Eagle Center." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>In winter, with its quiet streets, old-fashioned lampposts and
still-operating Gambles store, it looks like another movie setting:
Bedford Falls of Frank Capra's &quot;It's a Wonderful Life.&quot;</p>
<p>That December day was unseasonably warm, so we drove up the bluffs to
the Kruger Trail in Dorer Memorial State Hardwood Forest.</p>
<p>From a campground thick with red pines, we hiked a mile to an overlook
with a spectacular view of the Zumbro River, winding into the horizon
with so many oxbow loops it looked like a piece of ribbon candy.</p>
<p>Then we drove back to U.S. 61, on the way spotting eight deer gamboling
on a Zumbro sandbar. We turned right onto LARK Lane, which leads to
other wildlife — the fantastical figures of a hand-carved carousel,
the centerpiece of a little complex of shops on the hill.</p>
<p>The late Donn Kreofsky — LARK stands for Lost Arts Revival by Kreofsky
— designed all 26 of the carousel's basswood beasts. There's a
pop-eyed goldfish and a giraffe with orangutans dangling from its neck.
A river otter wears a string of freshwater-clam shells, representing the
button industry that once flourished on Lake Pepin.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura visited, he rode the
carousel's Celestial Chariot and commented, &quot;This is art, this real
art.&quot;</p>
<p>Kreofsky began creating old-fashioned wooden toys in 1983, in response
to the plastic goods that fill most toy stores, and he sold them with
reproductions of classic tin and wind-up toys in his Boomer Heaven
shop.</p>
<p>Before his death in 2010, he sold the complex. Boomer Heaven is gone,
replaced by a shop selling gag gifts and novelty items. In the main
shop, the new owners sell some wooden and classic toys, as well as quite
a few plastic ones.</p>
<p>Back in Wabasha, we stopped by the National Eagle Center. Anyone who
can't find eagles roosting in nearby trees can see them close-up at the
riverfront center, where four bald eagles live.</p>
<p>Volunteers give programs every day and offer to pose the eagles with
visitors. When I was there soon after its opening, a volunteer took 
Columbia for one of the daily feeding programs. She wasn't hungry,
though.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wabasha_sign.jpg" alt="Old sign in Wabasha." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Wabasha always has played to its strength: It's right on the
Mississippi River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>As he talked about eagle habits, Columbia flapped her wings and tried to
break loose from his arm, and we instantly realized where the terms
&quot;spread eagle&quot; and &quot;feathers were flying&quot; originated.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, you see why I told you not to sit in the front row,&quot; the
volunteer said to his audience of nine. &quot;This is about eight people too
many for Columbia.&quot;</p>
<p>Again, she tried to break loose, emitting the high-pitched squawk that
seems so incongruous for such an intimidating bird.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like holding onto a 10-pound yo-yo,&quot; remarked one onlooker.</p>
<p>&quot;With rockets on it,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>Latsch a male bald eagle hatched in 2016, is the youngest eagle and has
a malformed left eye. All of the eagles were injured and are unable to
survive on their own.</p>

Bypassed by the highway, downtown Wabasha has changed little over the
decades.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The center's exhibits also include a multimedia object theater devoted
to the Wapasha line of Dakota chiefs and a floor depiction of the
Mississippi River flyway. The side facing the river is floor-to-ceiling
glass, allowing visitors to watch for eagles inside on subzero days.</p>
<p>Tonier businesses have sprung up downtown; there's a kimono gallery and
an espresso shop that sells gourmet chocolate.</p>
<p>On the riverfront, Eagles Landing condos have replaced the Big Jo flour
mill. A sidewalk runs in front of them, so visitors can stroll along
the river to the plaza in front of the Eagle Center.</p>
<p>Eagles and tourists have come to Wabasha, but it's still the sedate old
town it's always been.</p>
<p>&quot;They didn't mall it up,&quot; resident Phyllis Kennebeck told us. &quot;It's
sort of a pokier community, but that's the beauty of it.&quot;</p>
