<h2>On Wisconsin's Chippewa River, a little train rolls into a bird-watcher's Eden.</h2>

<p>If you don't know a birder, you might think they have a severe case of
attention-deficit disorder.</p>
<p>They tend to stare off into space. They often stop talking mid-sentence.
It's hard to finish conversations with them.</p>
<p>But their enthusiasm for nature is contagious. And in spring, birders
know all the best places to go.</p>
<p>One May, I followed a bunch of them to Durand, Wis., where we all hopped
onto little yellow train cars and chugged into the Tiffany Wildlife
Area, a bird-filled jungle along the Chippewa River.</p>
<p>Built in 1882, this 14-mile stretch of rail line was used to haul lumber
to the Mississippi River. It was abandoned in 1977, and cars used by
maintenance crews now carry groups of nature-lovers into a green
cathedral of sloughs and wetlands.</p>
<p>The silt-prone Chippewa has created the most extensive river delta in
the Midwest. At its mouth, it dumped sediment that backs up the
Mississippi River into Lake Pepin, its widest spot.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>South of Durand, both banks are part of the wildlife area and the
Tiffany Bottoms state natural area. There, dead trees provide dens for
wildlife, and beaver dams create a watery maze in which insects thrive.</p>
<p>It's paradise for raptors and shorebirds as well as migratory waterfowl
and songbirds, who stop to rest and feed on their way north.</p>
<p>&quot;Spring is really fun because you feel like your old friends are coming
back,&quot; said my friend Karen, an avid birder.</p>
<p>Our first stop was in a back yard, where the birders lifted their
binoculars to track goldfinches, bluebirds and a bald eagle. Their ears
were just as busy as their eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a rose-breasted grosbeak still singing over there,&quot; Karen
said. &quot;It sounds like a robin, but it just keeps going.&quot; Then she heard
a throaty rumble: &quot;Sandhill crane!&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/durand_birder_rail.jpg" alt="Birder on the Chippewa River sloughs." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>She was good, but birding prodigy Chris West of Richland Center, Wis.,
was even better. He's a guide who's traveled the world since he was a
teen-ager: &quot;I've always had a pair of binoculars in my hand,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>When another birder described the call of a field sparrow as a bouncing
ping-pong ball, West whistled it, then put it into words —
&quot;Like-what? Like-what?&quot;</p>
<p>We chugged farther down the line, passing two channel sloughs, then got
out again.</p>
<p>West cocked his head and listened, like a surgeon to a heartbeat.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a pie-billed grebe,&quot; he said. &quot;Overhead, there's a gnatcatcher;
you can hear the little 'seep-seep-seep,' &quot; he said. &quot;And there's a
song sparrow. And a red-shouldered hawk and a red-bellied woodpecker.&quot;</p>
<p>A man from Manitowoc, Wis., listened, open-mouthed.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they make it up,&quot; he said. &quot;That's unbelievable.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The cold and dampness was keeping most birds in the bushes, so the
birders had to use their ears. Local artist Gail Pommerening, who sells
paintings of birds in nearby Alma, said she had come to learn their
songs.</p>
<p>&quot;I've always loved birds, but I'm a slow learner,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Karen showed her one of the tricks of the trade.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, there's a towhee,&quot; she said. &quot;Did you hear that? 'Drink your
tea' — that's a mnemonic that works for me.&quot;</p>
<p>The year before, 76 species were identified on the spring trip; that
day, we wouldn't do so well. Some of us looked down instead of up,
spotting clumps of blue wood phlox in the woods, unfurling ferns and
interesting weeds underfoot.</p>
<p>Right between the tracks, one woman identified bedstraw, once used to
stuff mattresses because its scent repels fleas. Another pointed out
plantain and yarrow: &quot;You'll never starve out here,&quot; she said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/durand_minitrain_savoy.jpg" alt="Birders on the Chippewa River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A washed-out bridge marked the turn-around point of our 20-mile round
trip, and we stopped to eat our bag lunches and explore the gully and
sagging bridge.</p>
<p>On the way back, we stopped to see a huge bald-eagle nest and its
occupant. We also saw the wreckage from the derailment that caused the
Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific to abandon the line.</p>
<p>&quot;It was nothing but problems,&quot; said Arlyn Colby of the Chippewa Valley
Motor Car Association, which maintains the cars and track. &quot;Either there
was a flood, or ice dams - the pressure built up, then washed it out.
The train derailed right here — it hit the bridge, and one box car
turned over right into the slough, and three cars tipped over.&quot;</p>
<p>This fecund land reclaims what goes into it. Branches of toppled trees
melted into the soil. Pools of water, reflecting clouds, were black with
organic matter. Honeysuckle hugged the tracks — invasive, but fragrant
and beloved by birds.</p>
<p>&quot;On a nice day, this is so beautiful,&quot; Colby said.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Birds, birds, everywhere</h3>
<p>Eventually, the skies cleared and a hazy sun helped us shake off the
chill. After the mini-train trip, we drove down to the Mississippi and
Alma, where the Wings Over Alma nature center sponsors the trips.</p>
<p>Then we headed farther down the river to one of my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=221992&amp;id=104777055128">favorite
places</a>,
the Prairie Moon Sculpture Garden between Cochrane and <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/fountain-city-wisconsin/">Fountain
City</a>.</p>
<p>I looked at Herman Rusch's folk art and at clumps of lupines, but Karen
headed straight for the willows and bushes, where she spotted a vireo,
flicker and yellow-bellied sapsucker.</p>
<p>&quot;There's all kinds of things going on there,&quot; she said. &quot;This is
great habitat.&quot;</p>
<p>On the way out of Alma, we saw two bald eagles sitting in a dead tree
and six egrets at Rieck's Lake, best-known for hosting tundra swans in
November.</p>
<p>We were staying at the Round Hill House across the river from Durand,
and there were two phoebes nesting in the eaves across from our door.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/durand_river_house.jpg" alt="Round Hill on the Chippewa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The house, once a Catholic retreat center, is right on the Chippewa
River, and in the morning, we watched swallows diving and kingfishers
stalking fish from a sandbar near the banks.</p>
<p>Vintage birdhouses — an acorn, a beehive — hung from trees on the
grounds, and a chorus of birds called from the woods behind the house.</p>
<p>As I admired the three shades of lilacs and dainty columbines along the
portico, Karen made a list of birds she'd seen or heard, including six
kinds of sparrow, an ovenbird, a black and white warbler and the Eastern
towhee.</p>
<p>Her greatest find came in the oak and maple woods near the house —
morel mushrooms. She came running back to the house with one enormous
morel and two medium-sized ones, and together we went back, hoping to
find a mother lode hiding in the leaves.</p>
<p>We looked and looked, as a sandhill crane circled overhead. We only
found two more, but as we prowled the grounds, we did find another
phoebe nest, this one with eggs.</p>
<p>On the Chippewa River in spring, life is busting out all over.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Birding by mini-train in western Wisconsin</h3>
<p><strong>Getting there</strong> : The mini-train ride
starts two miles south of Durand along Wisconsin 25. Durand is halfway
between Nelson, on the Mississippi River, and Menomonie.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wingsoveralma.org/events"><strong>Birding by Mini-Train</strong></a> :
Trips are offered in May and September. The five-hour trips cost $40
and include lunch. Tickets go fast, so reserve as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Several other conservation groups also schedule rides on the mini-train
through the year, and free rides are offered during Fun Fest in Durand
on the second weekend of June.</p>
