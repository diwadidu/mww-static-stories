<h2>In northern Minnesota, the man who loved bears left a legacy for thousands.</h2>

<p>Half a century ago, a Minnesota logger who lived in a forest full of
hungry bears decided that if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.</p>
<p>By the time he died at age 86, Vince Shute had fed generations of black
bears, become best friends with a bear named Brownie and inspired
bear-lovers all over the world.</p>
<p>Shute wasn't a sophisticated man, but he had a heart.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1942, Vince Shute had a logging camp, and it had a cookshack,&quot;
says Bill Lea of the American Bear Association. &quot;The bears would smell
those good smells and break into the shack. Now, Vince and his men were
afraid of bears, and every time one came, they'd shoot it. He said that
over the next 10 years, he killed scores of bears.</p>
<p>&quot;So finally, Vince came up with another plan. He thought, 'Maybe if I
put food outside the cabin, they won't break in.' Well, it worked.
What Vince didn't count on is that he would end up feeding these bears
for nearly 50 years.&quot;</p>
<p>Every day, some of the 80 bears in the forest near Orr, just south of
Voyageurs National Park, would drop by for a snack, depending on what
else they could find in the woods.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>As Shute aged, volunteers began helping him at his homestead, and in
1996, they built a raised wooden observation deck for the thousands of
people who showed up to watch him feed the bears.</p>
<p>Today, it's the Vince Shute Wildlife Sanctuary, where volunteer
naturalists explain the behavior of the bears who come out of the woods
to feast on apples, dates, dog food, sunflower seeds and any other food</p>
<ul>
<li>as wilderness campers know, bears aren't picky.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I visited, Bill Lea had flown in from his home in North Carolina.
As his wife, Klari, walked around the grounds with a green bucket,
laying food on stumps and hollowed-out logs, Lea talked to the tourists
on the observation deck.</p>
<p>&quot;Bears are smart, so we have a rule,&quot; he said. &quot;We always feed them
from green buckets, so they don't associate food with people; they
associate it with green buckets.&quot;</p>
<p>Bears shuffled around the feeding area, checking out the buffet. On the
edge of the clearing, two 1½-year-old cubs cowered. They'd just been
kicked out of the den, Lea said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/r/orr_bear_watchers.jpg" alt="People watching bears." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;We always feel sorry for these guys,&quot; he said. &quot;It's a scary time of
life for them. They're just getting out to get to know the world on
their own.&quot;</p>
<p>Cameras clicked as tourists, who come from all over the world,
photographed the cubs.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm a Girl Scout, so I know what to do if I see a bear,&quot; said Kirsten
Bowman of Jemison, Ala. &quot;Never run, don't faint, and scream.&quot;</p>
<p>Once, she said, she saw a bear in the wild, while hiking with her Girl
Scout troop in Tennessee: &quot;I jumped up and down and screamed, and he
went away.&quot;</p>
<p>These are wild animals, volunteers are careful to note, not Winnie the
Pooh. A sign near the entrance warns, &quot;Danger! Bears Look Tame But Are
Wild and Unpredictable.&quot;</p>
<p>Before the observation deck was built, Lea said, things were getting out
of hand. Tourists were pouring alcohol down bears' throats and giving
their children rides on bears' shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;We can manage the bears,&quot; he said. &quot;It's the people who are the
challenge.&quot;</p>
<p>More than 80 black bears frequent the sanctuary every summer, and every
night, hundreds of people come to see them. They look from a
3,000-square-foot observation platform that is connected by elevated
walkways to the spot where shuttle buses drop visitors.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>That protects bears from people — and vice versa.</p>
<p>Before the big observation platform was built, the parking lot was near
the feeding area, and sometimes, the people got loose.</p>
<p>&quot;We had a visitor who kept asking, 'Can I pet a bear, can I pet a bear?'
&quot; said Kim McGrath of the American Bear Association in Orr. &quot;We
explained why she couldn't, and why even <em>we</em> don't.</p>
<p>&quot;But on her way back to the car, she had an opportunity, and she ran
her hand right down that bear's back,&quot; McGrath said. &quot;Luckily, it
was a very tolerant bear. Had it been Oscar, she probably would've lost
an arm.&quot;</p>
<p>Even though volunteers, who come from all over the world, don't
fraternize with the bears, they get to know them well.</p>
<p>&quot;Each bear has a distinct personality,&quot; said volunteer Tim Halvorson.
&quot;There's one bear, I'm just in love with him. His name is Handsome, and
you could pour honey all over your legs and he wouldn't bother you.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/e/keweenaw_bear.jpg" alt="Bear eats blueberries on Keweenaw Peninsula" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;I just brought him up a blueberry pie,&quot; he added, with a sheepish
look. &quot;Now Oscar the Grouch, he tends to be dominant. And Lizzy does a
lot of bluff-charging. You get to know which ones tend to do that, and
you just avoid them.&quot;</p>
<p>Shute's favorites were Duffy, a gentle giant who became a poster bear
after the Associated Press photographed him eating cinnamon toast out of
Shute's mouth, and Brownie, whom Shute called &quot;my cop&quot; because he kept
the other bears in line.</p>
<p>Once, Shute nursed Brownie back to health on chicken-noodle soup after
he was shot by a hunter.</p>
<p>&quot;They had a special relationship; it was just a beautiful thing to
watch,&quot; Lea said. &quot;But we don't give people the message that you should
do that.&quot;</p>
<p>The bear association, McGrath said, has agonized over whether or not it
should continue feeding the bears, thereby giving visitors the
impression that they, too, can feed bears.</p>
<p>That's a dangerous practice because, from then on, bears will think of
that person's porch, or campsite, as a food source. A Voyageurs National
Park brochure puts it this way: &quot;Do not ever feed a bear. The next
visitor may be a 3-year-old with a jelly sandwich.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;We can't stress enough that we never would have started this, that
we're just managing a pre-existing condition,&quot; McGrath said.</p>
<p>&quot;We weighed the pros and cons, but we thought, 'What a really incredible
educational tool.' It's so incredible to be able to connect a person
with a real live bear. If they're seeing a bear, they're much more
willing to learn.&quot;</p>
<p>Recent visitors, she said, got to see a startling real-life scenario
when Elsie, a first-time mother, kicked her yearling cubs out of the
den, a move that's necessary because males may kill cubs that still are
hanging around a mother in estrus.</p>
<p>&quot;One cub understood right away and scooted up a tree, but the other was
not getting the message,&quot; McGrath said. &quot;It was violent and very loud;
she was beating him up. It was terrible for the humans to watch. They
were stunned.&quot;</p>
<p>However, other visitors got to watch a mother bear pull a cub onto her
lap and nurse him, she said.</p>
<p>It's appropriate, said Bill Lea, that the Vince Shute Wildlife Sanctuary
honors a man who himself got quite an education about bears.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, we all know you shouldn't feed bears,&quot; Lea said. &quot;We don't
honor him because he fed the bears, but because he cared enough to
change his lifestyle, so he could peacefully exist with his black-bear
neighbors.&quot;</p>
