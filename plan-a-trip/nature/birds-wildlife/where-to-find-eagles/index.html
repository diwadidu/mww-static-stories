<h2>In winter, the cold forces the birds to go where they're easier to see.</h2>

<p>If you want to find eagles, the most important thing to know is they
work only as hard as they have to.</p>
<p>When lakes up north start to freeze, eagles will head for the nearest
open patch of water. In December, that's often on the northern
stretches of the Mississippi River flyway, between <em>Red Wing</em> and
<em>Wabasha, Minn.</em></p>
<p>&quot;They're still trying to decide where to spend the winter,&quot; says Pat
Manthey of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.</p>
<p>&quot;We call them indeterminate migrators. They're not like the swallows
of Capistrano that come back every year. Eagles only go as far as they
need to go to find what they need.&quot;</p>
<p>If there's a cold snap in December, they'll head south, sometimes as far
as Illinois. But some will stop below a dam or at the mouth of a river,
and if the fishing is good, they'll stay.</p>
<p>Some discover commercial fishing operations, such as the one in
<em>Ferryville, Wis.,</em>  where they can wait for cast-off fish.</p>
<p>Others find a field where hog or poultry farmers have discarded dead
animals or ground them up and spread them with manure.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;(One year), I was sending people to a road between Independence and
Arcadia in Wisconsin because 200 to 300 eagles were sitting in a farm
field eating chicken guts,&quot; said naturalist MaryBeth Garrigan.</p>
<p>In the bluff country of northeast Iowa, the famous <em>Decorah</em> eagles
spend the winter where they know they'll have a plentiful supply of
food — right above a fish hatchery.</p>
<p>The pair is tracked as they travel, then shown via
<a href="https://explore.org/livecams/bald-eagles/decorah-eagles">livestream</a>
after they return to Decorah in late fall to prepare the nest for eggs.
Another pair, the <a href="https://www.raptorresource.org/birdcams/decorah-north-nest/">Decorah
North</a>
eagles, also are shown as they mate, incubate eggs and raise their
eaglets.</p>
<p>For more web cams, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagle-bear-cams/">Wildlife reality show</a>.</p>
<p>Other eagles spend the whole winter around <em>Prairie du Sac, Wis.,</em>
picking off fish stunned by a hydroelectric dam on the Wisconsin River.
The local eagle council offers weekly <a href="https://ferrybluffeaglecouncil.org/events-calendar/bus-tours/">bus
tours</a>.</p>
<p>But eventually, snow drives most eagles out of the fields and toward the
Mississippi River.</p>
<p>&quot;Usually, the birds get going in January, and then we'll see them for
the next few weekends,&quot; said Terry Ingram of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EagleNatureFoundation">Eagle Nature
Foundation</a> in <em>Galena,
Ill.,</em> which has offered field trips by bus.</p>
<p>&quot;Every week is different. Once a group of eagles was moving through
when we were in Green Island, just south of <em>Bellevue, Iowa,</em> and we
had 100 of them surrounding the bus.&quot;</p>
<p>For a list of eagle-watching tours and festivals, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagle-watching/">Where eagles
land</a>.</p>
<p>Eagle watchers on the Upper Mississippi actually welcome snow and severe
cold, because it forces the eagles to congregate where there's open
water.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/a/eagle_dam.jpg" alt="An eagle looks for fish at the lock and dam in Genoa, Wis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>&quot;Eagles have no sense of smell, so they have to depend on their
eyesight,&quot; Garrigan says. &quot;Once it snows, they have to move to the
river and depend on fishing.&quot;</p>
<p>Besides open water, they need a protected place to sleep, such as a
valley with big, mature oak trees.</p>
<p>From there, they'll fly to the river in the mornings, just after
daybreak, then return to their roosts until mid-afternoon, when they'll
make another fishing trip to stock up for the night.</p>
<p>When it's very cold, the eagles hunker down in cottonwoods along the
river, conserving energy. For the best chance of seeing them fly, go out
early on a warm day after a cold snap, when they'll be hunting for
food.</p>
<p>In February, eagles that had flown south start to move north, typically
reaching Minnesota by March. And as the weather warms, eagles start to
show courting behavior.</p>
<p>For the best luck finding eagles, go early in the day or later in the
afternoon. Dress warmly and bring binoculars. Along rivers, look for
dark blobs in cottonwood trees.</p>
<p>If you get close, don't startle the eagles by slamming car doors or
making sudden movements, or they may return to their evening roosts with
empty stomachs, wasting the energy they need to survive in the severe
cold.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, the most reliable place to see eagles is <em>Reads Landing,</em>
a tiny settlement across from the mouth of the Chippewa River just north
of <em>Wabasha.</em></p>
<p>Often, eagles fly overhead. There's also a nearby pullout on Minnesota
61 at <em>Camp Lacupolis.</em></p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nationaleaglecenter.org">National Eagle Center</a> in
Wabasha is a guaranteed place to see eagles, since four bald eagles and
a golden eagle live there. Try to go during a feeding. The riverside
center also has scopes for visitors to use.</p>
<p>It also lists a <a href="https://www.nationaleaglecenter.org/eagle-count/">weekly count of wintering eagles in the area</a>, including
Reads Landing and, across the river, <em>Alma</em> and <em>Buffalo City.</em></p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagles-wabasha-/">All eyes on Wabasha</a>.</p>
<p>Farther down Minnesota 61, past its junction with I-90, the rest
stop/picnic area at <em>Dresbach</em> is a good place to spot eagles.</p>
<p>It's right across the river from Nelson Park at the northern tip of
French Island in <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/cruises-in-lacrosse/">La Crosse,
Wis.</a>, where there's a
waterfowl viewing platform.</p>
<p>To get to Nelson Park, take Wisconsin 35-53 to the Oktoberfest grounds
and turn west on Clinton Street. Go to Bainbridge Street and turn right.
Take a left on Goodard Street, which turns into Lakeshore Drive. Follow
it to the park.</p>
<p>In south-central Wisconsin, the dam on the Wisconsin River at <em>Prairie
du Sac</em> is a good place to see eagles. Hydroelectric turbines stun the
fish going through, making them easy pickings for eagles, and valleys
amid the bluffs provide sheltered roosts.</p>
<p><em>Dams on the Mississippi River</em> always are good places to look because
they keep patches of water open all winter. There are 12 locks and dams
between Minneapolis and Guttenberg, Iowa.</p>
<p>In <em>Alma, Wis.,</em>  across from Wabasha, the dam is right downtown, and
eagles are easily seen from a platform. At the dam in <em>Genoa, Wis.,</em>
eagles gather to feed on shad cast off by ice fishermen.</p>
<p>In winter, <em>sloughs</em> that are buggy and wet in summer are easily
navigated by snowshoe.</p>
<p>For information on a winter eagle-watching excursion between Wabasha,
Minn., and Genoa, Wis., see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/mississippi-winter/">Open sesame on the
sloughs</a>.</p>
<p>Farther south, look for eagles below Lock and Dam 13 in <em>Fulton, Ill.</em></p>
<p>When there's a cold snap farther north on the Mississippi, eagles migrate south. The Rock Island, Ill., district of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers <a href="https://www.mvr.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/Mississippi-River-Project/Education/Eagle-Watching/Eagle-Counts/">keeps count of the eagles</a> seen from Lock &amp; Dam 11 in Dubuque, Iowa, to the Missouri border.</p>
<p>On the <em>Illinois River</em>  near Ottawa, you can spot eagles from the <a href="https://www.mvr.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/Illinois-Waterway/">Illinois
Waterway Visitor
Center</a>
across from <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/starved-rock-park-illinois/"><strong>Starved Rock State
Park</strong></a>, where you can make a detour to see some of the park's spectacular
frozen waterfalls and canyons.</p>
