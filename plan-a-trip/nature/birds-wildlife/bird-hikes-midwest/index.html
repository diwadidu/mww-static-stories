<h2>In spring, a symphony of trills and chirps draws hikers into the woods.</h2>

On a guided hike in May, birders look for waterfowl in the Kickapoo

<p>In April, birds return to the woods.</p>
<p>They're easy to hear, but not to see. Unlike spring wildflowers, birds
don't stay put.</p>
<p>A flash of yellow likely is a warbler, but which kind —
chestnut-sided, Blackburnian, magnolia, Wilson's? And those tweets,
twitters and trills — who's making them?</p>
<p>It takes a finely tuned ear to pick out the songs in a babel of birds,
and a sharp eye to identify the singer.</p>
<p>That's why it's fun to tag along with an expert at one of the many
bird hikes offered this time of year. Usually, you can borrow a pair of
binoculars — and to see birds even closer, watch a bird-banding
demonstration.</p>
<p>In Minnesota state parks, there are birding hikes and programs every
weekend in spring. At Ridges Sanctuary in Door County, bird hikes are
offered every Saturday from May through August.</p>
<p>Nearly every nature center, refuge and preserve offers bird hikes,
especially in spring.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>One May, I went on a bird hike in Wisconsin's Kickapoo Valley Reserve,
led by Barbara Duerksen of the Wisconsin Society for Ornithology.</p>
<p>The unusual topography of the 8,569-acre reserve — prairie savannah
and marshes, cool valleys and sun-soaked cliffs — makes it breeding
habitat for more than 100 species of birds and a stop for many others
heading north to boreal forest.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest problem of birding here is figuring out where to go,
because there are a lot of great places,&quot; said Duerksen, who lives in
nearby Richland Center.</p>
<p>From the visitors center, we borrowed binoculars and walked down a trail
that the previous year, Duerksen said, had to be widened because a
snapping turtle made a nest on it.</p>
<p>Soon, she began picking out bird calls — the meow of a catbird, the
metallic chink of an Eastern towhee, the unison call of sandhill cranes
in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's go on, maybe we'll see some birds,&quot; she said. &quot;It seems as
if we ought to be able to see the towhee pretty close.&quot; But another
bird distracted her.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, hear that little descending squeal?&quot; she said. &quot;That's a
blue-gray gnatcatcher. They decorate their nests with lichen, and it
looks just like a knot on a branch. It has a little tiny downward
squeak; you can see it feeding.&quot;</p>

<h3>Looking and listening</h3>
<p>The morning was cool and gray, with a little mist — good for us,
because it kept the birds close to the ground and feasting on insects.</p>
<p>Overhead, someone spotted a brown bird hunkered on a bare branch, and we
all lifted our scopes and tried to find it; even with help, it was hard.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm thinking it's a nighthawk,&quot; Duerksen said. &quot;They're the ones
I tend to see or hear most around town. They have a bzzzt-bzzzt sound
when flying around; they make a rushing sound with their wings.&quot;</p>
<p>We were lucky, she said, to catch it roosting where we could see it.</p>
<p>&quot;Its feathers have markings that are just like lichen on a branch,&quot;
Duerksen said. &quot;Once you see something like this, you can fix the image
in your head, and it's easier to see it again.&quot;</p>
<p>We continued down the trail, into a stand of the white pines that were
fooled into flourishing far south of their normal habitat.</p>
<p>&quot;Hear that Tennessee warbler singing up ahead?&quot; Duerksen asked. &quot;It
has a three-part chirpy trill thing.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We passed a shale outcropping, and a deer shot past. But everyone was
looking at a bright-yellow warbler, which obligingly flew right into the
spot on which I'd trained my binoculars.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a common warbler — 'swee-swee-sweet, how sweet,' &quot; she
said.</p>
<p>Duerksen has been listening to birds for many years.</p>
<p>&quot;I have bad eyesight, and the first thing that attracted me about birds
is their songs,&quot; she said. &quot;The first thing I remember is asking my
mother the difference between a robin call and an oriole, and she knew.</p>
<p>&quot;I grew up in Kansas, and if you have Western meadowlark, you don't
need Prozac. It's instant cheer — you're going down the road, and
you hear this gorgeous bubbly song.&quot;</p>
<p>At the edge of a marsh, we watched red-winged blackbirds swinging from
the tops of cattails and swallows swooping overhead.</p>
<p>A deer stood on the opposite end of the marsh; as I looked at it through
my binoculars, I saw a coot pop its head out of the rushes, followed by
its partner.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/horicon_bird_banding2.jpg" alt="Bird banding at Horicon Marsh." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

newly banded bird.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Walking toward the Kickapoo River, we heard the gurgle of a cowbird and
the hollow tap of a yellow-bellied sapsucker.</p>
<p>As we approached a new covered bridge, one of 12 in the reserve, the
sapsucker flew ahead of us and onto a wooden pillar of the bridge.</p>
<p>In the still air, the rat-tat-tat of the sapsucker on the bridge sounded
abnormally loud, almost like the report of a gun.</p>
<p>When I asked why the bird was tapping at wood it knew wouldn't yield
sap, Duerksen shrugged, as if the answer was obvious.</p>
<p>&quot;It's mating season,&quot; she said. &quot;It makes a cool sound.&quot;</p>
<h3>Starting and stopping</h3>
<p>A bird hike is a good excuse to get into the woods and inhale the
ambrosia of spring air, heavy with the fragrance of damp earth and
growing things. But don't count on getting a lot of exercise.</p>
<p>&quot;I try to take a walk every day, but on a great warbler day, it takes
45 minutes to get down the driveway,&quot; Duerksen says. &quot;There goes the
aerobic value of a walk, but that's OK.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>As birds start to migrate and become more active, naturalists will hold
hikes all over the region, helping beginning as well as experienced
birders spot birds and identify their calls.</p>
<p>In the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge in the Twin Cities,
volunteer interpreter Craig Mandel leads bird-watching treks, each time
to a different part of the refuge.</p>
<p>In mid-April, he says, hikers will see sparrows and perhaps osprey,
peregrine falcons and great blue herons. In early May, they'll spot
shorebirds, the first warblers and, perhaps, trumpeter swans; later,
nesting birds will join the mix.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not any bird not worth looking at,&quot; says Mandel, who leads
50 to 70 field trips a year.</p>
<p>He has been birding seriously since 1985 and taught himself by listening
to bird calls on tape, over and over, just as if he were learning a
foreign language.</p>
<p>Every winter, he listens to the tapes again to brush up. Amateurs
shouldn't feel bad if they don't catch on right away, he says.</p>
<p>&quot;For me, it was a real struggle,&quot; he says. &quot;It's a lot of work.
You'll never learn it all, which is one thing I kind of like about
it.&quot;</p>
<p>The payoff comes in spring, when the symphony starts anew, and he's
there to listen.</p>
<p>&quot;Every month should be May,&quot; Mandel says. &quot;The birds, the flowers —
it's just great.&quot;</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Bird hikes</h3>
<p>Most hikes go out rain or shine; an overcast or even drizzly day often
is better than a warm, sunny day for spotting birds.</p>
<p>Dress for the weather and wear sturdy shoes. Bring binoculars and a
field guide. Often, centers lend binoculars and/or guides to
participants on hikes; call ahead to check.</p>
<p>Below are some of the places that offer hikes; check nearby state parks,
wildlife refuges and nature centers for others.</p>
