<h2>In winter, eagle-watchers and snowshoers can explore frozen Mississippi byways.</h2>

<p>For people who love nature, winter is a time of opportunity.</p>
<p>When it's cold enough, you can walk onto the Mississippi River. You can
see bald eagles up close. You can explore sloughs and backwaters without
being eaten alive by insects.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of these places, you'd almost die in a few minutes in summer,&quot;
says Scott Mehus, education specialist at the National Eagle Center in
Wabasha. &quot;So now is a good time to get out there and see things.&quot;</p>
<p>Until temperatures drop, bald eagles are spread out, fishing in streams
and snacking in the stubble of farm fields. But when snow covers fields
and rivers ice over, eagles have to congregate around dams and the
mouths of big rivers, where the water is open.</p>
<p>That makes them easy to find.</p>
<p>My first stop on a trip down the river one February was Reads Landing,
and the minute we turned off the highway, we saw a bald eagle in flight.
There were four of them, searching for fish in open water at the mouth
of Wisconsin's Chippewa River.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>That's instant gratification as far as eagle-watching goes. They were
easy to see, flying to and from a tree just overhead, and we could watch
from the warmth of the car.</p>
<p>In Wabasha, we looked for eagles along the river, near the  National
Eagle Center. Volunteers staff the city's observation deck on winter
weekends, often instructing visitors to look for &quot;blobs&quot; in the
cottonwoods across the river, but the bar had been raised; we wanted to
see eagles right in front of us.</p>
<p>We found them across the river in Alma, where five eagles were working
the pool beneath Lock and Dam No. 4. Up to 100 eagles congregate here in
winter, sitting on ice floes while they watch for shad coming over the
dam.</p>
<p>Eagles supposedly are lazy, but these were working hard, flying back and
forth over the open water in search of fish. We couldn't watch from the
car, but a walkway crosses the train tracks to a small observation deck
over the lock, and from there, the eagles were easy to watch.</p>
<p>From the mouth of the Chippewa, the Mississippi becomes a tangle of
sloughs and islands, part of the 260-mile-long Upper Mississippi River
National Wildlife and Fish Refuge.</p>
<p>Tiffany Bottoms Wildlife Area near Nelson is a good place to snowshoe or
hike, and Mehus recommends Winona's Aghaming Park, a strip of
bottomlands across the river's North Channel from Latsch Island.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/e/seven_bridges_trempealeau.jpg" alt="Seven bridges road hiking path in winter" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The sloughs are quiet in winter, except for the hollow tapping of
woodpeckers. People also will hear chickadees and nuthatches, and
perhaps see a red-shouldered hawk or coyote. And at winter's end, some
people like to look for shed deer antlers.</p>
<p>&quot;It's part of my excuse for getting out in the woods,&quot; says Pat
Manthey, avian ecologist for Wisconsin's DNR in La Crosse. &quot;Look for
deer trails, or places where they've bedded down or had to jump over
something. It might be where they were browsing on a tree or something
succulent — sometimes the antlers get tangled.&quot;</p>
<p>We took a lazy man's slough hike, on Seven Bridges Road in Van Loon
Wildlife Area, near Trempealeau. Built on a raised bed through
floodplain forest, the road once led to the settlement of McGilvray's
Ferry, which also was the name of the business that Scottish immigrant
Alexander McGilvray built in the 1850s.</p>
<p>In 1892, a steel bridge across the Black River put the ferry out of
business, and in 1905, La Crosse County had five bowstring-arch truss
bridges built to replace rotting wood bridges.</p>
<p>Today, the river bridge is gone, but the five bowstring-arch bridges
remain. Their graceful strands of forged steel, held not by bolts but by
loops welded to bars, are rare now, and all five bridges are listed on
the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>Along with a 1921 truss bridge brought in from Pierce County, they give
hikers an enchanting passage through a world from which all other signs
of civilization have vanished.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In summer, these marshes hum with life. In winter, everything's tucked
away, awaiting spring. Bird nests sat exposed and empty in bushes; I
picked a walnut-size gall off a bush, but the insect inside already had
exited through a pinhole.</p>
<p>We didn't see a living thing, until a bald eagle dropped out of a tree
right in front of us.</p>
<p>We looked for more eagles at Lock and Dam No. 6 in Trempealeau, and
along Black River Beach and Riverside Park in La Crosse, where dozens of
eagles had been hanging out before the cold snap. We spotted only one
patch of open water, and it was filled with ducks and geese.</p>
<p>But six eagles were fishing below Lock and Dam No. 8 in Genoa, not far
from a bunch of ice fishermen.</p>
<p>The open water was closer to the opposite shore, so we followed tracks
across the frozen river and, picking up a couple of mooneye shad the
fishermen had abandoned, stashed ourselves between two trees near the
eagles' roost.</p>
<p>The eagles would forget about us, we figured, and fly down to get the
fish when we threw it out. But these are birds who can spot food from a
mile away, and they could see us just fine.</p>
<p>They ignored us as well as the fish, but we still got to watch them as
they flew in circles around the dam.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There was a swan there, too, bobbing in water rushing through the dam's
roller grills, which stun fish and make them easy pickings for eagles.</p>
<p>We couldn't fault the eagles for wanting to take it easy — if we
hadn't been such slugs ourselves, we would have gotten up at daybreak
and seen 15 or 25 eagles breakfasting below the dam.</p>
<p>For us, though, even a few are a feast.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Winter rambles on the Mississippi</h3>
<p><em>Finding eagles:</em> For best viewing, get out just after dawn. In March,
bald eagles start migrating back to northern lakes along the
Mississippi flyway.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations:</em> The closer an inn is to the river, the closer it is to
train tracks. If you think the trains will bother you, bring ear plugs.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Red Wing</a> :
Colvill Park, on the south end of town off Minnesota 61, is a good place
to look.</p>
<p><em>Reads Landing:</em> It's off Minnesota 61, just north of Wabasha. Just
drive down to the river and watch.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
