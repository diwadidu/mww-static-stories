<h2>In southeast Minnesota, a live-wire named Alice inspired an annual festival.</h2>

<p>Like most women who take care of small creatures, Karla Bloem splits her
life into two parts: Before Alice and After Alice.</p>
<p>Before Alice, Bloem could sleep late and travel whenever she felt like
it.</p>
<p>But then little Alice came along. Alice wakes her up at the crack of
dawn, sulks if she leaves her and leaves messes all over the house.
Alice is a spoiled brat, Karla Bloem admits.</p>
<p>But she can't call Supernanny for help, because Alice is a great horned
owl.</p>
<p>When Alice was 3 weeks old, she was blown out of her nest in Antigo,
Wis., breaking her left wing at the joint and permanently damaging
nerves.</p>
<p>Marge Gibson, who runs a raptor rehabilitation center in Antigo, took
Alice in and then gave her to Bloem, who was looking for an injured bird
to feature at the Houston Nature Center.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Fortunately, Alice wasn't afraid of humans,&quot; said Bloem. &quot;When
Marge came, she ran straight toward her as if to say, 'Here I am, help
me.' So Marge knew she'd be a good education bird.&quot;</p>
<p>She's been an education for Bloem, that's for sure. Alice lived in an
outdoor pen at first but gradually worked her way into Bloem's house.</p>
<p>She thinks Bloem is her mate and, during mating season, expects to hoot
with her, nose to beak, for at least an hour a day.</p>
<p>She also wants her to play, never mind the sharp beak and eight talons,
and she likes to groom Bloem's face.</p>
<p>&quot;She thinks she's one of us, not an owl, but she still has all the
basic owl instincts,&quot; the naturalist says. &quot;Sometimes she looks at me
as if to say, 'Don't you get it?' I'm slowly learning.&quot;</p>
<p>Before she retired, Alice commuted to work at the nature center. She has
a lot of personality, and she was a big hit in the bluff-country hamlet
of Houston, known to bicycle tourists as the eastern trailhead of the
Root River State Trail.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>So when Alice turned 6, Bloem started the Festival of Owls to celebrate
her hatch-day.</p>
<p>Every year, the festival has gotten a little bigger, drawing an
irruption of owl-fanciers from around the nation. Now, Houston has an
International Owl Center in a storefront downtown, with Bloem as
director.</p>
<p>There are plenty of owls to see at the town's owl festival. The year I
went, it started with a talk by David Johnson, a native Minnesotan who
now is director of the Global Owl Project. He'd flown in from Virginia
to speak about owls in lore and culture.</p>
<p>&quot;They're a powerful bird,&quot; he said. &quot;In central Australia, owls are
considered Creator beings. The Dakota thought they had the power to cure
wounds. They're associated with shamans on Mayan ruins, and they're on
Greek coins from 600 B.C.&quot;</p>
<p>Then the first owl was inducted into the Owl Hall of Fame. It was Fat
Broad, the Oregon spotted owl who became the poster owl of the logging
controversy.</p>
<p>Eric Forsman, the U.S. Forest Service biologist who was her handler
until her death, teared up when he accepted her award.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;I had her for 32 years; I was 23 when I took her out of the nest,&quot; he
said. &quot;Fat Broad ate like a big pig and she was always overweight, so a
neighbor dubbed her for the character in the &quot;B.C.&quot; comic strip. She
was a great ambassador for her species.&quot;</p>
<p>Owls inspire many emotions in people. They're the only animals besides
primates that have flat faces with eyes in the middle, but they're not
particularly smart; their eyes and ears fill so much space there's not
much room for brain.</p>
<p>They're quite a piece of machinery, though.</p>
<p>Their head can swivel 270 degrees on a long and flexible neck, and a
great gray can hear a mouse when the mouse is buried under 18 inches of
snow.</p>
<p>A little rustle will reach its forward ear a split second before the
rear ear, allowing its brain to calculate when it should pounce.</p>
<p>They're also very good at eating what they catch, even if the prey is
half their size. Duluth ornithologist Laura Erickson has seen a great
horned eat a whole gray squirrel, ratcheting it down bit by bit, and a
4-ounce saw-whet down a mouse.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/houston_karla_hoosten.jpg" alt="Karla and Hooston." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Lisa Wadley</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>&quot;Its esophagus is stretchy like a balloon,&quot; she says. &quot;They have an
hourglass stomach. The mouse goes into the top part, the part with acid,
and that changes the mouse into mouse soup, with bones and teeth and
hair floating around like noodles. The gizzard squeezes out the good
soup part, and once a day the owl spits out a pellet with the rest.&quot;</p>
<p>Erickson led the festival's Saturday-morning dissection of owl pellets,
which Bloem likens to &quot;a box of Cracker Jacks; you don't know what
kind of prize you'll find in the bottom.&quot;</p>
<p>One woman found a cowbird skull in her pellet. I found only bits of vole
skeletons in my ball of compressed fur, though I could see that one of
them was a tiny thigh bone, nestled perfectly into a pelvic joint.</p>
<p>There's no point in being delicate about bodily functions where owls
are concerned. From the dissection, I went to see the video &quot;At Home
With Alice,&quot; in which Karla Bloem gives &quot;the Top 10 reasons you don't
want an owl for a pet.&quot;</p>
<p>They include &quot;an unending stream of poop&quot; and &quot;food preparation every
night of your life as long as you own an owl.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In Bloem's case, that means thawing and gutting a pocket-gopher carcass
to give to Alice, who then caches the leftovers around the house in
spots that Bloem sometimes doesn't find until they start to rot.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, there was an owl meet-and-greet hosted by Marge
Gibson.</p>
<p>We met Malcolm the barred owl, with no ear tufts but huge dark eyes —
&quot;if our eyes were that big, they'd be the size of grapefruits,&quot;
Gibson said — and Pepe Lulu the barn owl, with the white face that
often gets barn owls mistaken for a ghost.</p>
<p>There was Oscar the long-eared owl, and two Eastern screech owls, Watson
and Wookie, whose wide-open eyes under straight-up ear tufts gave them a
highly caffeinated look.</p>
<p>The tiniest owl was Little Bit the northern saw-whet, a fearsome
predator that looks like a cuddly ball of fluff.</p>
<p>&quot;Now we all say, 'Aww, cute,' &quot; Gibson told the crowd.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/houston_saw_whet_girl.jpg" alt="A saw whet owl with a girl." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the evening, everyone got onto buses and went on an owl prowl with
either Laura Erickson or raptor expert Mike Furr of Coon Valley, Wis.</p>
<p>&quot;They've both had owls land on their shoulders,&quot; Bloem says. &quot;If you
heard them in the woods, you wouldn't have any idea they're not an
owl.&quot;</p>
<p>In early March, many owls have just started breeding, so it's a good
time to try to call them in. The screech owl has a whinny that sounds a
little like a loon, and the saw-whet toots steadily, like a truck
backing up.</p>
<p>The long-eared owl sounds like a dog's &quot;woof,&quot; without the &quot;f,&quot; and
the barn owl shrieks like an angry cat.</p>
<p>It's the barred owl that makes the classic call &quot;who cooks for you.&quot;
But when Furr tried to call it in on our first stop, only a dog
responded.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a bark owl,&quot; he quipped.</p>
<p>We kept our eyes peeled because we weren't likely to hear the owls,
whose flight is silenced by special feathers that muffle the sound of
air rushing over the surface of the wing.</p>
<p>&quot;On one Elderhostel, I called and 17 minutes later, one answered 2 feet
over our heads,&quot; Furr said. &quot;Some people practically jumped out of
their skins; no one had heard it.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/houston_barred_owl.jpg" alt="A barred owl." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Malcolm the barred owl has huge eyes but no ear tufts.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On our next stop, a barred owl responded, but Furr suspected it was
Laura Erickson, calling on the other side of the Root River.</p>
<p>Finally, we went to Karla Bloem's farmhouse, because she said she often
hears the calls of screech and saw-whet owls in the woods.</p>
<p>But all we called in was a cow, which contributed a well-timed &quot;moo.&quot;</p>
<p>We could see Alice on her perch inside the house, regarding us as
regally as a queen.</p>
<p>&quot;She's so chock full of personality,&quot; Bloem says. &quot;I have no doubt
she's the most spoiled-rotten great horned owl in the world.&quot;</p>
