<h2>At an avian rest stop, humans learn about life on the wing.</h2>

<p>On a spring morning in east-central Wisconsin, two geese suddenly
shattered the stillness, honking urgently. Yellow warblers zoomed down
from trees and out of sight. Redwing blackbirds clung to cattails,
swaying in the stiffening wind.</p>
<p>It was only 6:30 a.m., but it was rush hour on the Horicon Marsh.</p>
<p>A human here feels oddly out of place, a lumbering interloper on a
fast-moving avian freeway. Birds own this marsh, and they aren't shy
about saying so, rending the air with trills and tweets as they go about
their business.</p>
<p>This marsh, often called the Everglades of the North, is an important
rest stop for migrating ducks, geese, warblers and other birds. It's
also the home of great blue herons, egrets, redhead ducks and more than
200 other species.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Amid its amber waves of cattails, stretching 14 miles from north to
south, hundreds of thousands of Canada geese and other birds stop to
refuel along their journey.</p>
<p>A century ago, nearby farmers tried to claim the marsh for themselves,
draining it and planting crops. But the wet, peaty depression, scoured
out by a lobe of the last glacier, was no good for farming, and the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service began to buy up the land.</p>
<p>Today, the 21,000 acres in the north is the Horicon National Wildlife
Refuge, and the 11,000 in the south is the Horicon Marsh State Wildlife
Area, administered by the Wisconsin DNR.</p>
<p>Both areas have hiking trails, observation decks and visitors centers. A
50-mile auto route girds the marsh, and the 34-mile Wild Goose State
Trail skirts its western edge.</p>
<p>From April to November, naturalists and local birders lead tours and
programs, delving into every aspect of the marsh's flora and fauna.</p>
<p>The biggest event of the year is the Horicon Marsh Bird Festival in
mid-May, which gives expert birders as well as novices a close look at
action in the marsh.</p>

warbler.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Starting at dawn, programs fly thick and fast — bus tours,
bird-banding demonstrations, boat tours, bird-call identification
classes.</p>
<p>During one festival, I headed into the marsh just as the sun rose over
its patchwork of islands and sloughs. Near the town of Horicon, the
wood-chip Horicon Habitat Trail heads into a forest and along the edge
of the marsh.</p>
<p>Birds are everywhere: large families of geese, bustling around a grassy
hillside; red-winged blackbirds; warblers; and great blue herons, whose
nesting colony on nearby Fourmile Island is the largest in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Circling back, I came upon a bird-banding demonstration led by DNR
naturalist Bill Volkert, who had gone out at 4:30 a.m. to stretch a fine
black net along a hedge of honeysuckle bushes.</p>
<p>The net had done its work, and now birds hung in mesh onion bags on a
clothesline, waiting to be banded.</p>
<p>But before he banded the birds, Volkert showed them to an intent cluster
of onlookers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;This guy has absolutely no fat,&quot; he said, blowing aside the
feathers on the belly of a northern water thrush. &quot;He's just burned up
all his fat, and his gas tank is on empty. If he's going to get up
north, he has to spend some time here.&quot;</p>
<p>A magnolia warbler, on the other hand, was downright chubby — its
belly was yellow with fat — and would leave as soon as the wind
shifted.</p>
<p>&quot;He came with the south wind a few weeks ago,&quot; Volkert said. &quot;These
birds unerringly come back to the same spot. Three years ago, I found a
yellow warbler I banded nine years ago, and she already was an adult
then. So she was 10 years old, flying 2,500 miles each way, and always
right to these bushes.&quot;</p>
<p>As he talked, bird calls rang out from the bushes.</p>
<p>&quot;Hear that 'reap-reap-reap' &quot;? he asked. &quot;That's a great crested
flycatcher. And that real sharp 's-s-s-s' — that's an American
redstart. I've been hearing Tennessee warblers all morning, and — ah</p>
<ul>
<li>there's a Blackburnian warbler.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>From the crowd, a woman's voice piped, &quot;Isn't that amazing? All I can
hear is a cardinal call and a mourning dove coo.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/horicon_marsh_boardwalk.jpg" alt="A floating boardwalk on Horicon Marsh." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For those who can't tell a sparrow from a swallow, the program was a
Cliff's Notes to birding.</p>
<p>As Volkert plucked birds from the net, we got close-up views of markings
many can see only in books - the fuchsia throat of a hummingbird, the
peach breast of a barn swallow and the greenish-yellow cap of a
chestnut-sided warbler,.</p>
<p>We also got two &quot;special surprises&quot; — a Lincoln's sparrow and a
bay-breasted warbler, both hard to find.</p>
<p>After the demonstration, I worked my way around the marsh
counterclockwise, driving deep into the marsh on the Dike Road, stopping
to look at exhibits at the Visitors Center and Marsh Haven Nature
Center, and hiking on the lovely trails off the Horicon TernPike, a
3.2-mile one-lane auto route in the northwest corner of the marsh.</p>
<p>The half-mile Egret Trail, partly a floating boardwalk, apparently was
the domain of purple martins, who were dive-bombing anyone who wanted to
walk on it.</p>
<p>Killdeer stood on mounds of mud, next to the zigzagging boardwalk, which
went through a gazebo and over a bridge before segueing into a forest
path lined with trillium and May apple.</p>

<p>The peaceful marsh is a respite for birds, but also for bird-watchers,
whose pastime is growing faster than any other in the United States.</p>
<p>One regular at the marsh is Mary Kay Duckstein, who lives in Chicago but
has a second home in nearby Green Lake and often drives down to take
pontoon-boat tours from Blue Heron Landing in Horicon.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very relaxing hobby,&quot; she said. &quot;You get up, you go out
and you watch. It stops you. It stops you from doing all the other crazy
things you do.&quot;</p>
