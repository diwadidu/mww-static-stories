<h2>Tundra-swan watchers have a honkin' good time during the November migration.</h2>

<p>In the sloughs of the Upper Mississippi, birds of a feather flock
together.</p>
<p>Bird-watchers, especially. On chilly days in late fall, they crowd onto
wooden platforms to watch tundra swans paddling around sloughs of the
Mississippi River.</p>
<p>This big bird needs a lot of fuel for its flight from the Arctic Circle
to the marshes of Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p>So when ponds in southern Canada and North Dakota start to ice over in
October, the swans fly down to feast on arrowhead tubers and wild celery
along the Mississippi before continuing east.</p>
<p>Once, as many as 6,000 tundra swans came to Rieck's Lake in Alma, Wis.
But river sediment filled the slough, accelerated by floods, and their
favorite tubers largely were replaced by burr reeds.</p>
<p>Now, many swan-watchers go to the Shady Maple Overlook in La Crosse and
the Brownsville Overlook in Minnesota, where naturalists from the Upper
Mississippi River National Wildlife Refuge help visitors spot birds on
weekends through the third week of November.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Wherever the swans are, photographers have a field day. When I arrived
in Alma one afternoon in November, Murnice Kuesel of nearby Arkansaw had
been out since 6:45 a.m. with his bazooka-sized lens, photographing and
watching the antics of more than 400 swans.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got the family thing, the mom and dad and kids,&quot; he said. &quot;A
while ago, there were a couple of kids who had their necks around each
other, fighting. Finally, the mom and dad had to swim over and break
them up. Typical.&quot;</p>
<p>Swans also create a ruckus if another family infringes on its feeding
area or a lone swan tries to join their family.</p>
<p>By 4:30 p.m., the swans were stirring, raising heads that had been
tucked under wings and calling to each other in long hoots. Suddenly,
there was a loud commotion, with wings flapping and necks pumping
furiously.</p>
<p>All was quiet for a minute, and then another quarrel flared nearby. Soon
raucous honking filled the valley and swans began to head for open
water, where they spend the night.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/l/alma_woman_binoculars.jpg" alt="A woman watches tundra swans." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The swans sounded like the world's biggest kazoo band when they returned
just after daybreak, in a cacophony of honks, clucks, trills and
squawks.</p>
<p>By 7:30 a.m., the sky was filled with swans coming in for a landing,
skidding on the water until they sank, long necks popping back up like
periscopes.</p>
<p>Murnice Kuesel already was on the platform and showed me K744, a swan
banded in 1992 and thought to have flown more than 100,000 miles in her
lifetime.</p>
<p>&quot;Did you hear that when they get a good tail wind, they can fly 100
miles an hour?&quot; he asked. &quot;One of the volunteers said one took off from
here and in a day or so was in Chesapeake Bay.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking through the scope, I spotted X079 and then H158, which volunteer
DD Starr of Buffalo City added to her chalked list when she arrived with
her husband, Bob.</p>
<p>&quot;Help yourselves to our scopes and see our gorgeous birds,&quot; she said. A
family of four flew toward us, circled and landed in a perfect line,
swimming side by side and turning into the channel in tight formation.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Look at that, two parents and two cygnets,&quot; Starr said. &quot;See, the
young ones have orange bills. I think it's remarkable: They're just born
around June, and they're making a 4,000-mile trip with their parents.&quot;</p>
<p>Red-tailed hawks, teals, shovelers, coots, canvasback ducks and muskrats
also frequent the marsh. Ron Laack of Plainview, Minn., had set up his
own scope and showed me two bald eagles sitting in a tree across the
lake.</p>
<p>In the tree behind the deck, he pointed out an oriole nest, hanging from
the top branch like a snood. Then he and Gary Krogman of Eau Claire,
Wis., passed around their photos; both men are photographers and who
also have worked with the National Eagle Center in Wabasha.</p>
<p>&quot;You want to show what you saw,&quot; Laack said.</p>
<p>Krogman came to Alma to photograph the swans and had been volunteering
on the deck ever since.</p>
<p>&quot;The best thing to see is a swan fall, when they come in ahead of a
front from North Dakota,&quot; he said. &quot;They swarm this whole area and just
drop in. They're like pearls up in the blue sky, strings and strings of
them. It's just an amazing thing; I've seen it twice in eight years.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/l/alma_main_street.jpg" alt="Main Street in Alma." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Alma's Main Street lies at the feet of the Mississippi bluffs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Bald eagles also are on the move in November, as well as pelicans and
hundreds of thousands of geese and ducks.</p>
<p>In October, the temperature starts to drop up north. On the ponds of
Saskatchewan and North Dakota, the swans eat and wait for a cold wind
from the northwest. When it starts to blow, they'll hop on board and let
it push them across the plains.</p>
<p>Next stop: the sloughs of the Mississippi.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Swan-watching around Alma, La Crosse and Brownsville</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> Alma (pronounced EL-ma by locals)Â  is an hour upriver
from La Crosse. Rieck's Lake is just north of town on I-35.</p>
<p>Shady Maple Overlook is on Wisconsin 35, one mile south of the entrance
to Goose Island County Park south of La Crosse. Refuge staff and
volunteers staff it from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. the first three weekends in
November.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wildlifeviewingareas.com/viewing-area/upper-mississippi-river-nwr-brownsville-overlook-iba/">Brownsville
Overlook</a>
is three miles south of Brownsville off Minnesota 26, 18 miles south of
La Crosse/La Crescent, Minn., not far from the Iowa border.</p>
<p>Volunteer naturalists staff it from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. the first three
weekends in November.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There are another two viewing decks in the seven miles between
Brownsville and Reno on Minnesota 26.</p>
<p><em>When to go:</em> The most activity is early in the morning and in late
afternoon, when the sun is setting behind the deck, producing beautiful
lighting for photographers, and the birds are flying overhead, heading
for the river bottoms.</p>
<p>Dress as warmly as possible; if you're taking photos, bring mittens or
gloves with open fingertips.</p>
<p>Rangers at the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Upper_Mississippi_River/">Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish
Refuge</a> post
recent wildlife
sightings.</p>
<p><em>Excursions:</em>  <a href="https://friendsoftherefugeheadwaters.org/swan-watch-2022/">The Friends of the Refuge</a> are offering the annual Tundra Swan Watch bus tour out of Winona on Nov. 15 in 2022. It's $35, including a box lunch.</p>
<p>The National Eagle Center in Wabasha offers
<a href="https://www.nationaleaglecenter.org/eagle-viewing/">swan- and eagle-watching field
trips</a>, $60.</p>
<p>On-board interpreters answer questions and provide binoculars and
spotting scopes. It's $30, including a box lunch.</p>
<p><em>Viewing:</em> For updates on the migration and advice about the best
places to see tundra swans and other birds, check the Fall Flight
Surveys issued weekly by the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife
and Fish Refuge.</p>
<p>For swans around Alma, call <a href="https://www.wingsoveralma.org/nature-center">Wings Over
Alma</a> at 608-685-3303.</p>
<p>There will be swans at Rieck's (pronounced Rick's) Lake, but viewing
may be better on the other side of Rieck's Lake: From Wisconsin 35,
just north of the slough, take County Road I to Badland Road and view
swans from there.</p>
<p>Or take Wisconsin 37 along the Buffalo River; the road passes several
sloughs, and many swans congregate at Tell Lake.</p>

Alma's Buena Vista Park has one of the best views of the Upper
Mississippi.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Eagle-watching:</em> Eagles migrate south along with swans, and Alma's
lock and dam and the observation deck at Wings Over Alma on Main Street
are good places to see them. Many eagles stay for the winter and can be
seen on the ice below the dam; at times, more than 100 at a time.</p>
<p>For more about eagle-watching in winter, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagle-watching/">Where eagles
land</a>.</p>
<p>For excursions around Alma, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/mississippi-winter/">Open sesame on the
sloughs</a>.</p>
<p>In Wabasha, the National Eagle Center is a natural stop for
bird-watchers. Three bald eagles and a golden eagle are in residence.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagles-wabasha-/">All eyes on Wabasha</a>.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations:</em> Light sleepers should avoid staying close to the rail
line, on which trains thunder by all night.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.hoteldevillealma.com/">Hotel de Ville</a> in Alma is on
Main Street and has five suites. Also on Main Street, the <a href="http://bluedoorinnalma.com/">Blue Door
Inn</a> offers suites and apartments in three
buildings.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.thetritschhouse.org/">Tritsch House B&amp;B</a> is closer to
the bluffs and has four rooms, three with doubleÂ  Jacuzzis, good for
warming up after early-morning bird-watching.</p>
<p><em>Dining:</em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pier4cafe/">Pier 4 Cafe &amp; Smokehouse</a>, overlooking the
lock and dam, is open for breakfast and lunch.</p>
