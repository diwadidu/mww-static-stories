<h2>Near Wisconsin Dells, a global village of birds lives, loves and thrives.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baraboo_whooper.jpg" alt="A whooping crane at the Crane Foundation." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Whooping cranes live at the sanctuary in an open marsh.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Wisconsin, the rarest birds in the world live not far from the Dells.</p>
<p>Not just any birds, but cranes - the tall, elegant birds of art and
myth.</p>
<p>In ancient Japan, cranes could grant wishes. In India, they're omens of
good fortune.</p>
<p>It's good fortune they survive at all, with their habitats shrinking
around the world. Near Baraboo, all 15 species live at the International
Crane Foundation, founded in 1973 by George Archibald and Ron Sauey on
Sauey's parents' horse farm.</p>
<p>The first thing visitors to this sanctuary notice is that, even though
the cranes live in pens, they rule the roost.</p>
<p>For birds, cranes have outsized personalities. They're loud, physical
and intense, often responding to visitors in startling ways.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>If you're not prepared, the piercing shriek of a sarus crane, the
tallest flying bird in the world at 6 feet, will make you jump out of
your shoes.</p>
<p>Red-crowned cranes growl, and many cranes stalk toward visitors with
their neck feathers flared like a cobra — threat behavior, used by
both males and females.</p>
<p>But they're not always so fierce. The last time I visited, we began at
the enclosure of a South African grey crowned crane, whose head feathers
actually are the color of corn tassels.</p>
<p>&quot;You can tell she's very happy,&quot; said our guide Bridget Amulike, who
had come from Tanzania to learn about the birds. &quot;Her golden crown is
very tall.&quot;</p>
<p>As if on cue, the crane jumped up in excitement and spread her wings.
With the red &quot;tie&quot; at her throat, she looked like a Japanese
watercolor come to life.</p>
<p>But this crane likes people too much, and her male mate not at all.
Result: no chicks.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baraboo_blue_crane_mural.jpg" alt="A blue crane at the Crane Foundation." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A mural is the backdrop for the blue cranes' pen.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;She likes people because that's what she saw when she hatched,&quot;
Bridget said.  &quot;So we can learn from these mistakes.&quot;</p>
<p>The Crane Foundation has used that lesson to help rebuild the population
of whooping cranes, which were hunted for food and feathers and had
dwindled to 22 by 1941.</p>
<p>Wearing crane costumes so chicks don't imprint on humans, its
biologists raised baby cranes and, in 2001, successfully trained them to
follow an ultralight to Florida, re-establishing the traditional winter
migration. They're still doing it every year, and the flock of wild
birds has grown.</p>
<p>But whoopers are a little too much like humans in another way: If they
don't like their mates, they won't produce eggs.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;There are 600 now, but 600 birds is not enough,&quot; Bridget said.
&quot;They're still very, very endangered.&quot;</p>
<p>We moved on to the blue crane from South Africa and the black crowned
crane from West Africa, where they are domesticated and also killed for
use in medicine.</p>
<p>Demoiselle cranes are native to the steppes of Russia, but received
their name from Marie Antoinette when they were brought to France.
They're the smallest cranes, only 3 feet tall and four to seven
pounds.</p>
<p>They're also the daintiest in appearance, with a pure-white fringe of
feathers around the backs of their heads.</p>
<p>Eurasian cranes are familiar to Europeans, who see them as they fly to
spend the winter in Spain and northern Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;If you have a swimming pool in Europe, you can expect a crane to come
use it, too,&quot; Bridget said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baraboo_sarus_crane.jpg" alt="A sarus crane at the Crane Foundation." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The sarus crane is the tallest flying bird in the world.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Sandhill cranes are most familiar to Midwesterers, who often hear their
loud, rattling calls and see them feeding in corn fields.</p>
<p>At the sanctuary, both the male and female were standing at the fence,
gazing intently at the visitors with their orange eyes; plexiglass
prevented contact from their long beaks.</p>
<p>Cranes can be scary. In her enclosure, a white-naped crane was bugling
more like an elephant than a bird, and Bridget translated: &quot;Get away,
get away, this is my territory.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's alone because the male is very aggressive,&quot; Bridget said. &quot;If
you pair him with a female, he usually attacks, and he even managed to
kill one female.&quot;</p>
<p>Red-crowned cranes are named not for red feathers, but for the blood
that rushes through the back of their heads when they're excited. The
pair we saw were indeed excited, thrusting their necks in the air, beaks
straight up, and spreading wings as they honked to the heavens.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>All cranes do unison calling, and they also dance, which is part of
courtship but also done to &quot;thwart aggression, relieve tension and
strengthen the pair bond.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a little more peaceful to watch the whooping cranes, who live in a
marsh, and the wattled cranes, who live in a low meadow that resembles
their African homeland.</p>
<p>After traveling around the world via crane — they live on every
continent except South America and Antarctica — visitors can wind down
by walking the sanctuary's serene nature trails.</p>
<p>They're loveliest in spring, when they're lined with wildflowers, and
in autumn, when the maples and oaks sport fall colors.</p>
