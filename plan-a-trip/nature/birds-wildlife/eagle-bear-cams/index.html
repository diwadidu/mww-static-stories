<p>In the northeast Iowa town of Decorah, two pairs of nesting bald eagles
have become an international phenomenon.</p>
<p>Not only do they have a constant stream of live video, but avid watchers
are snatching the best episodes — capturing the many dramas that go on
in and around the nest — and posting them on Youtube for everyone to
enjoy.</p>
<p>The Raptor Resource Project has dubbed them Nestflix and posts links to
the highlights on its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Raptor-Resource-Project/103786266324668">Facebook
page</a>, along with regular and often entertaining updates and explanations.</p>
<p>In January, the eagles court and get the nest ready. In February, the
females lay eggs. About 35 days later, the eggs hatch, and in April and
May, viewers can watch the eaglets grow.</p>
<h3>Drama in Decorah</h3>
<p>In recent years, events have unspooled in episodes of what naturalists jokingly call &quot;As the Nest Turns.'' In 2021, Mom Decorah and DM2 confused everyone by
abandoning their web-cam nest for a new location, then returning for visits
and occasional renovations of the old nest. In February, they began
incubating eggs in the new nest but returned occasionally
to drive other eagles away from the old nest. In 2023, they're still using the new nest, out of view of cameras.</p>
<p>In 2020, the couple hatched three eaglets; the middle one, D35, died of
lead poisoning shortly before her first birthday.</p>
<p>Of five eggs laid in the two nests in 2019, one was crushed, one eaglet
died and the three remaining eaglets fell or jumped out of the nest,
dogged by biting black flies.</p>
<p>All were rehabilitated by SOAR, an avian care center in Manning, Iowa,
and in September, the eaglets known as D33 and DN9 were released.
<a href="https://soarraptors.org/patients/d32/">D32</a>, who broke his leg,
wasn't released until March 3, 2020.</p>
<p>The biggest drama at the <strong><a href="https://www.raptorresource.org/birdcams/decorah-eagles/">original Decorah
nest</a></strong> came in
2018. Mom Decorah's three eggs had hatched and all was going well until
April 18, when Dad Decorah, devoted father to 31 eaglets over the years,
disappeared and a UME, unidentified male eagle, began hanging around the
nest.</p>
<p>After a fruitless search — and an international uproar from concerned
viewers — experts in Decorah decided Dad was gone for good.</p>

In northeast Iowa, Mom and Dad Decorah became Internet superstars.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>That fall, a new suitor, dubbed UME2, came to the nest, and Mom accepted
him as her mate, so he became DM2, or Decorah Male 2. Read the whole
<a href="https://www.raptorresource.org/2019/01/06/19892/">story</a> here.</p>
<p>A second webcam focuses on a newer country nest called <a href="http://www.raptorresource.org/birdcams/decorah-north-nest/"><strong>Decorah
North</strong></a>,
where the  original eagles were known as Mr. and Mrs. North.</p>
<p>In 2021, DNF laid eggs on Feb. 16 and 19, and they hatched in March.</p>
<p>In 2020, she laid two eggs, one of which died shortly after hatch. DNF
is Mr. North's second mate; after a disastrous  2018 nesting season, he
returned to the nest with a new female, dubbed DNF for Decorah North
Female.</p>
<p>The season had been hard for viewers to watch, with a first egg
collapsing and a second, late laying producing two eaglets who died of a
black-fly strike in their first week.</p>
<h3>Interlopers in Minnesota</h3>
<p>There's also a <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/features/webcams/eaglecam/index.html"><strong>Minnesota DNR web
cam</strong></a>
on a bald-eagle nest in St. Paul. A banded female had produced three
eggs a year since 2013, usually laying in mid-February.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In early 2019, a new pair kicked her and her mate off the nest and took
it over. But despite acting like lovebirds and rarely leaving each
other's company, the two didn't produce eggs.</p>
<p>In 2020, however, the female laid three eggs the second week of
February. All hatched, but the youngest died, likely due to lack of
food. And that summer, another of the eaglets hit a power line and died.</p>
<p>In 2021, the female returned with a new, younger mate. In mid-February,
she laid two eggs, and they hatched.</p>
<p>In 2022, the male disappeared from the nest, possibly a victim of bird flu. In the summer, another male appeared and seemed to be accepted by the female.</p>
<p>The DNR shares updates and details on its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MinnesotaNongameWildlifeProgram">Facebook
page</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/227557260721558/">Friends of Minnesota Nongame Eagle
Cam</a> Facebook group,
whose members share screen captures and comment on the eagles, whom they
have named Sid and Nancy.</p>
<h3>The Trio Nest in Illinois</h3>
<p>On the stretch of the Mississippi River between Fulton and Savanna,
Ill., the <a href="http://stewardsumrr.org/webcams/">Stewards of the Upper Mississippi River
Refuge</a> have installed webcams in
several locations.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/a/eagle_trio.jpg" alt="Starr, Valor I and Valor II on the nest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Stewards of UMRR</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Valor I, Valor II and Starr on the Trio Nest.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>One is on an unusual <a href="http://stewardsumrr.org/webcams/bald-eagle-nest/"><strong>bald-eagle
nest</strong></a> near Lock and
Dam 13. The first pair, Hope and Valor, tried to raise eaglets. However,
Valor was <a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/a-rare-bald-eagle-trio-two-dads-and-mom-captivates-webcam-fans">not the greatest
dad</a>, and when another eagle showed up, Hope accepted him as her main mate,
and Valor didn't seem to mind.</p>
<p>Hope, Valor I and Valor II successfully raised eaglets, with Valor I
eventually getting the hang of parenting.</p>
<p>In March 2017, however, Hope disappeared from the nest while fending off
an attack from two other eagles and is presumed dead. The two Valors
successfully raised two chicks while defending the nest from subsequent
attacks.</p>
<p>In late fall, a new, young female appeared on the nest with the Valors.
She was named Starr, and she has laid eggs every subsequent year and successfully raised eaglets with the Valors.</p>
<p>The two Valors are dutiful parents — sometimes even bickering over who
gets to sit on the eggs — and their home is known as the Trio Nest.</p>
<p>In August 2020, however, derecho winds blew the nest down. The trio
built a new one nearby, and web-cam viewers can observe from a distance.
The Stewards' <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stewardsoftheuppermississippiriverrefuge/">Facebook
page</a>
includes entertaining updates and observations.</p>

<h3>Falcon nests</h3>
<p>Another camera is in the <a href="https://www.raptorresource.org/birdcams/gsb-falcons/">Great Spirit Bluff peregrine falcon nest
box</a> high above
the Mississippi near La Crescent, Minn. It was occupied by Newman and
Michelle for many years, producing at least 22 young, but in 2020,
Michelle failed to return to the nest in late February, as usual.</p>
<p>She was replaced by a female now named Nova. Peregrine falcons lay eggs
between late March and mid-April, and the eggs hatch in the first half
of May. In 2020, a great horned owl snatched both chicks, first the
month-old Floyd, then his sister Elise.</p>
<p>In 2021 and 2022, a falcon named Zooey won Newman's heart, and the two tended
three eggs.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Nongame Wildlife Program also has a webcam on a pair of
<a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/features/webcams/falconcam/index.html">nesting peregrine
falcons</a>.</p>
<p>In the northern Chicago suburb of Evanston, there's a webcam on a
<a href="http://www.epl.org/falconcam/">peregrine falcon nesting box</a> on the
Evanston Public Library. However, Nona and Squawker left the nest in
2017 and have not returned.</p>
<p>For five years, Pebbles and Bam Bam successfully raised young at a
<a href="http://stewardsumrr.org/webcams/falcon-nest/">peregrine falcon nest
box</a> on the Consolidated
Grain Elevator in Savanna. However, in 2015, Bam Bam failed to return.</p>
<h3>Larger animals</h3>
<p>In the northern Minnesota town of Ely, the <a href="http://www.bear.org/website/">North American Bear
Center</a> has <a href="https://bear.org/watch-us-live/live-cams/">web
cams</a> in the dens of its
resident bears, Ted, Lucky and Holly.</p>
<p>Also in Ely, you can watch the resident
<a href="https://wolf.org/meet-our-wolves/wolf-cams2/">wolves</a> at the International Wolf
Center.</p>
<p>On Isle Royale in Lake Superior, Rolf Peterson and John Vucetich have
posted fascinating journal entries and amazing photos from their
long-running <a href="http://www.isleroyalewolf.org/winter-study">Winter Study</a>
of the island's wolves and moose.</p>
