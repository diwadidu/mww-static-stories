<h2>On Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a big state park is a playground for waterfall-lovers.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/a/tahquamenon_play.jpg" alt="Playing in the Lower Falls." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Visitors play in the Lower Falls.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At most waterfalls, people mainly sit, look and take pictures.</p>
<p>Not at Tahquamenon Falls.</p>
<p>Here, people duck under the falls, wade through them, row out to them
and hike between them on a five-mile riverside path that's part of the
North Country National Scenic Trail.</p>
<p>The waterfalls are the big attraction in Michigan's second-largest
state park, on the eastern end of the Upper Peninsula. Even more novel
is the park's brewpub, a popular stop for tourists on the Circle Tour
of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>The Upper Falls are biggest and most powerful, 200 feet wide with a drop
of 50 feet. During the spring log drive over the falls, wrote a
19th-century lumberman, &quot;we would see timber 2 feet square being broken
like matchsticks.&quot;</p>
<p>But the much smaller Lower Falls, 4 miles downriver, are the bigger
draw.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>People of all ages swarm to the Lower Falls area, which is next to the
campgrounds and features a whole series of waterfalls where the
Tahquamenon River splits around a small island.</p>
<p>A park concession rents wide, sturdy rowboats for the short trip to the
island. Once there, children and their parents jump from rock to rock in
shallow water. They use a bleached driftwood log like a balance beam.
They build artistic rock cairns at the feet of falls.</p>
<p>And they walk right under the falls, letting the water pound their
shoulders like fancy hydrotherapy.</p>
<p>We arrived at the park just before dusk on a Friday in August, taking a
quick peek at the Upper Falls before setting up our tent in the
well-kept campground, which was full. Kids rode their bikes, adults sat
quietly around fires, and by 10 p.m., all was quiet.</p>
<p>In the morning, I drove to the Upper Falls and headed back to the
campground on the 4½-mile River Trail, and my husband hiked from the
opposite end. Filmy cobwebs had covered the trail overnight, and the
river seemed asleep, so calm that it reflected the blue sky.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/a/tahquamenon_river_trail.jpg" alt="Hiking the River Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Boardwalks keep the River Trail close to the river.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The trail passed through a forest of cedar and hemlock but stayed close
to the river. We met in the middle, near a boardwalk surrounded by pink
Joe Pye weed, which, unlike hikers, enjoys wet feet.</p>
<p>Then the river seemed to wake up, and the delicious fragrance of
well-aerated water filled the air. The current turned murky, and I could
hear a dull roar in the distance.</p>
<p>A family ran past along the trail, and I saw two little girls in
swimsuits wading near the banks. On an observation deck, people were
snapping photos.</p>
<p>This is the Lower Falls, nature's water park. We hadn't realized how
close our campsite was to it — or to the gift shop's snack counter,
which sells cinnamon rolls, bagels, espresso drinks and other treats.</p>
<p>Camping is pretty cushy in Tahquamenon Falls State Park, and even more
so for those who rent the park's guest lodge or camper cabin.</p>
<p>For lunch, we went back to the Upper Falls, where a folk musician was
playing on the large pavilion and deck outside the Tahquamenon Falls
Brewery &amp; Pub Restaurant.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The brewpub began serving tourists in 1950 as a replica of a
logging-camp dining hall, and in the 1990s, the founders' grandchildren
updated it for modern tastes.</p>
<p>I would have liked a cold glass of Porcupine Pale Ale or Lumberjack
Lager, but I wanted to bask outdoors in the warm sun even more.</p>
<p>So instead, we got pulled-pork sandwiches from Big Falls Snacks, then
soft-serve twist cones that we ate in the white rocking chairs that line
the sides of the pavilion.</p>
<p>In autumn, campers come for the hiking and fall color. In late
September, shuttles on the River Trail are free for Hike Between Da
Falls, and in early October, there's a Harvest Festival in the
campgrounds, with hay rides and trick-or-treating.</p>
<p>In winter, there's snowshoeing and lantern-lit cross-country skiing,
and one campground as well as the brewpub stays open.</p>
<p>Tahquamenon Falls is remote, surrounded by wilderness and far from big
cities. But visitors find many reasons to make their way there.</p>
