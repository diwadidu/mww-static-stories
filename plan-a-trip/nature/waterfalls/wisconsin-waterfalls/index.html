<h2>Roaring cascades are remnants of the last Ice Age.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gurney_potato_falls.jpg" alt="Potato River Falls near Hurley, Wis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Gurney, Potato River Falls spreads out.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Deep in the forests of Wisconsin, and Potato River Falls was nowhere to
be found.</p>
<p>A sign pointed to an observation deck, from which I glimpsed a
bridal-veil falls in the distance. But the path down the Potato River
led only to a cobblestone beach.</p>
<p>Finally, I left the path to climb down a steep hillside, slippery with
clay and choked with the roots of spruce trees that flecked my hands
with sap.</p>
<p>Aha!</p>
<p>Spread out around me were a whole series of falls: A silky white ribbon
slipping down a basalt bowl. Water cascading down a field of potholes.
The two tiers of the main waterfall, spreading out from a bottleneck
like a bouquet of Queen Anne's lace.</p>
<p>The waterfalls of northern Wisconsin don't always deliver themselves on
a silver platter. But they reward those who take the trouble to find
them.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In spring, they look their best, crashing down in a froth streaked with
gold from the tannins in rotting tamarack leaves. In early summer, the
falls run clear, and by late summer, some are a creamy green, tinted by
algae clinging to rock.</p>
<p>Colors and moods change in the northern Wisconsin forest, too. By
mid-May, trilliums blanket the forest floor, as abundant as dandelions,
and spotted fawns emerge from their mothers' care.</p>
<p>By June, pink and blue lupines will be everywhere, and watchful hikers
may spot an osprey or bald eagle in the sky.</p>
<p>By late summer, waterfalls are thinner but easier to explore. When I
went to see Potato River Falls one September, I was able to pick my way
to the top of the tallest falls, over a riverbed of volcanic oddities.</p>
<p>In one stretch, the hard rock lay in red, pink and gray shingles, as if
a giant grader had just tried to level it; in another, upended shafts of
black slate formed the riverbed, with fingernail-size pieces crumbling
off their ends.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/m/amnicon_covered_bridge.jpg" alt="Covered bridge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A covered bridge spans the Amnicon River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Two billion years ago, this rock was lava, welling from splits in the
Earth's crust. The sheets of lava were so heavy they sagged in the
middle, and their edges sloped upward.</p>
<p>This basin later was covered by a red ocean, and sand sank to its floor.
During the last Ice Age, Glacial Lake Duluth filled the basin that would
become Lake Superior.</p>
<p>When the glacier melted, the overflow created rivers that sliced through
the soft sandstone on the basin's edge until they came to the hard lava.</p>
<p>The rivers kept flowing, but the lava refused to erode — and it's
still holding up the waterfalls today.</p>
<p>Douglas, Ashland and Iron counties, which border Lake Superior's south
shore, contain Wisconsin's nine largest waterfalls.</p>
<h3><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/pattison/">Pattison State Park</a></h3>
<p>Big Manitou Falls, 15 miles south of Superior in Pattison State Park, is
Wisconsin's highest falls at 165 feet, and the fourth-highest east of
the Rockies.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Visitors can stand at its head and gaze north over the treetops, to the
spot where the big glacier once hunkered on the horizon. But it's a
little hard to get a good view of the falls, which drop into a narrow,
heavily wooded gorge.</p>
<p>It's easier to enjoy Little Manitou Falls. You can drive there on
Wisconsin 35 or hike from the main part of the park. A trail leads a
mile past Interfalls Lake and along the Black River to the twin
cascades, which drop 31 feet into a round pool.</p>
<h3><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/amnicon/">Amnicon Falls State Park</a></h3>
<p>This delightful little park is just off U.S. 2, 17 miles east of
Pattison State Park.</p>
<p>There, the Amnicon River splits around an island and creates a series
of waterfalls connected by cascades. A picturesque covered bridge
divides Upper Falls and Lower Falls.</p>
<p>Take half a day to explore the island's various nooks and crannies,
which kids in particular love, and to picnic on one of the many tables
placed in clearings carpeted with pine needles.</p>
<p>Campsites also occupy attractive clearings along a quiet lane.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/m/amnicon_falls.jpg" alt="A waterfall in Amnicon Falls State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A couple play at the foot of Upper Falls in Amnicon Falls State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/copperfalls/">Copper Falls State Park</a></h3>
<p>To the east, this park is the home of 40-foot Copper Falls, where the
horehound-colored waters of the Bad River fall in twin torrents, and
30-foot Brownstone Falls, where Tyler's Forks Creek plunges over a
black-granite bed into the Bad River's gorge.</p>
<p>The two streams then surge across the narrow waist of Devil's Gate,
where a buttress of &quot;peanut-brittle&quot; rock juts over the river — a
slab of rock studded with rounded boulders, upended by the Earth's
heavings.</p>
<p>Both falls can be seen on the 1.7-mile Doughboys' Nature Trail, of
which half a mile is accessible. The North Country National Scenic Trail
also stretches for more than four miles through the park.</p>
<h3>Waterfalls in the forest</h3>
<p>The other waterfalls of northern Wisconsin are a little harder to find.
<em>Morgan Falls</em> is 18 miles west of Copper Falls, along county and forest
roads.</p>
<p>Once you get to the Chequamegon National Forest parking lot, it's only
half a mile to the falls, a 80- to 100-foot flume that zigzags down from
one red-granite ledge to another in a forest clearing.</p>
<p>Hikers who continue another uphill mile along the trail will come to St.
Peter's Dome, a granite outcrop with a view across the top of Wisconsin.</p>
<p><a href="http://ironcountywi.com/?110010">Iron County</a>, which stretches from
just east of Copper Falls to Lake Superior and the Michigan border,
includes a dozen notable waterfalls.</p>
<p><em>Potato River Falls</em> , in a county park near Gurney, 12 miles northeast
of Copper Falls off Wisconsin 169, is not so hard to find, unlike nearby
Wren and Foster falls.</p>
<p>Eighteen-foot <em>Upson Falls</em> , just south of Whitecap Ski Area, is off
Wisconsin 77 in Upson Town Park.</p>
<p>Two of the tallest falls are just west of Hurley. <em>Superior Falls</em> is a
spectacular 90-footer on the Michigan borderat the mouth of the Montreal
River, a deep-sea harbor and the portal for early French explorers and
fur traders.</p>
<p><em>Saxon Falls</em> is a 78-footer farther up the Montreal; however, access is
from property owned by Xcel Energy, which operates dams on the river.</p>
<p>And there are many other falls in the area, such as Peterson and
Kimball, even closer to Hurley.</p>

In Pattison State Park, the twin cascades of Little Manitou Falls drop
31 feet.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>And there are dozens just across the Michigan border, including the wild
cascades on the Black River north of Bessemer (for more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/black-river-michigan/">Waterfalls
of the Black River</a> ) and in Porcupines
Mountains Wilderness State Park in the Upper Peninsula (for more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Afoot in the
Porkies</a> ).</p>
<p>More falls can be found to the south, tucked away in the wilderness of
Wisconsin's Florence and Marinette counties (for more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/marinette-waterfalls/">Waterfalls
of northeast Wisconsin</a> ).</p>
<p>In the spring they come alive, along with all the forest's flora and
fauna, and they make a good excuse to get out into the woods. Just bring
a good map and an adventuresome spirit.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Northern Wisconsin waterfalls</h3>
<p><em>Finding the falls</em> : It's easiest with a copy of Patrick Lisi's
&quot;Wisconsin Waterfalls: A Touring Guide&quot; ($19.95, available at the
Northern Great Lakes Visitor Center at the junction of U.S. 2 and
Wisconsin 13).</p>
<p>A DeLorme Wisconsin Atlas &amp; Gazetteer shows the littlest forest roads
and includes waterfall locations. It's available at larger bookstores
and sporting-goods stores.</p>
<p>The website <a href="http://gowaterfalling.com/">Great Lakes Waterfalls</a>
includes photos and descriptions of many waterfalls, including those
around <a href="http://gowaterfalling.com/waterfalls/maps/lakesuperior.shtml">Lake
Superior</a>.</p>
<p><em>State parks</em> : Amnicon, Pattison and Copper Falls all can be seen with
a daily pass, $8 for Wisconsin residents, $11 for non-residents ($5
for a one-hour pass).</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/m/amnicon_snakepit.jpg" alt="Snakepit Falls at Amnicon." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Amnicon's Snakepit Falls is one of many.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Morgan Falls</em> : It's 17 miles south of Ashland in Chequamegon-Nicolet
National Forest; from the west end of Main Street, take Sanborn
Avenue/Wisconsin 112 to County Road E and continue south.</p>
<p>At the county line, take the gravel Ashland-Bayfield Road 4½ miles south
to the trailhead parking lot.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/regions/eastern/StPetersDome/index.shtml">Morgan
Falls</a>
is a five-minute walk. <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/natural-attractions-and-parks/st-peters-dome-198649">St. Peter's
Dome</a>
is half an hour's hike uphill on rocky terrain.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : Ashland makes a good base for exploring waterfalls.
For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/ashland-wisconsin/">City on Chequamegon
Bay</a>.</p>
<p><em>Camping</em> : There's rustic camping at <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/amnicon/">Amnicon
Falls</a> and campsites with
showers at <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/pattison/">Pattison</a> and
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/copperfalls/">Copper Falls</a>, which
also has a cabin for people with physical disabilities.</p>
<p>On Lake Superior, between Ashland and Hurley, <a href="http://www.ironcountyforest.org/saxon-harbor.html">Saxon Harbor County
Park</a>  has camping as well as a sand beach for
swimming, showers, a protected bay for kayaking and a bar that serves
burgers and pizza.</p>
<p>Near Copper Falls, <a href="http://www.highbridgehillssports.com/">Highbridge Hills Sports
Complex</a> has campsites with
showers and a bunkhouse.</p>
