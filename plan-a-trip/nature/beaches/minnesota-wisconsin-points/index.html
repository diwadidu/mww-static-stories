<h2>On Lake Superior, a windswept spit of sand draws beach bums and boat nerds.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_skyline_view.jpg" alt="The view from Duluth's Skyline Parkway." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 10-mile sandbar creates Duluth-Superior Harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Most people don't think of Duluth as a beach town.</p>
<p>It's a little chilly, for one thing. But the port city has six miles of
sandy beach along the largest freshwater sandbar in the world.</p>
<p>Just over the Aerial Lift Bridge, Park Point is where Duluthians play.
They hike and run on a two-mile trail through forest and dunes. They
paddle canoes and kayaks. They hang out on the beach, watching waves in
winter and braving them in summer.</p>
<p>And there's up-close boat-watching on both ends.</p>
<p>Technically, Park Point is an island. Before 1870, the only entry was on
the Wisconsin side. Then the people of Duluth dug their own, completing
it just before the city of Superior served a federal injunction to stop
it.</p>
<p>It was reached first by ferry, then by gondola cars suspended from a
raised bridge. In 1930, the lift bridge became Duluth's best-known
landmark.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Now, you just clatter over the rising deck of the bridge to get there.</p>
<p>The Lake Superior side of the point is lined by beach cottages, several
of which can be rented. There's a city beach pavilion with restrooms,
sports fields and a playground.</p>
<p>The road ends at Sky Harbor Airport, beyond which the Park Point Trail
leads hikers to the Superior entry.</p>
<p>There's a lighthouse on the Wisconsin side of the entry. It's used
mainly by leisure boats and freighters heading for the Burlington
Northern ore terminal.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the narrower Wisconsin Point stretches another three miles
along Allouez Bay, its Lake Superior side lined by woods and secluded
beaches.</p>
<h3>Hiking the point</h3>
<p>I didn't start to discover the wilder parts of the two points until I
first hiked the Park Point Trail.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_park_point_ruin.jpg" alt="Lighthouse ruins on Duluth's Park Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Park Point Trail passes the ruins of an 1855 lighthouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Nearly every step brought a revelation — a hushed thicket of
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/sna02000/index.html">old-growth pines,</a>
the stepped gables of an old Coast Guard supply station, sand dunes
covered with wildflowers, the curving breakwall around a cove stacked
with driftwood.</p>
<p>The brick ruins of Lake Superior's first lighthouse are here, too.
Built in 1858, the lighthouse was tended through its 20-year life by
keeper R.H. Barrett, who used his own lungs to blow a foghorn that
locals dubbed &quot;Barrett's Cow.&quot;</p>
<p>I didn't notice the clumps of poison ivy everywhere, however, until
other hikers happened to mention it.</p>
<p>I've been there often since. There's nowhere like it — a quiet, wild
oasis surrounded by industry, where the sawing of crickets mixes with
the grunt of cranes in Superior Harbor.</p>
<p>The 360-degree panorama includes the endless horizon of the lake, the
crowded hillsides of Duluth and the hulking Burlington Northern ore
terminals, last stop for the Edmund Fitzgerald in 1975.</p>
<p>Once, I brought my kids, who &quot;snowboarded&quot; down a sand dune on their
feet and played on a beach covered with bleached driftwood. I'm still
discovering new stuff, most recently a shack made of washed-up logs.</p>
<h3>On the Wisconsin side</h3>
<p>One August, I discovered <a href="http://www.ci.superior.wi.us/index.aspx?NID=226">Wisconsin
Point</a> after bicycling
along the paved Osaugie Trail from Barker's Island in Superior one
evening. Returning to its end point in my car, I continued on a 25 mph
blacktop road that led to the wooded point.</p>
<p>Bumping along in the gathering dusk, I passed many pullouts, from which
paths led to beaches, and through a corridor of old-growth pines to the
harbor entry.</p>
<p>The lighthouse beacon was flashing, and the lights of Duluth twinkled in
the distance.</p>
<p>At the tip of the point, a dozen young people already were sitting
around a bonfire. Both points attract drinking parties, and secluded
Wisconsin Point is known for having fewer police patrols than Park
Point.</p>

Park Point beaches have views of Duluth and approaching boat traffic.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A band of Ojibwe lived on Wisconsin Point until 1914, when they lost
their land to the government and railroad. However, in 2011, the
Department of Interior ordered the return of 14 acres at the tip of the
point.</p>
<h3>A dip in Superior</h3>
<p>The next day was a hot one, so I did something I've always wanted to do
in Duluth: swim in Lake Superior. People need some gumption for that;
despite the inviting beaches of Park Point, this is no ordinary lake.</p>
<p>Its temperature swings only a few degrees on either side of 40
year-round, unless a northeast wind blows a layer of warmer water onto
its surface, in which case swimming can be tolerable.</p>
<p>This wasn't one of those days, however, so I just plunged in, swam a few
yards and swam back, pausing in knee-deep water to have my photo taken
for proof.</p>
<p>&quot;You did it like a Duluthian, I'm proud of you,&quot; said Maryan Kang,
who was at the beach with her son Elliot. Kang, who has lived in Duluth
for five years, said she moved from Maple Grove because she wanted to
live where she vacationed.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_ed_kayaking.jpg" alt="A kayaker paddles off Duluth's Park Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;When I first moved here, I was used to waiting to swim until it got
really hot,&quot; she said. &quot;Then I got acclimated and realized this is as
hot as it gets. If you wait until it's really hot, you'll end up with
no swimming days at all.&quot;</p>
<p>On the bay side, however, the water is warm. The same weekend, I rented
a kayak to explore the harbor.</p>
<p>Unlike the lake, where waves can top 6 feet in a flash and hypothermia
can kill capsized kayakers, the harbor is safe if kayakers stay out of
shipping lanes.</p>
<p>Paddling along, I saw the 690-foot Courtney Burton coming in, heading
for the grain terminals on Connor's Point, under the Blatnik Bridge. I
looked into the back yards of houses, most with a canoe or paddleboat
stowed away, and passed a wood duck trailing six ducklings.</p>
<p>Circling around a bird sanctuary,  I came upon a wave runner, a Vista
cruise boat and a spinnaker, sails billowing in the breeze.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/u/superior_entry_cort.jpg" alt="Freighter enters the Superior harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Watching the boats</h3>
<p>Boats, of course, are what Duluth-Superior Harbor is all about. I like
watching the really big ones.</p>
<p>I've stayed twice at the South Pier Inn on the canal, where guests have
decks that give them a view of boats coming and going.</p>
<p>One April, I didn't see any boats from the room, though I saw the James
R. Barker coming in from my table at JJ Astor Restaurant atop the
Radisson.</p>
<p>And at the end of a lovely hike on the Park Point Trail, I saw the
1,000-foot Stewart J. Cort coming in for a load of taconite.</p>
<p>I was luckier one September, when I splurged on a corner suite. From my
balcony, I could see the Utviken across the harbor, loading grain at the
AGP dock.</p>
<p>Then the air turned viscous, and wisps of cold air began to brush my
bare arms. A curtain of fog rolled in, and the foghorn started to growl.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At 3:30 p.m. bridge bells began to ring and I scanned the harbor vainly
until I spotted the Columbia Star emerging from the mist, loaded with
coal. Under the same conditions, the Fraser had grounded that summer,
despite an escort of two tugs and guidance from local captains.</p>
<p>With my room wrapped by fog, sounds became magnified: the rumble of car
tires on the grating of the bridge deck, the screech of gulls, the
monotone of the foghorn. But soon the fog began to burn off, and I set
off to hike the Park Point Trail.</p>
<p>The Burns Harbor was at the Burlington Northern docks, its pilot house
wrapped in twinkle lights, and by the time I reached the entry
lighthouse, it was bathed in sunbeams newly broken through clouds.</p>
<p>Walking back, I watched the white steeples of Superior and buildings of
Duluth pop out of fog.</p>
<p>Back at the South Pier Inn, I kept my ears cocked for bells, jumping up
only to see a sport-fishing boat go through at 6 a.m. and another at 7
a.m., along with the Environmental Protection Agency vessel Lake
Explorer, which docks on Park Point.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_park_point_dunes.jpg" alt="Dunes on Duluth's Park Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Iron-ore terminals line the opposite side of the bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At 8:30 a.m. the Oglebay Norton arrived, a big but ugly coal freighter
trailing plumes of black smoke. The older but sleeker Courtney Burton
left at 10:15, and at 10:30 the Canadian boat Tadoussac arrived for a
load of taconite.</p>
<p>I hung around till 11 a.m., when a green tug chugged through, but then I
had to turn over my fabulous Park Point lookout to another boat-watcher.</p>
<p>On a hunch, I drove over the Blatnik Bridge and over to Wisconsin Point,
where I lucked out: As I stood at the pier, face to the horizon, I saw
the Stewart J. Cort appear.</p>
<p>On the world's largest sandbar, boat sightings are guaranteed — though
never enough.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Minnesota Point and Wisconsin Point</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : To get to Minnesota Point/Park Point, just cross the
Aerial Lift Bridge.</p>
<p>To get to Wisconsin Point, take U.S. 2/53 to the edge of Superior, then
turn onto Moccasin Mike Road.</p>
<p>It's a nice bicycle ride from Barker's Island. Ride five miles along
the harbor on the paved Osaugie Trail to Moccasin Mike Road (speed limit
25 mph). It's another 4½ miles to the light station at the end of
Wisconsin Point.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_south_pier_inn.jpg" alt="South Pier Inn in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Guests at the South Pier Inn can catch boats coming and going.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Annual events</em> : Last weekend of June, <a href="http://www.parkpointartfair.org/">Park Point Art
Fair</a>, a juried show of 120 artists,
with music, food and family activities.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : There's a hotel, a B&amp;B and several cottages for rent
on Park Point. Rates are highest in summer.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.southpierinn.com/">South Pier Inn</a> is right on the
canal. Avid boat-watchers might want to splurge on the corner suites,
which have full views both of the harbor and Aerial Lift Bridge.</p>
<p>All waterfront suites have whirlpools, gas fireplaces and decks; reserve
the ones on the second floor, so people walking on the sidewalk in front
of the hotel can't look into your room.</p>
<p>A continental breakfast is included in the rates.</p>
<p>Just a few buildings away, <a href="http://www.solglimt.com/">Solglimt B&amp;B</a> is
on the Lake Superior side of Park Point. Proprietor Brian Grover grew up
on Park Point, and he and his wife, Mary, offer five luxurious rooms in
the 1910 house and an addition.</p>
<p>Four blocks from the lift bridge, the <a href="http://www.parkpointmarinainn.com/">Park Point Marina
Inn</a> on the bay has 68 rooms with
balconies. It has a pool and serves a hot breakfast buffet.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_park_point_trail_beach.jpg" alt="Duluth's Park Point Trail leads to the beach near the Superi" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Driftwood collects on the beach near the Superior Entry.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A block away, the <a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/dlhfw-fairfield-inn-and-suites-duluth-waterfront/">Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites by
Marriott</a>
also has a pool and includes a hot breakfast.</p>
<p>Vacation rentals include the comfortable <a href="http://www.cottageonthepoint.com/">Cottage on the
Point</a>, a three-bedroom late-1880s
house. It faces the street, but the owners live in the adjoining
lakefront house and allow access to the beach and use of kayaks.</p>
<p><em>Boat watching</em> : Check online for approximate <a href="https://harborlookout.com">arrival and
departure</a> times.</p>
<p>The free <a href="http://www.lsmma.com/">Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center</a>, next to the Aerial Lift Bridge on Canal Park, gives daily programs and
pier history walks in summer.</p>
<p><em>Hiking</em> : The Park Point Trail, four miles round-trip, starts at the
airport; park just outside it. Part of the trail is sand, requiring some
stamina; also, watch out for poison ivy.</p>
<p><em>Swimming</em> : The entire Lake Superior beach is public, but the <a href="http://www.duluthmn.gov/parks/parks-listing/park-point/">Park
Point Recreation
Area</a> beach,
with restrooms, starts off 43rd Street. In summer, lifeguards are on
duty unless red flags indicate the presence of rip currents, which make
swimming dangerous.</p>
<p>The water is warmer on the harbor side, but goose droppings can make
swimming unsanitary.</p>
<p><em>Bird-watching</em> : Minnesota Point is one of the longest freshwater
sandbars in the world, and migratory birds use its trees and beaches as
a resting point in spring and fall. Allouez Bay on Wisconsin Point also
is renowned for bird-watching.</p>
