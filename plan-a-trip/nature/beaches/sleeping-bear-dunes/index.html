<h2>Along Lake Michigan, the Sleeping Bear Dunes are a playground for all ages.</h2>

<p>One Great Lake east of Superior, there's another North Shore.</p>
<p>It doesn't have any craggy points or sheer palisades, and there are no
agates waiting to be found. It has no waterfalls, and not a scrap of
basalt; in fact, there's nothing volcanic about it.</p>
<p>But this north shore, on the leeward side of Lake Michigan, has
something Minnesota's beautiful North Shore on Lake Superior doesn't
have: Sand, lots and lots of sand.</p>
<p>In fact, it's nothing <em>but</em> a big,
squashy pile of sand, deposited by the last glacier and continually
whipped into new shapes by the same nor'westers that skip right over the
North Shore.</p>
<p>They cross the Upper Peninsula, pick up speed over Lake Michigan and
slap the northwest tip of lower Michigan along a coastline the Ojibwe
likened to a reclining bear, with two islands just offshore that
represent her cubs.</p>
<p>This coastline is Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, a 35-mile-long
playground lined with something else that's scarce on Lake Superior:
Swimming beaches.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Not only is this stretch lined with beautiful
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-lake-michigan/">beaches</a> — it's been
called &quot;America's hidden Riviera&quot; — but the Lake Michigan beaches
often are connected by sandbar to small inland lakes, giving swimmers a
choice of warm or cold water.</p>
<p>I came across this area, part of the world's longest stretch of
freshwater dunes, while driving around the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-tour/">top half of Lake
Michigan</a> and, another year, while making the
entire <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/circle-tour-lake-michigan/">Circle Tour</a>.</p>
<p>In many ways, this lake is Superior's friendlier sister, nearly devoid
of rocks and easing toward land over long, shallow beaches.</p>
<p>This congeniality doesn't extend to ships, however. The Manitou Passage,
the stretch between the national lakeshore and South Manitou and North
Manitou Island, holds hundreds of shipwrecks and now is an underwater
preserve.</p>
<p>Today, freighters still can be seen on the horizon, heading toward the
Straits of Mackinac. Ferries take day hikers and campers out to the two
islands.</p>
<p>They were created, according to Ojibwe legend, by two cubs that, with
their mother, fled a forest fire in Wisconsin but tired just short of
the Michigan shore and drowned as their mother waited atop a bluff.</p>
<p>Tourists fill the area in the summer, though many more gravitate to the
multiple attractions of <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Traverse
City</a>
and Petoskey.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/l/sleeping_bear_platte_girls.jpg" alt="Girls run into the Platte River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Sleeping Bear is for more outdoorsy types, people who think floating
down a river into Lake Michigan or climbing a 150-foot wall of sand is
the height of fun. For those who love sun, sand, sea and sweeping views,
this is the place.</p>
<p>We tried to take in the highlights of the area, and wherever we went, we
picked up hints about the best things to do. Here are enough of them to
fill most of a week.</p>
<h3>Float the Platte River</h3>
<p>We canoed from the highway to the river's mouth, and it was pleasant to
paddle through Loon Lake and along a twisting channel lined by clusters
of yellow flag. However, canoe rental and shuttle for the two-hour float
is way overpriced, considering it's only a 2½-mile drive to the take-out
point.</p>
<p>Next time, we'd bring our own tube or raft and float the mile from El
Dorado Landing to the last stretch of river, where the real fun is.</p>
<p>At Platte River Point, the river winds around a grassy picnic area at
the end of the Lake Michigan Road. Small dunes rise on the other side of
the shallow river, and small children love to run up the dunes and then
back down into the crystal-clear, warm water.</p>
<p>My children adored the river's mouth farther down, where they flirted
with cold tentacles of Lake Michigan water and spent hours skipping the
flat stones sprinkled on the sandy bottom.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Bird-watchers can look for the piping plover, an endangered shorebird
whose nearby nesting areas are protected by wire mesh.</p>
<p>When you're ready to go, simply walk the mile back to your car. If you
do canoe or kayak, go early or late in the day, when you're more likely
to see wildlife.</p>
<h3>Do the Dune Climb</h3>
<p>Everyone has to climb the 150-foot dune that seems to rise out of
nowhere on the west shore of Glen Lake, whose blue surface becomes part
of the lovely panorama people enjoy at the top.</p>
<p>Small children in particular love this climb — &quot;It's like the
desert!&quot; exclaimed the little boy climbing next to me — and so do big
children, once they get started.</p>
<p>&quot;It's so peaceful up here,&quot; said my daughter, who scampered up the dune
and planted herself like a little Buddha on a patch of dune grass. &quot;Now
I'm here, I don't want to leave.&quot;</p>
<p>Climbing is best early or late in the day, when slanting shadows make
the dune especially beautiful.</p>
<p>Wear shoes (the sand is hot) and bring water; climbing in sand takes
some effort. It's easiest just after a rain, when you can climb
barefoot.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/m/empire_dune_hike.jpg" alt="The Empire Bluff hike in Sleeping Bear Dunes." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Walk to Empire from the 450 Dune</h3>
<p>Hanging out at the Lake Michigan overlook off the 7½-mile Pierce
Stocking Scenic Drive, I ran into a group of teen-agers from a YMCA
camp. They were getting ready to descend the 450-foot dune, their young
leader told me, and spend the day playing along the lake and walking to
Empire.</p>
<p>Later, standing on the boardwalk of the Empire Bluff Trail and looking
north, I could clearly see the 450, the strip of sand at its feet and
the rooftops of Empire.</p>
<p>I realized what a fun day that would make if you had two cars: Play,
walk, wade and wind up with an ice-cream cone in Empire, a former
logging village named for a schooner that became icebound there in 1865.</p>
<p>Some people decide to run down the 450 Dune and then climb back. That's
a bad idea, especially for children. Both times I've been there, I've
seen exhausted families struggling to get back up the steep dune.</p>
<h3>Hike</h3>
<p>The Empire Bluff Trail is most popular; it's only 1½ miles round-trip
and leads to a boardwalk with a sweeping view of the lake and northern
dunes (to get to the trailhead, take Michigan 22 south of Empire 1.6
miles to Wilco Road, or follow Lake Street out of Empire, a canopied,
curving lane that leads straight to the trailhead).</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Of course, the park has many other trails, including the Cottonwood, a
1½-mile nature loop off Pierce Stocking drive; the two-mile loops of the
Old Indian Trail, west of the Platte River; and the 2½-mile Pyramid
Point Trail at the northern tip of the park.</p>
<h3>Swim in the sun</h3>
<p>Great beaches are everywhere, but some, such as the national park's Lake
Michigan/North Bar Lake beaches, are more fabulous than others.</p>
<p>On the &quot;ocean&quot; side it looks just like Florida without the condos, and
if sunbathers want to take a dip in warmer waters, they just cross a
little sandbar to swim in the Caribbean-blue North Bar Lake, ringed by
dunes and woods.</p>
<p>It doesn't have any amenities other than a latrine, however, and the
washboard roads leading to it are a pain (nearly two miles north of
Empire, turn left onto Voice Road, then right on Bar Road).</p>
<p>The Lake Michigan/South Bar Lake beach, a stone's throw from downtown
Empire, is a lot easier to get to, and the people-watching is great.</p>
<p>Besides big-lake and small-lake beaches, it has basketball and
volleyball courts, an old-fashioned playground and a picturesque little
lighthouse, a memorial to a local fisherman who always wanted a light to
guide him home.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/m/empire_beach_dog.jpg" alt="The beach of Empire, Mich." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The beach at Empire is gorgeous at sunset.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the Leelanau Peninsula, Leland has a gorgeous Lake Michigan beach
(turn left on Cedar, just before downtown), and on Grand Traverse Bay,
Northport has a nice municipal beach in the lee of the marina; this one
is especially good for smaller children.</p>
<h3>Explore the Leelanau Peninsula</h3>
<p>We spent one day driving around the Leelanau, which is not an Ojibwe or
Ottawa word but the invention of Henry Schoolcraft, the Indian
agent/scholar who also came up with Itasca. Considered the little finger
of the lower Michigan &quot;mitten,&quot; it forms the west shore of Grand
Traverse Bay.</p>
<p>It's undulating because of drumlins, oval hills filled with glacial
rubble, and covered with vineyards and cherry orchards.</p>
<p>On the Lake Michigan side, the island ferries leave from Leland's
Historic Fishtown, a collection of weathered gray fishing shanties that
now house T-shirt and candy shops.</p>
<p>Shops, cafés and shiny Mercedes fill the little downtown; we headed
instead for the Village Green, where we had a picnic in the shade of a
giant maple.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/l/sleeping_bear_dune_climb2.jpg" alt="The Dune Climb in Sleeping Bear Dunes." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Dune Climb, up a 150-foot dune on the shore of Glen Lake, is a park
favorite.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Farther on, Northport is less gentrified. Within two minutes, we spotted
a used-book store, an ice-cream parlor, a grocery and a beach — &quot;It's
the jackpot!&quot; said my son.</p>
<p>Later, on the way back from visiting Grand Traverse Lighthouse at the
tip of the peninsula, we stopped again in Northport and had root-beer
floats and blueberry pie.</p>
<h3>Visit the islands</h3>
<p>North Manitou is a wilderness area frequented by campers; there's no
ferry pickup until the next day once they're dropped off. South Manitou,
however, has an 1871 lighthouse, a grove of giant cedars, the visible
wreck of the Francisco Morazan and ranger talks that cover island
history.</p>
<p>The ferry service takes tourists to both islands. Call <a href="https://manitoutransit.com/">Manitou Island
Transit</a> at 231-256-9061.</p>
<h3>Watch the sun set</h3>
<p>There's nothing more pleasant than a stroll along Empire's beach late in
the day. When I was there, I stopped to chat with Grace Dickinson, who
grew up in the area while her parents ran the weekly Leelanau Enterprise
and told me a group of locals comes every night to sit on a driftwood
log and watch the sun set.</p>
<p>That night, however, the log was empty, probably due to a big meeting
that night on the village's future, Dickinson said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/m/empire_bar_lake.jpg" alt="The beach at Empire's South Bar Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Empire, the beach at South Bar Lake is a stone's throw from the
beach on Lake Michigan.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Like every other beautiful place, the unpretentious little village is
under siege by developers; already, there's an exclusive community just
up the hill from the beach, with a road marked &quot;Private.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's urban sprawl,&quot; she said. &quot;Cottages are being mowed down and
big houses are going up.&quot;</p>
<p>Discovering the Sleeping Bear Dunes is a windfall for those who love
sun, sea and sand. But those shifting winds keep blowing.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : Travelers from the west must go around or over Lake
Michigan. The easiest way is via the <a href="http://www.ssbadger.com">S.S.
Badger</a> car ferry between Manitowoc, Wis., and
Ludington, Mich.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : Summer is the best time for water play, though July and
August is most crowded. Late June may be the best time; when we were
there, the weather was perfect and there were lodging vacancies even on
the weekend.</p>
<p>In late September and early October, the beech-maple forest bursts into
color, and throngs of coho and king salmon swim up the Platte River to
spawn.</p>

In Leland, the historic Fishtown shanties now cater to tourists.
