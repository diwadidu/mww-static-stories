<h2>On Lake Michigan's gorgeous beaches, everyone can find a spot in the sun.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/e/wells_park_beach.jpg" alt="The beach at J.W. Wells State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Upper Peninsula, Wells State Park doesn't get the crowds of
beaches in Lower Michigan.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's funny that some people in the Upper Midwest spend their summer
vacations on the beaches of Cancun or Cape Cod, because the best beaches
in the world are in their own back yard.</p>
<p>Lake Michigan is America's freshwater Riviera, a nearly unending strand
of sand that looks like Florida without the high-rise condos. It's
clean, blue and pleasantly cool, with water temperatures in the 60s, and
in most places it looks just like the ocean.</p>
<p>Add in candy-striped lighthouses and even more ice-cream stands, and
you've got the makings of a great beach holiday — a cheap one, too, if
you're on a budget.</p>
<p>One June, we drove from one spectacular beach to another. The entire
east side of Lake Michigan seems to be a beach; they're at 18 Michigan
state parks, dozens of city and county beaches and Sleeping Bear Dunes
National Lakeshore.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's also a national lakeshore in Indiana, a beach park in Illinois
and unsung but beautiful city beaches in southern Wisconsin as well as
sand-lined state parks farther north.</p>
<p>We can't name a &quot;best&quot; beach, because the best is whichever one you're
at on a hot summer day, and there were way too many for us to check out,
anyway. But here are a few we hated to leave.</p>

<h3>Michigan's Upper Peninsula</h3>
<p>We started at <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=432&amp;type=SPRK">J.W. Wells State
Park</a>, between <em>Menominee</em> and <em>Escanaba.</em> It's just 25 miles from the
Wisconsin border, so we're guessing it's popular with cheeseheads.</p>
<p>This would be the place to go if you don't like crowds. On a gorgeous
Saturday morning in late June, less than a dozen people were on the
well-kept beach, which is shallow and perfect for children.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/manistee_orchard_beach.jpg" alt="The beach at Orchard Beach State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The beach at Orchard Beach State Park north of Manistee is reached by
stairs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Just east of the park, we saw O.B. Fuller Park and a sign for camping,
picnicking and swimming. There were also lots of mom-and-pop resorts and
motels, all with vacancies, plus many of the soft-serve ice-cream stands
that have been pushed out by franchises elsewhere.</p>
<p>U.S. 2 hugs the lake from Menominee to Rapid River and around
Manistique, and there are plenty of beach pull-outs. It struck us that
the west part of the Upper Peninsula would make a great last-minute
beach trip — it's so far from the big cities, it probably never fills
up.</p>
<h3>Michigan's Lower Peninsula</h3>
<p>The first thing we noticed in <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Traverse
City</a></strong>
is that everyone swims. Old people, young people, at all times of the
day. No wonder, because this summer-resort hub has more than its share
of beautiful sand beaches.</p>
<p>On the East Arm of Grand Traverse Bay, <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=501&amp;type=SPRK">Traverse City State
Park</a>
shares a beach with four hotel and condo resorts.</p>
<p>On the West Arm, the marina is flanked by West End Beach and Clinch Park
Beach, where there's a concession building that rents bikes and kayaks
for use on the Boardman River, which connects Boardman Lake to Lake
Michigan.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We know this town gets crazy busy in the summer, but in late June, it
had a mellow beach-town vibe. &quot;I could stay here a week,&quot; Torsten
said.</p>
<p>We hoped to swim at the tip of the Old Mission Peninsula, while visiting
Old Mission Point Lighthouse, but the rock-studded shoreline was
shoe-sucking muck.</p>
<p>It was the same on the other side of the bay, at the tip of the Leelanau
Peninsula in <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=467&amp;type=SPRK">Leelanau State
Park</a>, home of the 1852 Grand Traverse Lighthouse.</p>
<p>But <em>Leland</em> and <em>Northport</em> have great little beaches , and we also saw
one at <em>Suttons Bay</em> , a boutique town closer to Traverse City.</p>
<p>Traveling down the back of Michigan's &quot;mitten,&quot; we came to
<a href="http://www.nps.gov/slbe/index.htm">Sleeping Bear Dunes National
Lakeshore</a>, which has lots of
beaches. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/sleeping-bear-dunes/">Grand
sand</a>.</p>
<p>We liked the one in the town of <em>Empire</em>  best. It has basketball and
volleyball courts, an old-fashioned playground and a picturesque little
lighthouse, a memorial to a local fisherman who always wanted a light to
guide him home.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/m/empire_platte_mouth.jpg" alt="Playing on the Platte River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Sleeping Bear Dunes, the mouth of the Platte River is a popular place
to play.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For kids, there's a beach with warmer water on South Bar Lake, just
across the parking lot, with a dock that children like to run down and
jump off.</p>
<p>Just north of <em>Manistee,</em> we came to <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=480&amp;type=SPRK">Orchard Beach State
Park</a>. At the turn of the century, this blufftop, from which stairs lead to
the beach, had a theater, boardwalk and pavilion, connected to town by
streetcar. In 1921, the state bought it and put in a 166-site
campground.</p>
<p>Now, campers get their own uncrowded beach, though they have to climb
the stairs to use a bathroom or get a drink. It's a gorgeous beach; on
the morning after a storm, the lake was kicking up a few whitecaps, and
the beach looked more like the Caribbean than Michigan.</p>
<h3>Some serious beach towns</h3>
<p>You'll find the crowds at <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=468&amp;type=SPRK">Ludington State
Park</a>
just north of <strong>Ludington.</strong> You could spend a week here without
stepping out of the park, and no doubt many people do.</p>
<p>We watched families tubing down the Sable River, riding bikes on trails,
swimming in Hamlin Lake and walking through the dunes to the Big Sable
Point Lighthouse. That night, a Dixieland jazz band played in the
amphitheater.</p>
<p>We picnicked along the river, rode bikes to the lighthouse, chatted with
the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/volunteer-lighthouse-keepers/">volunteer
keeper</a>
and a friendly campground host and looked inside the concession/gift
shop, which sells rafts and tubes.</p>
<p>The road from Ludington is lined with dunes, and according to our park
map, there's a state-park beach on Lake Michigan. But there was so much
else to do, we completely forgot to check it out.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_buffalo_beach.jpg" alt="The beach in New Buffalo, Mich." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A decorative lighthouse stands on the town beach in New Buffalo, Mich.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We skipped Mears, Silver Lake and Duck Lake state parks but drove
through <a href="http://www.visitmuskegon.org/">Muskegon</a>. Flat, wide Pere
Marquette Park looks like a beach in California, and houses across the
street have sand in their yards.</p>
<p>It was the end of the day when we arrived at <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=458&amp;type=SPRK">Holland State
Park</a>
in <a href="http://holland.org/">Holland</a>, but people still were heading toward
the beach along Ottawa Beach Road, the only access.</p>
<p>The park is a favorite spot to watch the sunset, which turns the harbor
lighthouse flame-red, and to walk along the breakwall and boardwalk.</p>
<p>The next morning, we watched bicyclists laden with beach towels
streaming into the park, whose parking lot fills by 10 a.m. on holiday
weekends. The beach is not as shallow as some of the others, so I got in
a good swim.</p>
<p>I didn't get to try even one of the 24 flavors of soft-serve from the
pavilion cafe, because we had to move on to <strong>Saugatuck.</strong> We had lunch
and checked out the shops but not Oval Beach, which you can reach from
downtown via a hand-cranked chain ferry across the Kalamazoo River.</p>
<p>Farther on, in <a href="http://www.southhaven.org">South Haven</a>, there was an
e-coli alert at South Beach, so we kept going. Too bad — we know it's
a favorite getaway for many people.</p>
<p>When we got to <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=504&amp;type=SPRK">Warren Dunes State
Park</a>, on the Red Arrow Highway near <em>Sawyer</em> , it was 86 degrees and I was
dying for a swim. We stayed until the sun went down, swimming and
walking along the beach; like everyone else there, we were reluctant to
leave.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/holland_lighthouse_beach.jpg" alt="The beach and lighthouse at Holland State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Now that we were close to Chicago, we figured the beaches would become
unbearably crowded and the towns unaffordably chic. But we really liked
the relaxed beach atmosphere in <a href="http://newbuffalo.org">New Buffalo</a>,
the closest town to the Indiana border.</p>
<p>People were streaming across a causeway from the little downtown, where
a few boutiques mixed with a pharmacy, a dollar store and the ubiquitous
fudge shop. We joined them and spent an hour on the beach.</p>
<p>We saw train tracks through town and stopped at the nearby Harbor Grand
Hotel &amp; Suites, where a friendly desk clerk handed us a schedule for
Amtrak's <a href="http://marp.org/Amtrak_W22.pdf">Wolverine and Blue Water
Service</a>. The train leaves Chicago's
Union Station three times a day and arrives in New Buffalo two and a
quarter hours later.</p>
<p>Now <em>there's</em> a painless weekend getaway.</p>
<h3>On to Indiana</h3>
<p>And then we weren't in Michigan any more. Indiana made us nervous;
according to our maps, we should have been in <a href="https://www.nps.gov/indu/index.htm"><strong>Indiana Dunes National
Park</strong></a>, but we couldn't find it.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/warren_dunes_dusk.jpg" alt="Warren Dunes at dusk." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Three women walk along the beach at Warren Dunes State Park at dusk.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Finally, after driving along a narrow unmarked road crowded by weeds, we
found a beach, from which we were turned away because the parking lot
was full.</p>
<p>We kept driving and, half an hour later, finally made it to the inland
national-park visitors center, where an eager-to-please young ranger
explained that the closest beach to Chicago, West Beach, actually was
easiest to get into because there's a fee to get into it.</p>
<p>Before leaving the center, we watched a movie about the national park
— created as a national lakeshore in 1966 on the same day U.S. Steel,
which had bought 1,200 acres of the dunes, got public funds for the Port
of Indiana. Hmmm.</p>
<p>Then we kept driving west, past the U.S. Steel mill in Burns Harbor to
West Beach.</p>
<p>The park was lovely, with golden dunes reflected in wetland ponds lined
with lily pads. We walked the Secession Trail through the dunes, and
then I cooled off in the water, though it was the first place where
we'd seen algae and silt.</p>
<p>The beach was beautiful, too, though flanked by steel mills, and we
could see the skyscrapers of Chicago in the distance. Lifeguards kept
watch on swimmers and, while we were there, tracked down two
12-year-olds who had wandered off.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Swimming may not have been such a great idea, though.</p>
<p>When I got home, I read about <a href="https://www.change.org/p/save-the-dunes-please-hold-u-s-steel-accountable-for-clean-water-act-violations">multiple discharges containing toxic
chemicals</a>, which have shut down beaches and closed public water intakes.</p>
<h3>Illinois</h3>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/">Chicago</a>
has 15 miles of beaches along its 29 miles of shoreline. The Ohio Street
Beach is a stone's throw from Navy Pier, and Oak Street Beach adjoins
the Gold Coast.</p>
<p>There's a party atmosphere more like a beach resort than a huge
metropolis, with restaurants blaring '50s music, sand volleyball
pick-up games and cafes set up on the sand.</p>
<p>There are lifeguards, too, keeping long hours. A fun and easy way to
visit the beaches is by
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-Chicago-Lakefront-Trail/">bicycle</a>.</p>
<p>There's a different atmosphere at Illinois' only state beach park —
call it neglect and decay. <a href="https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/parks/pages/adelinejaygeo-karisillinoisbeach.aspx">Illinois Beach State
Park</a>
has six miles of sand from Waukegan to the Wisconsin border, but
concession buildings and bathhouses were rundown and parking lots
overgrown.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/n/indiana_dunes_beach.jpg" alt="The beach at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The beach at Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore is flanked by steel mills.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The beach itself is perfectly nice, and the park, which includes
campsites, was filled with a gorgeous array of wildflowers, many more
than we'd seen anywhere else. Too bad, Illinois.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Just across the border, <a href="http://www.visitkenosha.com/"><strong>Kenosha</strong></a> has
a beautiful sand beach. Simmons Island Beach is bordered by a long
concrete pier, and at the end sits the red 1901 Pierhead Light.</p>
<p>A shorter breakwater light, white with a green stripe, is on the other
end of the harbor entrance. Up on the hill is the 1866 Southport
Lighthouse, built of Cream City brick.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.racine.org">Racine</a> has <a href="http://www.racine.org/north_beach.html">North
Beach</a>, a broad expanse of
lovely white sand with a wooden castle playground called Kids Cove.</p>
<p>Concerts are held downtown at the marina, where there's a red 1910
breakwater light. Nearby, Pershing Park has a fountain with two dozen
jets that kids like to run through on hot days.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_oak_street_beach2.jpg" alt="Chicago's Oak Street Beach." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Not far from Chicago's Magnificent Mile, Oak Street Beach draws crowds.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a> also has beautiful
beaches, including the gleaming white sand of <a href="https://www.visitmilwaukee.org/partners/bradford-beach-5422/">Bradford
Beach</a>,
which has lifeguards, a bathhouse, concession buildings and volleyball
courts.</p>
<p>Between Port Washington and Sheboygan, <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/harrington/">Harrington Beach State
Park</a> has a mile of
beach and a new campground.</p>
<p>Just south of Sheboygan, <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kohlerandrae/">Kohler-Andrae State
Park</a> has a long beach
lined by dunes. It also has an accessible beach trail and two beach
wheelchairs.</p>
<p>In <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/sheboygan-wisconsin/">Sheboygan</a>,
Deland Park has a large, lovely white-sand beach with playgrounds,
restrooms and the salvaged wreck of the Lottie Cooper. It's also a
favorite of surfers, who show up on on windy days and after gales.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/pointbeach/">Point Beach State
Forest</a>, north of Two
Rivers on Lake Michigan, has a lovely white-sand beach and a classic
lighthouse. There's a nature lodge/concession center, too.</p>

<p><strong>In <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/">Door County</a>,</strong> <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/peninsula/">Peninsula State
Park</a> on Green Bay is
almost like a resort, with bicycle trails, a professional theater and a
golf course as well as beaches.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/newport/">Newport State Park</a>,
Wisconsin's only wilderness park, includes Europe Bay, a beautiful,
quiet crescent of sand lined by wildflowers.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Baileys Harbor, the beach at Ridges Road County Park is breezy, cool
and a favorite of kiteboarders.</p>
<p>At the tip of the peninsula, the east side of <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/rockisland/">Rock Island State
Park</a> is lined with
beaches, mostly enjoyed by campers. Access requires two ferry crossings.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Beaches of Lake Michigan</h3>
<p><em>What to know:</em> Most Lake Michigan beaches tend to be shallow, which
makes the water a lovely blue. The gradual drop-offs make them good for
children, but few beaches have lifeguards, so keep an eye on them.</p>
<p>Look for red flags and signs warning of dangerous currents. Waves are
shorter than the ocean and, when mixed with wind, can create rip
currents.</p>
<p>Temperatures vary from the low 60s early in the season to the upper 60s;
the surface can be warmer. At state parks (except Illinois), you'll
need a vehicle permit, and some town beaches charge $5 or $6 for
parking. Or, you can bicycle or walk in.</p>
<p><em>When to go:</em> The first three weeks of June are less crowded, and days
are long. Late August is less crowded, and September is a very good time
to visit.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_rivers_point_beach.jpg" alt="The beach at Point Beach State Forest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
