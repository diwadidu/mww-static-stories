</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Big, bad Lake Superior.</p>
<p>It's big as in vast, with a surface area equal to Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire combined.</p>
<p>It's bad as in lethal, able to swallow ore boats or pulverize them
against the hard volcanic rock that lines its shore. And it's</p>
<ul>
<li>like an enraged bull, its crushing waves can turn on a
dime.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, how we love this lake.</p>
<p>Bill and JoAnne Palmer of Tucson, Ariz., like it best at its worst, when
waves are gun-metal gray and skies filled with thunderclouds.</p>
<p>&quot;This is great,&quot; said Bill Palmer, watching a storm approach Duluth's
Kitchi Gammi Park one August. &quot;It could snow, and I'd be happy as a
clam. We love the weather. &quot;In Tucson, we have sunshine 300 days a
year, and our visitors say, 'Oh, isn't this beautiful.' &quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He made a face.</p>
<p>A cold rain began, and thunder boomed overhead. Wearing blissful smiles,
the Palmers finally left.</p>
<p>A North Shore beach is the place to find weather, all right — often,
several kinds in a single day. Stony Point is known as the place to
watch giant waves crash against shore.</p>
<p>Other beaches attract agate-hunters and stone-skippers, birders and
sunbathers, even swimmers in rare instances.</p>
<h3>Going on a beach hunt</h3>
<p>One August, I went on a North Shore beach safari with my son Peter,
who's loved rocks since he learned to walk. From Kitchi Gammi Park, we
drove through drizzle until we got to the lodge at <em>Lutsen Resort</em> .</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_cove.jpg" alt="Fishing at Lutsen Lodge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Guests at Lutsen Lodge love its beach, where the Poplar River flows into
Lake Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The pebble cove in front of this 1952 lodge is one of the prettiest and
most beloved spots in Minnesota. A covered bridge spans the mouth of the
Poplar River, which splits the beach in two and joins the lake in flecks
of root-beer froth.</p>
<p>From the bridge, a footpath leads to the boulder-strewn base of a cliff
and either around or down to a spit of sand frequented by ducks and
gulls.</p>
<p>Beach stretches below the lodge, too, and that's where we found the most
treasures: oddly shaped driftwood, bits of quartz, greenstone as
smoothly creased as a palm.</p>
<p>And there were chunks of black basalt with holes in them, formed by gas
bubbles when this shore was a seething mass of lava.</p>
<p>These rocks tell a billion-year-old story. The jagged basalt and granite
boulders along the shore once were lava, in which escaping steam formed
cavities as it cooled.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Dissolved minerals of different colors flowed into the cavities, layer
by layer, and hardened; over time, they were freed from surrounding rock
by fracturing and erosion, and eventually picked up and spread by
glaciers.</p>
<p>Now they're prized as Lake Superior agates, the Minnesota state
gemstone, and they're found all along the North Shore.</p>
<p>The best ones actually are found in inland gravel pits, but it's so much
more fun to look on a beach. Besides, other nifty rocks tend to turn up,
too.</p>
<p>&quot;There are lots of cool rocks on the North Shore, but agates are what
everyone's focused on,&quot; says Rick Kollrath, a Duluth rock-climber and
kayaker. &quot;They're crazy about 'em.&quot;</p>
<p>Kollrath and naturalist Mark &quot;Sparky&quot; Stensaas are the illustrator and
author of &quot;Rock Picker's Guide to Lake Superior's North Shore,&quot; which,
to their amazement, became a hit when they published it.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_harbor.jpg" alt="Cobblestones line Grand Marais' harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The cobblestones on the Grand Marais beach are perfect for skipping.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Taking a tip from their guide, we went to <em>Good Harbor Bay</em> south of
Grand Marais to look for Thomsonite, a semiprecious gemstone with bands
of pink and green that formed out of a single lava flow and is found
only along this six-mile stretch.</p>
<p>To my surprise, I actually found one, looking like a small, cracked
tooth with two bands of pink, and Peter was thrilled by an
arrowhead-shaped piece of sandstone.</p>
<p>From the bay's Cutface Creek Wayside, we drove into downtown <em>Grand
Marais</em> and made a beeline for the beach, whose flat, smooth red stones
are perfect for skipping.</p>
<p>No one was skipping, but two people were kayaking, one was flying a
rainbow-colored box kite and 8-year-old Brittney Farrow of Minneapolis
was feeding bread to seagulls.</p>
<p>Brittney loves gulls, said parent Jacquelyn Farrow, and she was sure
that one of them was &quot;Sarah,&quot; a gull she named three years ago in
Duluth when it perched on her hotel balcony.</p>
<p>&quot;So all she wanted to do this time was come up and see Sarah,&quot; Farrow
said with a laugh, &quot;whom we've seen about a million times.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/a/kadunce_beach.jpg" alt="A sunburst of rocks on a beach." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At the mouth of the Kadunce River, an anonymous artist left a sunburst
for others to enjoy.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At Artists' Point, just beyond the Coast Guard station, we explored a
beach of boulders, a Cubist landscape in which an artistic someone had
stacked stones into tall cairns and arches.</p>
<p>&quot;This is my idea of a perfect place to play,&quot; Peter said.</p>
<h3>The glint of agates</h3>
<p>It was drizzling again when we reached <em>Paradise Beach</em> east of town,
and we sat in the car until Peter said, &quot;This rain will make the agates
shine, right?&quot; He was right, so we hunched under umbrellas and plunged
our hands into the clean, glistening pebbles as if they were King Midas'
coins.</p>
<p>We did hit gold, a brown agate crowded with white eyes that looked
already polished; Lake Superior acts as a giant tumbler.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the <em>Kadunce River</em> , we found a few more, and also a
cleared spot on the beach where another artistic someone had arranged
the flat cobblestones into a sunburst pattern, twisting like the tail of
a comet.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But we found our most success at the curving, protected beach at the
mouth of the <em>Beaver River</em> , just east of Beaver Bay, which the &quot;Rock
Picker's Guide&quot; calls the best agate beach on the North Shore.</p>
<p>We turned up an orange and cream agate with faint bands, then another
with a big yellow eye, and other rocks that made us marvel at their
infinite variations.</p>
<p>Heading back down 61, we stopped at Gooseberry Falls State Park and
right away found a small topaz agate at the mouth of the <em>Gooseberry
River</em> .</p>
<p>But we had even more fun climbing the cliff up to the adjoining point,
where we sat amid the late-summer wildflowers, butterflies and buzzing
crickets.</p>
<p>And we stopped at <em>Burlington Bay</em> in Two Harbors, which adjoins the
municipal campground and has some real sand, a rarity on the shore.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_brighton_beach_sunbather.jpg" alt="Sunbathing at Brighton Beach in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Duluth's Kitchi Gammi Park, known locally as Brighton Beach, is a
favorite spot for sunbathing and picnicking.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On Scenic 61, we turned off to <em>Stony Point</em> , passing the
storm-watchers' post on our way to a quiet meadow with an abandoned fish
house, where the woman who lives across the road was reading an Isabel
Allende book on the narrow, half-hidden beach.</p>
<p>We had one last rock hunt in the sun at <em>Brighton Beach</em> at Duluth's
Kitchi-Gammi Park, where local teens were stretched out on the smooth
rocks, basking like sea lions.</p>
<p>We turned up a few tiny agates for our modest collection. Of course, we
could have bought bigger and better ones, already polished, for a dollar
or two at the Agate Shop in Beaver Bay. But then we would have missed
out on the thrill of the hunt.</p>
<p>&quot;It's frustrating,&quot; Peter said. &quot;But when you find an agate, it's
really fun.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: North Shore beaches</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : It's 151 miles from Duluth's Canal Park to the
Canadian border. For a guide to beaches and other highlights, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-minnesota/trip-planning-north-shore-minnesota/">North
Shore by the
mile</a>.</p>
<p><em>Agate-hunting</em> : If you find a prize agate, take it. But don't haul
away boxes of pretty rocks - leave them for others to enjoy.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/beaver_bay_beach.jpg" alt="Agate hunters on Minnesota's Beaver River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Agate hunters search at the mouth of the Beaver River just east of
Beaver Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Best agate-hunting</em> : The mouth of the Beaver River at Beaver Bay.</p>
<p><em>Best swimming</em> : Duluth's Park Point dunes, across the Aerial Lift
Bridge. The Park Point Recreation Area beach, with beach house and
restrooms, starts off 43rd Street.</p>
<p>It's usually too cold to do more than dash in and out. But
occasionally, the water warms up. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/swimming-holes-beaches-duluth-north-shore/">Swimming in
Superior</a>.</p>
<p><em>Best place to skip stones</em> : Grand Marais Harbor.</p>
<p><em>Best sun-bathing</em> : On the smooth slabs of Kitchi Gammi Park, on the
east edge of Duluth, near the mouth of the Lester River.</p>
<p><em>Best storm-watching</em> : Stony Point on Scenic 61, between the French and
Knife rivers. This is also where you'll see surfers trying to catch the
waves.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/north-shore-scenic-highway/">Minnesota's scenic
61</a>.</p>

The entire Lake Superior shore of Park Point, across the Aerial Lift
Bridge in Duluth, is public beach.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Best natural spots</em> : <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/detail.html?id=sna01000">Iona's Beach
SNA</a>, a
Minnesota scientific and natural area, is known for the musical sounds
it makes when its smooth pieces of rhyolite &quot;shingles&quot; are lifted by
waves and then fall back into place. It's three miles east of
Gooseberry Falls State Park.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sugarloafnorthshore.org/">Sugarloaf Cove</a>, an interpretive
area that's six miles south of Schroeder, includes a U-shaped
cobblestone cove, a wonderful one-mile interpretive trail and a nature
center. Naturalists will confiscate rocks and other neat stuff visitors
try to take — that's why it has a beach that looks the way all the
beaches used to look.</p>
<p><em>Best picnic spot</em> : The point next to Agate Beach in Gooseberry Falls
State Park.</p>
<p><em>Best playground</em> : Artists' Point in Grand Marais, where rounded
stones of varying sizes can be made into cairns and pillars.</p>
<p><em>Best place to hike</em> : Only one part of the Superior Hiking Trail is
along the shore of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Called the Lake Walk, it starts three miles east of the mouth of the
Kadunce River, between Grand Marais and Judge C.R. Magney State Park,
and follows a pebble beach.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : Resorts with good beaches for rock-picking include:</p>
<p>The lodge of <a href="https://www.lutsenresort.com/?__trackcampaign=ZGJYG8Y6">Lutsen
Resort</a> is a
classic, with picture windows overlooking the beach.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomsonite.com">Thomsonite Beach</a> resort, between Lutsen and
Grand Marais, has displays of gem-quality Thomsonite and is known for
the Thomsonite on its beach, though owner Lee Bergstrom says she sends
hunters to the Cutface Creek Wayside on Good Harbor Bay.</p>

Shore</a>.</p>
