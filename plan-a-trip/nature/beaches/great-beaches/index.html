<p>In this region, you don't need oceans for a beach vacation.</p>
<p>We have thousands of lakes, plus inland seas on shoreline that often is
called the Fourth Coast. Lake Michigan's shores are a veritable
Riviera, and even rocky Superior has some noteworthy stretches of sand.</p>
<p>You could throw a dart at the map and come up with a good beach. Or you
could take a cue from names of state parks — Point Beach and
Harrington Beach in Wisconsin, McCarthy Beach in Minnesota, Orchard
Beach in Michigan.</p>
<p>They're big, they're beautiful and they're not far away. Below are
some of this region's best places to lounge away a summer day.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Wisconsin has as many lakes as Minnesota, in such north-woods lake towns
as Hayward,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/minocqua-wisconsin-lake-vacation/">Minocqua</a>
and Eagle River, plus spectacular beaches on Lake Michigan and even Lake
Superior.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.co.door.wi.gov/653/Baileys-Harbor-Ridges-County-Park">Ridges County
Park</a>
in Baileys Harbor.</strong> This sandy beach on the north end of this Door
County town, across from the range lights of Ridges Sanctuary, usually
is one of the coolest spots in the Upper Midwest on hot summer days.</p>
<p>It's fun to watch kiteboarders, who like it because they can swoop from
one side of the harbor to the other without interference from large
boats, for which the harbor is too shallow. There are bathrooms and
picnic tables, but little shade.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/baileys-harbor-door-county/">Baileys Harbor in Door
County</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/pointbeach/">Point Beach State
Forest</a>, north of
Two Rivers.</strong>  This long, lovely white-sand
beach on Lake Michigan includes the 1894 Rawley Point Light and
shipwreck lore; the Rouse Simmons, the famous &quot;Christmas-tree ship,&quot;
sank near here in 1912.</p>
<p>There's a nature lodge, concession center and campground. The six-mile
Rawley Point bicycle trail connects it with Neshotah Park in Two Rivers,
which also has a fine sand beach that hosts the Kites Over Lake Michigan
festival over Labor Day weekend.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_rivers_point_beach.jpg" alt="The beach at Point Beach State Forest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Just north of Two Rivers, Wis., Point Beach State Forest has spectacular
beaches on Lake Michigan.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/two-rivers-manitowoc/">Two trails from Two
Rivers</a>.</p>
<p><em>Big Bay on Madeline Island.</em>  This long, curving beach on the largest
of Wisconsin's Apostles is a beauty, with a mile and a half of
luxurious sand. The annual sand-castle contest in August draws
imaginative artists from all over.</p>
<p>Swimming off the beach in <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/bigbay/">Big Bay State
Park</a> is mighty bracing
until late summer, unless a breeze from the northeast brings in a layer
of warm water.</p>
<p>But people also can follow the beach north to Big Bay Town Park and
splash in the warm water of the lagoon or rent a canoe.</p>
<p>To the south, shoreline trails lead onto sandstone outcroppings. For
more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/madeline-island-wisconsin/">Madeline's
magnetism</a>.</p>
<p><em>Europe Bay in northern Door County.</em>  This beach in <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/newport/">Newport State
Park</a>, Wisconsin's only
formally designated wilderness park, is long, curving and scenic, lined
by wildflowers and grasses. It's good for swimming, depending on the
mood of Lake Michigan, and you'll rarely find a crowd.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/door-county-outdoors/">Outdoors in Door
County</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><em>Rock Island in Door County.</em>  Surrounded by Lake Michigan, this island,
entirely <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/rockisland/">Rock Island State
Park</a>, is cool in
summer and warm in fall. It's as far east as you can go in Wisconsin,
and the islands off Michigan's Garden Peninsula can be seen from its
lighthouse.</p>
<p>Campers get the best use of its beautiful south-shore beaches because
ferry schedules limit the time day-trippers can spend there. If the lake
is calm, though, canoeists and kayakers easily can cross the mile-long
strait from Washington Island.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/rock-island-state-park-wisconsin/">Wisconsin's Icelandic
outpost</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://bradfordbeachmke.com/main.html">Bradford Beach</a> in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a>.</strong>   The gleaming white sand of this popular
beach is near downtown, along the Oak Leaf Trail. It has lifeguards, a
bathhouse, concession buildings and volleyball courts.</p>
<p><em>More beaches.</em>  Between Port Washington and Sheboygan, <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/harrington/">Harrington
Beach State Park</a> has a
mile of beach and a campground.</p>
<p>A short walk from downtown
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/sheboygan-wisconsin/">Sheboygan</a>,
Deland Park is popular with surfers.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/sheboygan_surfer2.jpg" alt="A surfer in Sheboygan." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near downtown Sheboygan, a surfer walks along the beach of Deland Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>South of Sheboygan, <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kohlerandrae/">Kohler-Andrae State
Park</a> has a dune
beach. It also has an accessible beach trail and two beach wheelchairs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kenoshacvb.com/">Kenosha</a> has a beautiful sand beach.
Simmons Island Beach is bordered by a long concrete pier, and at the end
sits the red 1901 Pierhead Light.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.racine.org/">Racine</a> has <a href="http://www.racine.org/north_beach.html">North
Beach</a>, a broad expanse of
lovely white sand with a wooden castle playground called Kids Cove.</p>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/minneapolis-chain-lakes/">Chain of
Lakes</a>
beaches in Minneapolis.</strong>  If you can't find a place to swim in
Minneapolis, you're not looking very hard.</p>
<p>The Grand Rounds connects the beaches on Nokomis, Harriet, Bde Maka Ska
and Cedar lakes. The larger main Nokomis beach has a floating swimming
dock, large fee parking area and the beach bistro
<a href="https://www.paintedturtlempls.com/">Painted Turtle</a>; there's a smaller beach on
the other side of the lake that has no lifeguard or bathhouse.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_calhoun_walk.jpg" alt="People walking around Lake Calhoun." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Minneapolis, walkers approach the marina on Bde Maka Ska, formerly
Lake Calhoun.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Lake Harriet has two small family beaches; North Beach has a floating
swimming dock and is not far from the bandshell, playground and
concessions at <a href="http://breadandpickle.com/">Bread &amp; Pickle</a>.</p>
<p>There's parking in the neighborhoods and a fee parking lot next to the
bandshell that often fills.</p>
<p>The lake of Bde Maka Ska, formerly Lake Calhoun, is more open and
attracts singles from the Uptown area. On the south end of the lake,
Thomas Beach has a floating swimming dock and sand-volleyball courts.
There's a small fee parking lot.</p>
<p>On the north end, there's a canoe and kayak rental, flanked by North
Beach and 32nd Beach. It's hard to find parking.</p>
<p>Cedar is the quietest lake. East Cedar Beach, reached through the
Kenwood neighborhood, has been known as Hidden Beach; it's not too hard
to find parking on nearby streets. Cedar Point and Cedar South beaches
have a few free parking spots.</p>
<p>There's also a beach on Lake Hiawatha, near Lake Nokomis. Lifeguard
schedules vary.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_forests/facilities/cmp00013/index.html">Pelican
Lake</a>
near Nisswa, Minn.</strong> For all its fame as
a summer vacation destination, the Brainerd Lakes area has very few
places where the public can take a dip.</p>
<p>In fact, this beach in <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_forests/sft00014/index.html">Crow Wing State
Forest</a> is
pretty much it. But it's a beauty, with a broad swath of sand and
expansive lake views.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/nisswa_pelican_beach.jpg" alt="The beach on Pelican Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Pelican Lake has one of the few public beaches in the Brainerd-Nisswa
area.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's shallow, so it's good for playing but not swimming. And it's a
great place to escape the heat. On a 95-degree day one July, my family
and I spent a whole afternoon just sitting in the cool water, rising
occasionally to toss a Frisbee.</p>
<p>It's a little tricky to get there. From Nisswa, head east on County
Road 18 and then County Road 4 to its intersection with 118. From there,
it's 1.7 miles to Pelican Beach Road; turn left, and the beach is
another mile.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/nisswa-turtle-races/">Fast times in
Nisswa</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.co.washington.mn.us/facilities/facility/details/Square-Lake-Park-18">Square Lake</a> near
Stillwater, Minn.</strong>  The lake in this county park is as clear as it gets
in the Twin Cities area, so it's the go-to spot for scuba students and
their teachers. Next to the sandy beach, there's a shaded grassy area
that's nice for picnics.</p>
<p>The park is near the eastern trailhead of the <a href="http://www.gatewaytrailmn.org/">Gateway State
Trail</a>, so it makes a nice destination
for bicyclists. Motorists can reach it from Stillwater by heading north
on Minnesota 95, then west on Square Lake Trail. From St. Paul,
Minnesota 36 east, Manning Avenue north, Minnesota 96 east, Norell
Avenue north and Square Lake Trail east.</p>
<p>There's fee parking.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_park_point_beach_kids.jpg" alt="Kids play on the Park Point beach." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.mnbeaches.org/beaches/lksuperior/B003.shtml">Park Point</a>
in Duluth, Minn.</strong>  This Lake Superior beach
is where you go if it's really hot or you're feeling really hardy. The
dunes start just east of the Aerial Lift Bridge and line this six-mile
sandbar right up to the Superior Entry.</p>
<p>It's all public, but the Park Point Recreation Area beach, with beach
house and restrooms, starts off 43rd Street. The view of hillside
Duluth, hazy in the hot summer sun, is a bonus.</p>
<p>Rip currents can make swimming dangerous, for watch for the red flags
that warn of them. Even if the flag is green, be careful. If you get
caught, swim sideways.</p>
<p>Parking is free. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/minnesota-wisconsin-points/">Dunes of Duluth</a> and

<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/father_hennepin/index.html">Father Hennepin State
Park</a>
<em>on Mille Lacs in Minnesota.</em>  Little
more than an hour and a half north the Twin Cities, this small but
lovely park includes prime beachfront on big Mille Lacs Lake.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On a hot day, it's a particularly nice destination for bicyclists on
the paved Soo Line Trail, which stretches 11 miles between Onamia and
Isle.</p>
<p><em>Zippel Bay on Lake of the Woods.</em>  At the top of Minnesota, visitors to
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/zippel_bay/index.html">Zippel Bay State
Park</a> can
look across 80 miles of inland sea toward Kenora, Ontario. The park's
centerpiece is two miles of white sand lined with wildflowers, including
lady's slippers and many other orchids.</p>
<p>A stone jetty marks a harbor from which turn-of-the-century sturgeon
fishermen once sent their fish to East Coast markets.</p>
<p>For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/dancing-sky/">Waters of the dancing
sky</a>.</p>
<p><em>Green Lake in Spicer, Minn.</em> Nothing says &quot;summer&quot; more than a day
at Spicer's big Saulsbury Beach. There's usually a cutthroat game of
beach volleyball going on, and swimmers line up to jump off a tower on
one of two rafts.</p>

<h3>Michigan</h3>
<p>Michigan is blessed with <strong>dozens of fabulous beaches</strong> on three Great
Lakes. They're all lovely, but the ones on the Lake Michigan side are
best for swimming.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-lake-michigan/">America's freshwater
Riviera</a>.</p>
<p><em>Platte River Point in Michigan's Sleeping Bear Dunes National
Lakeshore.</em>  This is a great place to play. Swimmers can run back and
forth between the warm, crystal-clear waters of the shallow river and
cold Lake Michigan, whose sandy bottom is sprinkled with flat stones
that are perfect for skipping.</p>
<p>There's a grassy picnic area, and small sand dunes that kids like to
run up and down.</p>
<p>There's the same choice of warm/cold at the Lake Michigan/South Bar
Lake beaches in nearby Empire, where locals go to watch the sunset, and
at the more remote Lake Michigan/North Bar Lake beaches, whose dunes
look like they belong on the Atlantic Coast, not in the Midwest.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.traversecity.com/listings/clinch-park/412/">Clinch Park</a>
in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Traverse City,
Mich</a>.</strong> Traverse City is one of the nation's great beach towns, with beaches
lining both the West Arm and East Arm of Lake Michigan's Grand Traverse
Bay.</p>
<p>It's also just a hop from fingerlike Lake Leelanau, Torch and Elk lakes
and more than 100 other lakes, not to mention the open waters of Lake
Michigan.</p>
<p>Clinch Park is near the town's adorable downtown and adjoins the
marina. There's a splashpad for kids and a concession that rents kayaks
for use on the Boardman River, which connects Boardman Lake to Lake
Michigan.</p>
<p>Its beach has lifeguards and is flanked by the West End and Bryant Park
beaches. The paved, 10½-mile TART bike trail connects them to Traverse
City State Park across from the East Arm, where a pedestrian overpass
leads to the beach.</p>
<p>Just to the west, East Bay Beach is good for children because it has a
gradual slope and lifeguards.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_oak_beach_palms.jpg" alt="Oak Street Beach in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3>Illinois</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/oak-street-beach">Oak Street
Beach</a>
in Chicago.</strong>  The nation's third-biggest city has 15 miles of
beautiful beaches.</p>
<p>Oak Street Beach is just a few steps from bustling Michigan Avenue, but
it may as well be in another time zone, with its California vibe and
easygoing beach culture.</p>
<p>Sit under an umbrella at a beachside cafe table or swim laps in the
65-degree water.</p>
<p>Nearby, the <em>Ohio Street Beach</em> is a stone's throw from Navy Pier. To
the north, on the south end of Lincoln Park, <em>North Avenue Beach</em> has
restrooms and parking and is very popular with young people.</p>
<p>The 18-mile Lakeshore Trail connects the beaches. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-Chicago-Lakefront-Trail/">Chicago by bicycle</a>.</p>
