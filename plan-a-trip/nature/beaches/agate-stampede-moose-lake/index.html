<h2>Every year, this Minnesota town introduces budding rockhounds to the thrill of the hunt.</h2>

During Moose Lake's Agate Stampede, children sift through tons of rock
for agates and quarters.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's no secret there's buried treasure right here in Minnesota.</p>
<p>It's in every gravel pit, along every railroad track, on every beach.
All you have to do is look to find a Lake Superior agate, Minnesota's
official state gemstone.</p>
<p>And every July, agates also can be found spread over Moose Lake's main
street — 400 pounds of them, some even polished, hidden along with
2,000 quarters in 4 tons of rock.</p>
<p>It's the Agate Stampede, centerpiece of Moose Lake's annual Agate
Days, put on by the diehard rockhounds of the Carlton County Gem and
Mineral Club.</p>
<p>Carlton County, at the rim of the basin that once held Glacial Lake
Duluth, is at the heart of Lake Superior agate country. Agates were
created more than a billion years ago by dissolved minerals that flowed,
layer by layer, into gas bubbles that formed in cooling lava.</p>
<p>Squeezed into hard stone, they were freed from surrounding rock by
fracturing and erosion, and eventually picked up and spread by glaciers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Today, the colorful, semiprecious stones are found with other deposits
of glacial debris, primarily in gravel pits, but also washed up along
rivers and lakes.</p>
<p>The distinctive, glassy bands left by silica and other minerals appear
in endless variations on the agates, which makes them fun to collect —
and show off.</p>
<p>When my kids and I went to the Agate Days show in Moose Lake High
School, Stan Peterson of Cloquet took a shadow agate out of his case and
showed it us.</p>
<p>&quot;Because the lines are so close together, when you move it, it changes
your perspective,&quot; he said, moving it from side to side. &quot;It looks
like water, doesn't it? It's an optical illusion.&quot;</p>
<p>Peterson said that he and his wife, Fran, live near a gravel pit and
have been picking for decades; as longtime members of the Gem and
Mineral Club, they contributed many pounds of agates to the stampede.</p>
<p>&quot;We do this for the joy of picking and showing them off,&quot; he said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/g/agates.jpg" alt="Lake Superior agates." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Chris Polydoroff</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The rock spread on Elm Street is seeded with agates, some raw and some
already polished.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Other rockhounds were showing pink rhodochrosite from Argentina, &quot;crazy
lace&quot; agates from Mexico and momsonite from Oregon, with green, blue
and red splotches that looked like little watercolor paintings.</p>
<p>Of course, we knew we weren't going to find agates that looked like
that. Margaret Maine of New Hope, helping out at a friend's stand,
showed us what an agate in the rough might look like — coated with
waxy, peanut-butterlike jasper, perhaps, and pitted, like a rotten
potato.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a really fun hobby,&quot; she said. &quot;Oh, it's so exciting. The
largest one I found was this big.&quot; She cupped her hands as if around
an ostrich egg.</p>
<p>In downtown Moose Lake, a crowd was watching as a green dump truck
spread rocks all along Elm Street, in front of the Lake Theatre. At the
crack of a cannon, people ran in.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I see one right there, 4 inches from that guy's shoe,&quot; said
longtime collector Margret Todd of Chisago City, who nevertheless kept
quiet as her granddaughters looked. &quot;Oh, I just want to dig in.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But eventually, little Courtney found a red half-pounder with a glassy
surface, and she held it up as a TV cameraman zoomed in for a close-up.</p>
<p>&quot;Pretty darn good for a 6-year-old, huh?&quot; Todd said proudly. &quot;I
think all kids should learn how to do this.&quot;</p>
<p>On one end of the street, Heidi Bailey of Lakeville was dressed for
success, with long gloves, a bag slung over her shoulders and red
plastic tongs and a spray bottle in her hands.</p>
<p>When she found a likely rock, she'd spritz it with water to see if a
shiny surface peeked through the dirt.</p>
<p>&quot;We make it a rockhound weekend,&quot; said Bailey, who was camping
nearby with her sister and their daughters. &quot;It's a fun deal, and you
can go up to Duluth. We've gone up the lake from Duluth, but we've
never found anything. We've found more on the dirt road outside the
campground.&quot;</p>
<p>My kids didn't fare so well. Madeleine had simply picked out pretty
rocks, and Peter had stuffed his newsboy's cloth bag with rocks,
period. &quot;I just wish they were all agates,&quot; he said glumly.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/o/moose_lake_museum.jpg" alt="Munger Trail in Moose Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Madeleine gave one of her rocks to Lois Allen of Minneapolis, who spat
on it and rubbed it with her finger. &quot;You can always tell a rockhound;
she's got dirt in her teeth,&quot; she joked, before telling Madeleine
the rock was indeed an agate.</p>
<p>Allen, who once ran a rock shop and was on the committee that made the
agate the state gemstone in 1969, had brought her daughter Nicole and
two of Nicole's friends up to the stampede.</p>
<p>Between them, they'd found a half-dozen beautiful agates, including a
zebra and an eye agate. They must've been good luck; as I turned away,
I looked down at my feet and saw a polished topaz agate, the size of a
small arrowhead.</p>
<p>Then we returned to the high school for another look at the exhibits.
Peter paid $1 to buy a polished agate from retired teacher Ed Bender,
and 25 cents to get a handful of little ones from a gumball machine.</p>
<p>But then, Bender gave him another quarter's worth free, as well as a
shiny piece of jasper. Peter was awestruck.</p>
<p>&quot;I love this place,&quot; he said. &quot;That guy is super nice. Can we come
back tomorrow? All of a sudden, I'm so interested in rocks.&quot;</p>
<p>Voila! Another rockhound is born.</p>
