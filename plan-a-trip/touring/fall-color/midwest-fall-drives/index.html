<p>On a crisp, sunny fall day, we all get the urge to go for a drive.</p>
<p>The countryside is alight with color, and there's a lot going on —
art-studio tours, corn mazes, hay rides and harvest festivals in every
little town.</p>
<p>And you'll be chasing the colors, of course.</p>
<p>You probably could throw a dart at the map and find a pretty spot, but
here are 15 routes that we think are especially beautiful.</p>
<p>If fall color doesn't materialize when you expect it to, don't worry:
These drives are pretty great any time.</p>

Byways</a>.</p>
<h3>Grant Wood country</h3>
<p>Drive amid the rolling hills of eastern Iowa and you'll get the feeling
you've seen it somewhere before — and you have, in the paintings of
artist Grant Wood, who was born in Anamosa, founded an artists' colony
in Stone City and worked in a studio in Cedar Rapids.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.traveliowa.com/trails/grant-wood-scenic-byway/5/">Grant Wood Scenic
Byway</a>
stretches 68 miles, from Anamosa to Bellevue on the Mississippi River.
The most scenic part is around Anamosa; be sure to take Iowa E-28 west
of Anamosa to Stone City on the Wapsipinicon River, and in Anamosa, stop
to see the castle-like state penitentiary.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stone_city_fall.jpg" alt="Stone City near Anamosa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Byway.

<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/great-river-road/northeast-Iowa-fall/">Mississippi River vistas</a></h3>
<p>To people who think Iowa is flat, the state's northeast corner will be
a revelation.</p>
<p>Lining the Mississippi is a procession of softly rounded bluffs,
reminiscent of the Rhine Valley. From their 500-foot peaks, visitors can
admire panoramas of the vast river plain below.</p>
<p>Start in the hillside town of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/lansing-iowa-mississippi/">Lansing</a>, where Mount
Hosmer City Park gives a spectacular front-row view of the river and the
valleys and ridges beyond.</p>
<p>Follow the river south to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/efmo/index.htm">Effigy Mounds National
Monument</a>, where interpretive trails
lead to the 137-foot-long Great Bear Mound, one of 191 ancient burial
mounds built on the blufftop.</p>
<p>Marquette is below, tucked under the bridge, where the gaudy Lady Luck
casino boat is docked.
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mcgregor-iowa/">McGregor</a> is just
down the road, sitting in a little bowl hugged by limestone-pocked
bluffs on each side.</p>
<p>Called the Pocket City, it's filled with old brick storefronts that
house antiques shops and inns. On the bluffside outside town, tour Spook
Cave in aluminum fishing boats.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>High above McGregor, the hiking trails of Pikes Peak State Park offer
more vistas of the river plain.</p>
<p>From Pikes Peak, a roller-coaster ride through bucolic farmland leads to
<a href="https://cityofguttenbergia.gov/">Guttenberg</a>, still lined with stolid
limestone storefronts built by early German settlers. It celebrates
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/GuttenbergGermanfest/">GermanFest</a> on Sept. 23-24 in 2022.</p>
<p>Lock and Dam No. 10 is here; you can watch the barges from the gazebo in
Guttenberg's lovely riverside park.</p>
<p>For a loop, take the car ferry across the river at Cassville and make
your way up the Wisconsin side to <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/prairie-du-chien/">Prairie du
Chien</a>.</p>
<h3>Touring historic barns</h3>
<p>Iowa has taken the lead nationwide in preserving barns, and they come in
every shape, size and color in this farm state.</p>
<p>You can drive by them at any time, but on the last full weekend in
September, more than 60 of them across the state are open during the
<a href="http://iowabarnfoundation.org/tours/fall-tour.htm">All-State Barn Tour</a>, Sept.
24-25 in 2022.</p>

On the Rock River, paddlewheeler passengers look at a 48-foot statue of
Black Hawk.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h2>Northern Illinois</h2>
<h3>Towns of the Rock River</h3>
<p>For centuries, the Rock River has been an important highway, mostly
notably for the Sauk chief Black Hawk. High in the bluffs above Oregon,
a 48-foot concrete pays tribute to him.</p>
<p>Drive up to Lowden State Park to see him or take a cruise on the Pride
of Oregon paddlewheeler. The <a href="http://www.autumnonparade.org/">Autumn on
Parade</a> fall festival is Oct. 1-2 in
2022.</p>
<p>Head south on Illinois 2 to Castle Rock State Park and Grand Detour,
home of the <a href="http://www.deere.com/wps/dcom/en_US/corporate/our_company/fans_visitors/tours_attractions/historicalsite.page">John Deere Historic
Site</a>.</p>
<p>Dixon is just around the bend from Grand Detour. It's the boyhood home
of Ronald Reagan and the most important stop on the Ronald Reagan Trail,
which includes 12 other northwest Illinois towns.</p>
<p>A third state park is seven miles west of Oregon. White Pines Forest
State Park is a lovely oasis of pine forest, creeks and rock
outcroppings amid the rolling farm fields. In fall, the park is cloaked
in bright reds, oranges and golds.</p>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/oregon-illinois-sightseeing/">On the Rock River in
Illinois</a>.</p>
<p>Keep going north and you'll hit Rockford and the Illinois border; keep
going south and you'll get to Rock Island and the Iowa border.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/l/illinois_high_point_view.jpg" alt="View from Illinois' high point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
This is the view from Charles Mound, Illinois' high point at 1,235 feet
above sea level.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><em>History and a high point</em></h3>
<p>By late October, the trees are nearly bare in the north woods. But in
northwest Illinois, the oaks hang onto their burnt orange and russet
leaves well into November.</p>
<p>It's also a striking landscape, part of the Driftless Area. The
state's high point is near Scales Mound, almost on the border, and
roads follow ridgelines.</p>
<p>From Warren, on Illinois 78 in the northeast corner of Jo Daviess
County, follow Stagecoach Trail past Scales Mound (unfortunately, the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/high-points-midwest/">high point</a> is
privately owned and open to visitors only on first weekends from June
through September) and into historic
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/galena-getaway/">Galena</a>, known as
the home of Ulysses S. Grant.</p>
<p>Galena holds its <a href="https://galenalions.org">Oktoberfest</a> Oct.
1 in 2022, and the <a href="https://www.galenacountryfair.com/">Galena Country
Fair</a> Oct. 8-9 in 2022.</p>
<p>From Galena, take U.S. 20 east to Elizabeth and the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/apple-river-fort-black-hawk/">Apple River
Fort</a>, which tells the story of the day in 1832 when Black Hawk and his band
attacked the town.</p>
<p>Continue east to Stockton or drive six miles north to <a href="https://dnr.illinois.gov/Lands/Landmgt/PARKS/R1/APPLE.HTM">Apple River
Canyon State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>To lengthen your drive, make a loop into the old lead-mining district
just over the border in southwest Wisconsin, from Shullsburg to New
Diggings, Dickeyville and Potosi.</p>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadtrips/wisconsin-potosi-platteville/">Road trip: Southwest

<h2>Wisconsin</h2>
<p>For more great routes, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/rustic-roads/">Wisconsin's Rustic
Roads</a>. Travel Wisconsin
suggests these <a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/article/things-to-do/11-scenic-drives-during-fall">11 scenic
drives</a>.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin River</h3>
<p>Between Merrill and Tomahawk, Wisconsin 107 closely follows the river.</p>
<p>Just west of Merrill, stop in Council Grounds State Park for a hike
along the river. Halfway to Tomahawk, your route crosses the Ice Age
National Scenic Trail  and a gorgeous marsh.</p>
<p>Many tamaracks line this route, so it's a good one to take later in
fall, when the tree's needle-like leaves turn bright yellow.</p>
<p>Another good route along the Wisconsin River is from Prairie du Sac to
Spring Green (and beyond). For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/wisconsin-river-sauk-city-arena-merrimac/">Road trip: Wisconsin
River</a>.</p>
<h3><strong><a href="https://www.holyhill.com/">Holy Hill</a> in the Kettle Moraine</strong></h3>
<p>The first time I heard this mentioned, I thought it was a hill on the
<a href="http://www.iceagetrail.org/">Ice Age National Scenic Trail</a>. The
conical hill is - it's a moulin kame, the highest peak on a chain from
Door County to Madison — but Holy Hill is a basilica, built in 1930.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/a/hartford_holy_hill.jpg" alt="Holy Hill near Hartford." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Holy Hill is built on the highest hill in Wisconsin's Kettle Moraine.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's the Neuschwanstein of Wisconsin, most breathtaking from a
distance. You should see it first from the south, where it rises
majestically from golden corn fields, then drive up the hill, park and
climb the 176 steps up the Scenic Tower.</p>
<p>On a clear day, you'll see Lake Michigan and the Milwaukee skyline, 35
miles to the southeast. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-views-midwest/">15 great fall
views</a>.</p>
<p>If you're there later in October, stop to see the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Holy-Hill-Skeletons-210129962359610/">Holy Hill
Skeletons</a>
Halloween display at 5256 Wisconsin 167.</p>
<p>From County Road K south of Holy Hill, drive east on Shamrock Lane, one
of the four prongs of Rustic Road 33. It winds through a canopy of trees
and over Flynn Creek to Emerald Road. Then head north and onto County
Road CC.</p>
<p>Turn west again on County Road E, then take Kettle Moraine Drive to
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/pikelake/">Pike Lake</a>, a kettle
lake in a state recreation area that's very popular for hiking,
camping, swimming and picnicking.</p>
<h3><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/door-county-fall/">Drives in Door County</a></strong></h3>
<p>On fall weekends, Wisconsin 42 through Egg Harbor, Fish Creek and
Ephraim is packed. So get off the main drag and into the rural, pastoral
interior of this peninsula.</p>
<p>From Ephraim, take County Road Q to the Lake Michigan side and Cana
Island Lighthouse, whose white tower rises at the end of a rocky
causeway.</p>
<p>Just outside Baileys Harbor, Ridges Road leads to Ridges Sanctuary, a
nature refuge marked by the harbor's 1869 lower range light.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/northport_fall_drive.jpg" alt="A winding road in Door County." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Door County, County Road 42 from the ferry landing at Northport is
famously winding.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From Baileys Harbor, take Wisconsin 57 south to Jacksonport, then
Lakeshore Road to Cave Point County Park and Whitefish Dunes State
Park.</p>
<p>Or follow County Road F west to Fish Creek and Peninsula State Park, in
which Shore Road winds past the 1868 Eagle Bluff Lighthouse and wooden
Eagle Tower, which gives everyone who climbs it a panoramic view of
Green Bay, Horseshoe Island and Ephraim.</p>
<p>A more secluded route includes beautiful leaf color along roads at the
&quot;tip of the thumb.&quot;</p>
<p>From Ellison Bay, take Garrett Bay Road to Hedgehog Harbor, just short
of Porte des Morts, or Death's Door. Cottage Road leads to Gills Rock
and joins Wisconsin 42, which ends at the ferry landing in Northport.</p>
<p>From there, Porte des Morts Road leads to Park Lane, which leads to
Weborg Park, a tiny park atop a rocky beach. Heading west, take Park
Drive to Timberline Drive and south to Europe Bay Road.</p>
<p>From there, choose one of three options: head east to Europe Bay beach
in Newport State Park; go south on Newport Drive to a lovely hiking
trail in the Mink River Estuary; or drive west back to Wisconsin 42.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/cable_fall_color_drive.jpg" alt="Fall color along a road near Cable." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In northwest Wisconsin, County Road D south of Grand View keeps its
colors until mid-October.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-cable-wisconsin/">Excursions around Cable</a></strong></h3>
<p>The forests around this sporty town in northwest Wisconsin have one of
the region's most reliable displays of fall color, with tamaracks
supplying golden colors through mid-October.</p>
<p>The town maps out several fall-color routes, some of which cross the
<a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/northcountrytrail">North Country National Scenic
Trail</a> for
hiking and <a href="https://cambatrails.org/">CAMBA trails</a> for mountain biking.</p>
<p>We like to take County Road M east of Cable to Garmisch Road, from which
the two-mile Forest Lodge Nature Trail starts.</p>
<p>From M, County Road D heads north along Namekagon Lake to Grand View,
where there's a statue of Chief Namekagon and a plaque about his
legendary silver mine.</p>
<p>From there, U.S. 63 heads south to Cable, where the Cable Natural
History Museum is worth a visit. Cable's <a href="http://www.cable4fun.com/events/cable-area-fall-fest">Fall
Fest</a> is Sept.
23-24 in 2022.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/wisconsin-waterfalls/">Waterfall watching</a></h3>
<p>In the northwest corner of Wisconsin, the Ice Age left a  string of
mementos — the state's highest waterfalls.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/o/copper_falls_state_park_wis.jpg" alt="Copper Fall State Park in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Travel Wisconsin</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Mellen, Copper Falls State Park features waterfalls and a lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From the port town of Superior, go 15 miles south on Wisconsin 35 to
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/pattison/">Pattison State Park</a>,
where 165-foot Big Manitou Falls is the highest in Wisconsin and the
fourth-highest east of the Rockies.</p>
<p>The 31-foot Little Manitou Falls also is in the park, a mile upstream
along hiking trails.</p>
<p>From Pattison, it's 17 miles to <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/amnicon/">Amnicon Falls State
Park</a>. Take County Road B
east, then County Road K north to South Range, then head east to U.S. 2
and the park, where Upper Falls and Lower Falls ripple along the Amnicon
River.</p>
<p>For more falls, head east to <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/cnnf/recarea/?recid=27749">Morgan
Falls</a> south
of Ashland and <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/copperfalls/">Copper Falls State
Park</a> near Mellen.</p>

<h3><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadtrips/bluff-country-minnesota-fall/">Bluff country byways</a></strong></h3>
<p>Heading south of Rochester on U.S. 52, motorists begin to spot
outcroppings of golden limestone on the face of the hills. Pumpkin
stands pop up along the road, then the buggies of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/guided-trips/amish-tours-minnesota/">Amish</a> women
selling homemade goodies. This is Minnesota's bluff country.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/2240/maps">Historic Bluff Country Scenic
Byway</a> heads east from
Spring Valley through <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/minnesota-caves/">cave
country</a>, to the
bicycling hub of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Lanesboro</a>
and on to Houston and La Crescent on the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>We'd make a loop by heading south of Lanesboro on County Road 21 to
Canton (stop for fresh cashew crunch if you see an Amish stand). From
there, drive east on U.S. 52 to the Norwegian town of <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/spring-grove/">Spring
Grove</a>.</p>
<p>From there, drive south on County Road 16 to Dorchester, Iowa, returning
on 76 go Caledonia.</p>
<p>Or head north of Spring Grove on twisty County Road 4, past Black Hammer
and Yucatan, following the South Fork of the Root to Houston.</p>
<p>There really isn't a road that <em>isn't</em> scenic in this area. If you
have a good map, be adventurous and take any road that strikes your
fancy.</p>

<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/minnesota-north-shore/">Minnesota's North Shore</a></h3>
<p>This is without doubt the most popular fall drive in Minnesota. With
good reason — every mile of this 150-mile route from Duluth to the
Canadian border is scenic. In fact, it's a <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/11185/maps">national
byway</a>.</p>
<p>The colors aren't that great along Lake Superior, and many of the
birches are dying. But the views . . . well, they're to die for.</p>
<p>Add art to the scenery during the <a href="https://grandmaraisartcolony.org/art-along-the-lake-fall-studio-tour/">Art Along the Lake: Fall Studio
Tour</a>
between Schroeder and Hovland, with many stops in Grand Marais. It's

<p>When many people arrive in Duluth, they're fixated on heading up the
North Shore.</p>
<p>But there's a gorgeous drive right in Duluth, 500 feet above Lake
Superior along the ridgeline that once was the edge of Glacial Lake
Duluth.</p>
<p>It's <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/duluth-skyline-drive/">Skyline Parkway</a>, which passes many of Duluth's landmarks. On the west end, you'll get
panoramic views of St. Louis Bay from Ely's Peak and Bardon's Peak,
and you can stop at Spirit Mountain for a ride on the Timber Twister
alpine slide.</p>

<p>In Enger Park, climb the tower or sit in the gazebo to take in a
sweeping view of Canal Park.</p>
<p>At <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/hawk-watching-duluth/">Hawk Ridge</a>,
stop to watch the migration and talk to the naturalists who are there
counting and banding raptors every day in September and October. At the east end, Seven Bridges Road
ends on Superior Street.</p>
<p>On this drive, there's never a dull moment and always a spectacular
view.</p>
<h2>Minnesota and Wisconsin</h2>
<h3><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/st-croix-river-valley-fall/">Colors along the St. Croix</a></strong></h3>
<p>For fall scenery, it's hard to beat the St. Croix River, which forms
the border of the two states.</p>
<p>Start on the Minnesota side in Hastings, at the confluence of the
Mississippi and St. Croix. Drive up County Road 21, past many orchards,
to Afton State Park and the sleepy village of Afton.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/st-croix-valley/historic-stillwater-minnesota/">Stillwater</a>
has a busy downtown filled with shops and hills lined with painted-lady
Victorians.</p>
<p>Follow Minnesota 95 north along the river to Marine on St. Croix and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/taylors-falls-minnesota/">Taylors
Falls</a>, at
the head of the Dalles of the St. Croix.</p>

From Hudson's Prospect Park, there's a great view of the St. Croix
Valley.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On each side of these Dalles — <em>dalle</em>
is French for rocky slab — is a beautiful state park filled with
potholes and boulders on which kids love to climb.</p>
<p>Cross the bridge and continue down the Wisconsin side of the river,
through Osceola and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/hudson-wisconsin-attractions/">Hudson</a>, which
has many shops and restaurants and a lovely riverfront park.</p>
<p>The best time to do this drive is the last full weekend of September. Just
west of Taylors Falls, stop by the 43-acre <a href="https://www.franconia.org/">Franconia Sculpture
Park</a> for the annual Art &amp; Artists
Celebration, in Afton for <a href="http://exploreafton.com/art-in-the-park/">Afton Art in the
Park</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/hudson-shops/">Hudson</a> for the

<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brockway_Mountain_Drive">Brockway Mountain Drive</a> on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/keweenaw-peninsula-michigan/">Keweenaw Peninsula</a></h3>
<p>This nine-mile drive along the raised spine of Michigan's Keweenaw
Peninsula, lined by stonework walls built by the Civilian Conservation
Corps in 1933, is famous for its views of Lake Superior and interior
lakes.</p>
<p>From Eagle Harbor, the drive rises to an overlook, with plaques and gift
shop, then descends into <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/copper-harbor-michigan/">Copper
Harbor</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/o/copper_harbor_lighthouse2.jpg" alt="Copper Harbor Lighthouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Brockway Mountain Drive ends in Copper Harbor and its lighthouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Return on Lakeshore Drive, which is even more scenic. The narrow road
hugs the lake, passing rocky Esrey Roadside Park, Dan's Point and Agate
Beach.</p>
<p>From Eagle Harbor (stop to see the 1871 lighthouse), continue along the
lake, lined by dunes and beaches, to the popular Jampot, Eagle River and
the Sand Hills Lighthouse, now a B&amp;B.</p>
<p>In addition, drive the 18-mile <a href="https://www.keweenaw.info/attractions/scenic-drives/"><strong>Covered
Drive</strong></a> on U.S.
41 from Delaware to Copper Harbor, the state's first Scenic Heritage
Route. Then head for the eastern shore of the peninsula through Lac La
Belle. Soft red and pink sandstone beaches line the road along Oliver
Bay to Gay; pull over and explore for a while.</p>
<p>There's also the unpaved <strong>Covered Road</strong> west of Houghton, through a
tunnel of trees to the ghost town of Redridge and on to Lake Superior.</p>
<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-119_%28Michigan_highway%29">Tunnel of Trees</a></h3>
<p>Across the Mackinac Bridge and south of Mackinaw City, U.S. 31 barrels
straight south, but M-119 follows Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>It's 27½ miles between Harbor Springs and Cross Village on a road
that's twisting and narrow, barely wider than a bicycle trail (and, in
fact, watch for bicyclists). You'll see a few glimpses of the lake, but
mostly you'll see trees, trees and trees.</p>
<p>In Cross Village, have a lunch of Eastern European comfort food at the
<a href="http://www.legsinn.com/">Legs Inn</a>, or pick up a snack at the Good
Hart General Store. Whatever you do, don't hurry.</p>
<p>Want more scenery? Just keep going along Lake Michigan. For details, see
