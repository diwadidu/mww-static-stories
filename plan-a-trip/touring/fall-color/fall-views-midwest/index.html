<h2>From these overlooks, see rolling waves of color light up the landscape.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/holy_hill_steeple_view.jpg" alt="The view from Holy Hill." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The view from Holy Hill reaches to Lake Michigan.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In autumn, the pilgrims head for Holy Hill.</p>
<p>Some want to pay homage to the Blessed Virgin Mary, for whom the
basilica was built in 1930. But many others just want to see the amazing
view, which includes the Milwaukee skyline and surrounding Kettle
Moraine State Forest, dappled with colors.</p>
<p>The basilica was built atop a kame — a mound filled with glacial
rubble — that has one of the highest elevations in southeast Wisconsin
and the highest in the 120-mile-long kettle moraine, where two lobes of
the last glacier collided.</p>
<p>It's one of 15 great overlooks that are easy to reach on a lovely fall
day.</p>
<h3>Holy Hill near Hartford, Wis.</h3>
<p>The view of the basilica's soaring steeples, rising from the treetops,
is nearly as striking as the view from the top of the tower.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Hikers can see it from the Ice Age National Scenic Trail, which winds
through the property. The best view is from the south, where lovely
Rustic Road 33 winds past meadows and through canopies of trees.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.holyhill.com/">basilica</a> is formally known as the
National Shrine of Mary, Help of Christians. It's 178 steps to the top
of the tower, but you can see a view from a deck.</p>
<p>There's a gift shop, a picnic area and a cafe that's open every day
except Monday.</p>
<p>To get there from Hartford, take Wisconsin 83 five miles south, then
Wisconsin 167 three miles east.</p>
<h3>Starved Rock State Park, Utica, Ill.</h3>
<p>In northern Illinois, this park was named for a 125-foot butte along the
Illinois River, where the Potawatomi and Ottawa supposedly trapped a
band of Illini.</p>
<p>Not likely, but the view of the river valley is fabulous from the top of
the limestone rock. Park visitors can see the barges, the locks of the
Illinois Waterway Visitor Center across the river and often bald eagles
— or, lacking those, turkey vultures.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/starved-rock-park-illinois/">Marvels of Starved
Rock</a>.</p>
<h3>Pioneer Park, Stillwater, Minn.</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stillwater_pioneer_park_girl.jpg" alt="Above the St. Croix Valley in Stillwater." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From Stillwater's Pioneer Park, there's a view of the St. Croix
Valley.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This picturesque old logging town on the St. Croix River, just east of
St. Paul, was built on hills. From downtown, head north on Second Street
to Pioneer Park, which has a panoramic view of the river valley,
downtown and the 1931 lift bridge.</p>
<p>There are picnic tables and a playground. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/st-croix-valley/historic-stillwater-minnesota/">Excursion to
Stillwater</a>.</p>
<h3>Prospect Park in Hudson, Wis.</h3>
<p>On the other side of the St. Croix, this leafy park in Hudson is
sheathed in fall colors and affords a pretty, steeple-studded view of
the town below as well as a spectacular view up the river.</p>
<p>To get there from downtown, head up Walnut Street, turn south of Third
Street, go up the hill and turn left on Blakeman Avenue. There's a
picnic table and a swinging bench.</p>
<p>There's another good view from Birkmose Park, off Coulee Road between
downtown and I-94.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/hudson-wisconsin-attractions/">Getaway on the St.
Croix</a>.</p>
<h3>Mississippi Gorge overlook in St. Paul</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_paul_gorge_view.jpg" alt="A view up the Mississippi gorge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In St. Paul, an overlook affords a view of the Mississippi River gorge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The only gorge along the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss">Mississippi River's</a>
entire length runs through the Twin Cities. The best viewpoint on this
heavily wooded stretch, carved by the steady upstream march of St.
Anthony Falls, is at the end of Summit Avenue in St. Paul.</p>
<p>Walk behind the World War I monument to a fenced overlook, then climb
down to a limestone ledge that juts over the bluff. From here, there's
an unobstructed view north toward downtown Minneapolis and south to the
Ford Parkway bridge.</p>
<p>Steep trails lead down to the river, where you can hunt for fossils or
watch rowers, canoeists and kayakers.</p>
<p>It's just south of the Lake Street/Marshall Avenue bridge, along East
River Parkway. There's a small parking area.</p>
<h3>The Mississippi River Valley</h3>
<p>There are too many great panoramas along the river to list here. The
ones that can be reached easily by car include Sorin's Bluff in Red
Wing's Memorial Park (you don't even need to get out of the car here);
Buena Vista Park in Alma, Wis.; Garvin Heights in Winona, Minn.; and
Grandad Bluff in La Crosse.</p>
<p>In Iowa, they include Mount Hosmer City Park in Lansing, Pikes Peak
State Park in McGregor and Eagle Point Park in Dubuque.</p>
<p>For photos and more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mississippi-river-views/">Mississippi
panoramas</a>.</p>
<h3>Rib Mountain in Wausau, Wis.</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wausau_rib_tower.jpg" alt="The view from the Rib Mountain tower." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From the tower in Rib Mountain State Park, there's a panoramic view of
Wausau and the surrounding forest.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This hill, rising from the marshy plains around Wausau and visible from
miles away, looks like something remarkable, if not the state's high
point. It's only the fourth-highest now, at 1,940 feet, though it's the
tallest hill when measured from the plain that surrounds it.</p>
<p>A road winds to the top, where a climb up the 60-foot observation tower
affords one the region's great views from <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/ribmt/">Rib Mountain State
Park</a>. The rocky trails that
wind around the top of the mountain also have good views.</p>
<h3>Timm's Hill near Ogema, Wis.</h3>
<p>This modest hill, six miles east of Ogema off Wisconsin 86, actually is
the highest point in Wisconsin at 1,951½ feet. It's the region's easiest
high point to visit; just drive up to Timm's Hill County Park and walk a
short distance.</p>
<p>For a view of the surrounding treetops, you have to climb an observation
tower.</p>
<p>The area also is a great place for a scenic drive, with Wisconsin's
Rustic Road 62 passing by its feet and Rustic Road 1 just to the south.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/timms-hill/">Trek to Timm's
Hill</a>.</p>
<h3>Devil's Lake State Park in south-central Wisconsin</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_lake_hiker_view.jpg" alt="A hiker at Devil's Lake State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Devil's Lake State Park, the West Bluff Trail takes hikers high
above the lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's hardly a place in this park that doesn't have a view, but walk
along the West Bluff Trail for the easiest and best views of the lake
and surrounding Baraboo Hills.</p>
<p>At overlooks, you'll stand on slabs sof lick pink quartzite, once the
sand at the edge of a red sea. Plaques explain that an ancient river cut
the canyon below but was plugged by debris carried by the last glacier,
causing the rise of the spring-fed lake.</p>
<p>The former riverway still can be seen plainly, stretching into the
horizon.</p>
<p>In fall, this park retains colors into the third week of October. For
more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake/">The divine Devil's
Lake</a>.</p>
<h3>Eagle Bluff in Door County's Peninsula State Park</h3>
<p>Shore Road, which winds through very popular <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/peninsula/">Peninsula State
Park</a> between Fish Creek
and Ephraim, leads to the wooden Eagle Tower.</p>
<p>From it, you'll get a panoramic view of the bay, Horseshoe Island and
Ephraim, its white steeples a gleaming white.</p>
<p>You can also get nice views by hiking the 2-mile Eagle Trail loop from
the overlook or by touring the nearby <a href="https://doorcountyhistoricalsociety.org/eagle-bluff-light-station/">Eagle Bluff
Light</a>, built on the bluff in 1868. In fall, tours are given daily through
mid-October.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/door-county-fall/">Fall in Door County</a>.</p>
<h3>Lake of the Clouds overlook in the Porkies</h3>
<h3></h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porcupines_lake_clouds_fall.jpg" alt="The Porcupines' Lake of the Clouds in autumn." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In fall, Lake of the Clouds in the Porcupines is surrounded by color.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Many people come to Porcupines Mountains Wilderness State Park on
Michigan's Upper Peninsula just to see this view. It's especially
lovely in fall, when the leaves light up in old-growth forest that's
considered the biggest and best of its kind east of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>There's a brief walk from the parking lot to the overlook 300 feet
above Lake of the Clouds, from which the Carp River winds away into the
horizon.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Afoot in the
Porkies</a>.</p>
<h3>Enger Park and Skyline Parkway in Duluth</h3>
<p>There are many spectacular views along <a href="https://superiorbyways.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/duluth-skyline-parkway-print-map.pdf">Skyline
Parkway</a>, a 25-mile Minnesota scenic that follows terraces that once were the
beaches of Glacial Lake Duluth, now Lake Superior.</p>
<p>One of the easiest overlooks to find is Enger Park, where the lighted,
60-foot bluestone Enger Tower is one of Duluth's best-known landmarks.</p>
<p>There's a great 360-foot view from the tower, but also from the rock
outcroppings at the edge of the bluff, just beyond the parking lot.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_enger_boat_view.jpg" alt="View from Duluth's Enger Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From Enger Park, people have a bird's-eye view of boat traffic in the
Duluth harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's a pavilion and benches where you can sit for hours, looking
down at the Aerial Lift Bridge and watching a steady stream of
1,000-foot lakers and oceangoing salties heading into the harbor for
loads of grain, coal and taconite.</p>
<p>For sheer interest, it's rivaled only by Wisconsin's Interstate State
Park and its view of the Dalles of the St. Croix, always crawling with
rock climbers, kayakers and excursion boats.</p>
<p>On the west end of Skyline Parkway, there's another great view from
Bardon's Peak. Visitors can see everything from the St. Louis River to
Lake Superior, including the Oliver Bridge, the former site of the giant
U.S. Steel plant and, directly below, the company town of Morgan Park,
named for tycoon J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>On the east end, there's a panoramic view of Lake Superior and East
Duluth from Hawk Ridge — though this time of year, most people there
are looking up, not out.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/duluth-skyline-drive/">Duluth's Skyline
Parkway</a>.</p>
<h3>Interstate State Park in St. Croix Falls, Wis.</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/a/taylors_falls_view.jpg" alt="Taylors Falls on the St. Croix River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Overlooks in Wisconsin's Interstate State Park include views of the St.
Croix Valley.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From this park's Pothole Trail, the first thing you'll do is look
down. The trail is named for the cylindrical holes drilled into solid
rock by swirling pebbles at the end of the last Ice Age, and they're a
sight to see.</p>
<p>But the action is on and around the St. Croix River. Paddlewheelers
churn to and from Taylors Falls, taking tourists past the Old Man of the
Dalles and Elephant's Head formations.</p>
<p>Canoeists and kayakers paddle the river, and rock climbers scramble up
and down the cliffs on the Wisconsin side.</p>
<p>Tourists cross a rock arch to Angle Rock, where the river makes a sharp
turn that, in 1886, caused a 3-mile-long logjam that took 200 loggers
six weeks to clear.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on the white pines along the river; bald eagles often perch
there.</p>
<p>The best overlooks on the trail are just a few yards from the park
drive. It's also the western trailhead of the Ice Age National Scenic
Trail, which winds 1,000 miles across Wisconsin.</p>

Croix</a>.</p>
<h3>Itasca State Park in northern Minnesota</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_firetower.jpg" alt="The view from Itasca's fire tower." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Climb the fire tower in Minnesota's Itasca State Park for a great view.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In this beloved park, home of the Mississippi River's headwaters, it's
just a short walk on the Aiton Heights trail to the fire tower. There's
a parking lot just off Wilderness Drive.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/itasca-park-tips/">The people's
park</a>.</p>
<h3>Brockway Mountain Drive on the Keweenaw Peninsula</h3>
<p>This nine-mile drive along the raised spine of Michigan's Keweenaw
Peninsula, lined by stonework walls built by the Civilian Conservation
Corps in 1933, is famous for its views of Lake Superior and interior
lakes.</p>
<p>From Eagle Harbor, the drive rises to a wind-whipped overlook, with
plaques and gift shop. Often, you can spot an ore boat on the lake.</p>
<p>There's another overlook just before the drive descends into Copper
Harbor; take a minute to admire the view of Lake Fanny Hooe, the harbor
and the Copper Harbor Lighthouse.</p>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/copper-harbor-michigan/">Copper Harbor
refuge</a>.</p>
