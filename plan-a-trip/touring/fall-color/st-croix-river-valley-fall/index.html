<h2>On fall days, this scenic river valley is dressed to impress.</h2>

From Stillwater's Pioneer Park, there's a view of St. Croix Valley.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On a lovely day in fall, few places show off this region better than the
St. Croix River Valley between Minnesota and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The 52-mile stretch from Taylors Falls to the St. Croix's confluence
with the Mississippi at Prescott has everything a tourist could want —
shops, historic houses, theaters, train excursions, boat cruises.</p>
<p>But mostly, it has scenery — scenery I wanted to show my nieces Alissa
and Livia, who had left Florida to start careers in the Twin Cities. As
it turns out, the St. Croix in autumn looks awfully good to people
raised in Florida.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, look at those trees,&quot; said Livi, who hadn't seen fall color since
she attended grade school in Iowa.</p>
<p>&quot;Do all the trees turn red?&quot; asked her sister, Alissa. &quot;It's so odd,
having to relearn things every schoolchild here knows.&quot;</p>
<p>We started out in Afton State Park, half an hour east of St. Paul,
strolling along the riverfront as cabin cruisers rumbled by and hawks
wheeled overhead. In Afton, we stopped for ice cream.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then we rolled northward into Stillwater, where Main Street was clogged
with tourists strolling from shop to shop.</p>
<p>Downtown cafes were packed, so we bought sandwiches and took them up
Second Street to Pioneer Park, which has a spectacular view of downtown,
the river valley and the 1931 lift bridge.</p>
<p>After driving by some of Stillwater's ornate Victorians, we went on to
Marine on St. Croix, where we took a short hike along the riverfront
trail at William O'Brien State Park.</p>
<p>Just west of Taylors Falls, we explored Franconia Sculpture Park, and
there was no such thing as a quick look — the park was packed with
sculptures, and each led irresistibly to another. We had almost as much
fun as the children who were tearing around the place.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at this, it's a huge playground for us!&quot; said one little girl,
clambering onto an artful tangle of metal called &quot;An Ocean Raft.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/a/taylors_falls_colors.jpg" alt="Fall color in Taylors Falls." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The buildings of Taylors Falls' Angel Hill can be seen from the
opposite side of the river: at left, the First United Methodist Church,
and at right, the historic Folsom House.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Down on the river, it seemed as if the whole world had turned out to
take cruises on St. Croix paddlewheelers and explore the jutting slabs
and giant potholes of Interstate State Park.</p>
<p>The potholes, drilled into solid rock by gravel-laced whirlpools in the
last days of the last Ice Age, are the world's deepest. Near the Devil's
Parlor, a father was descending to the bottom of the 35-foot Bake Oven
with his toddler, who was murmuring &quot;scary, scary, scary&quot; to himself.</p>
<p>Rock climbers had affixed nylon ropes to every possible cliff, and
couples sat arm-in-arm on perches around Angle Rock, where the world's
largest logjam — enough logs to build 20,000 three-bedroom houses —
stopped river traffic for six weeks in 1886.</p>
<p>By then, Livi and Alissa were learning quite a bit about logging, which
made the St. Croix Valley boom in the 1850s. Before we left, I drove
them up Angel Hill to the Folsom House, an 1855 Greek Revival built by a
lumber baron and now owned by the Minnesota Historical Society.</p>
<p>We barely caught our train over in Osceola, Wis., where volunteer train
buffs from the Minnesota Transportation Museum run Osceola &amp; St. Croix
Railway excursion trains.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>As soon as we got on, the 1946 diesel locomotive left the 1916 depot,
pulling seven vintage cars along the river bluffs and then across the
river and through William O'Brien State Park.</p>
<p>We passed beaver lodges and cattail marshes, shady ravines and meadows
full of wildflowers. Back at the depot, children ran along unused tracks
and into an old caboose.</p>
<p>In Osceola, we went downtown to see 25-foot Cascade Falls, a tourist
attraction since the 1880s, then drove down the Wisconsin side of the
St. Croix to Hudson.</p>
<p>Since the turn of the century, Minnesotans have made Hudson a party
town, crossing the border to enjoy various pleasures forbidden at home
— prizefighting, gambling, fireworks, drinking.</p>
<p>Today, however, the saloons in the brick storefronts on Second Street
are being crowded out by new restaurants, espresso cafes and
home-accessories shops.</p>

In Taylors Falls, hiking trails wind along the bluffs in Interstate
State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We walked out onto the city's old toll bridge, now a pedestrian path,
then headed home. We hadn't seen everything on the St. Croix, but we saw
enough local color to impress the ex-Floridians.</p>
<p>&quot;No, we don't have anything like this in Florida,&quot; Livi joked. &quot;Just
palm trees and alligators.&quot;</p>
