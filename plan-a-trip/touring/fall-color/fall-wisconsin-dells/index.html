<p>In the Dells, when the children go home, the adults come out to play.</p>
<p>Autumn is a quiet time in Wisconsin Dells. The outdoor water parks are
closed, many attractions are shuttered and the water-ski show performers
are in Florida for the winter.</p>
<p>In the rush of summer, many tourists spend a whole week in Wisconsin
Dells and never see the dells that drew tourists in the first place.</p>
<p>These sandstone formations, left when an apocalyptic rush of of water
created a 15-mile gorge at the end of the last Ice Age, are especially
striking in the warm light of fall. So are the forests.</p>
<p>There are hiking trails in the Dells, and paddling, too. There are even
log cabins with fireplaces.</p>
<p>One October, we traveled to the Dells with friends to stay in one and
catch the fall scenery.</p>

<h3>Hiking at <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/mirrorlake/">Mirror Lake State Park</a></h3>
<p>My friend Debra and I took off early Friday and made a beeline to Mirror
Lake. Named because it's so calm, the serpentine lake lies in a gorge
created by Dell Creek, which flows north through Lake Delton and into
the Wisconsin River.</p>
<p>It's a kind of junior Dells, with 50-foot sandstone bluffs along its
shores. We walked across a footbridge and onto the 2½-mile Northwest
Trail, which follows the shoreline.</p>
<p>The terrain was lumpy, a tell-tale remnant of a glacier, and we were
surrounded by the warm hues of maples and oaks just past peak.</p>
<p>We wanted to get a glimpse of the <a href="http://www.sethpeterson.org/">Seth Peterson
Cottage</a>, which overlooks the lake and
was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, but it's <a href="http://www.sethpeterson.org/about_tours.html">open to the
public</a> only on the second
Sunday of each month.</p>
<p>&quot;Even I don't get to go there,&quot; said park manager Rebecca Green.
&quot;When you pay $300 a night, you get all 13 acres to yourself.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_pumpkin_decorating.jpg" alt="Pumpkin decorating in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The park also is a paddling destination. The lake is more like a river,
with the wide part near the boat landing and a narrow, cliff-lined
passageway leading to grassy meadows and wetlands in the west side of
the park.</p>
<h3>A <a href="http://www.birchcliff.com">log cabin in the woods</a></h3>
<p>There aren't a lot of traditional cabin resorts left in the Dells, but
Birchcliff Resort is one of them. It's run by a young couple, Dailene
and Joseph Malacina.</p>
<p>&quot;We tend to attract families looking for more than a water park,&quot;
Dailene said. &quot;It's just a relaxing getaway in a more natural setting.
If this is their thing, they come back year after year.&quot;</p>
<p>Their resort is on a wooded hill along River Road, just north of
downtown, and it includes newer and older cabins and the original lodge.
Our newer cabin had a wood-burning fireplace, so we built a fire, opened
a bottle of wine and made ourselves a spaghetti dinner.</p>
<p>The next morning, we made breakfast burritos and walked through the
resort grounds and onto a path through the woods. As we walked, we heard
tooting from across the river that sounded more like a toy train than a
freight train.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mirror_lake_debra.jpg" alt="Hiking in Mirror Lake State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Mirror Lake State Park has 17 trails, mostly short.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The path ended at a beach, part of the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=283">Dells of the Wisconsin
River</a>
state natural area, whose parking lot is just down the hill from the
resort.</p>
<p>Sugar-sand cliffs line the shore here, and as we soaked in the sun, an
excursion boat headed for the Upper Dells, crossing paths with a fishing
boat going downstream.</p>
<p>We climbed back on a rolling path covered with leaves.</p>
<h3>A fall festival</h3>
<p>The annual Autumn Harvest Fest was going on downtown, so we headed down
to take a look. Crafters and artisans were set up under rows of white
tents gleaming in the sun.</p>
<p>Small pumpkins that children had festooned with cartoonish decals were
displayed on bleachers, and ponies patiently plodded in circles with
pint-sized cargoes.</p>
<p>Later, there would be a scarecrow-stuffing contest, a pumpkin ring toss,
a juggler and a straw dig for kids, all free.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_birchcliff_cabin.jpg" alt="Birchcliff Resort in the Dells." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Along River Road, Birchcliff Resort offers an assortment of cabins.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But the people already forming a line at the entrance to a big tent were
waiting for something else.</p>
<p>The Dells on Tap beer festival was that afternoon, and experienced
drinkers had arrived with pretzel necklaces. The serious drinkers also
had stuck string cheese, Slim Jims and Snickers bars onto their
necklaces, and they all  looked raring to go.</p>
<h3>Hiking in <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake/">Devil's Lake State Park</a></h3>
<p>We've hiked at Devil's Lake State Park many times, but it would be a
crime to visit Wisconsin Dells in fall and not go there.</p>
<p>It's Wisconsin's most-visited state park, but the crowds come in
summer, mainly for the beach and to camp.</p>
<p>Hiking is best in fall, when a walk on the cliffs 500 feet above the
lake supply impressive views and, if you like geology, a <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake-geology/">dramatic
story</a> of
volcanoes, a red ocean and 50-foot waves.</p>
<p>This one place tells the entire story of this area. An ancient river cut
the canyon but was plugged by debris carried by the last glacier. It
caused the rise of the spring-fed lake, often called the state's
clearest.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_beach_sna.jpg" alt="Dells of the Wisconsin River natural area." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In the Dells of the Wisconsin River natural area, trails lead to a
beach.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>One fall, we walked 10 miles from the East Bluff Trail, past Balanced
Rock and the Devil's Doorway, to Parfrey's Glen, which became the
state's first natural area in 1952.</p>
<p>This time, we walked the less-strenuous West Bluff Trail, pausing to
take in the views. On the other side of the lake, we could see the
former riverway stretching into the horizon.</p>
<p>We made a 2½-mile loop by returning on the Tumbled Rocks Trail, picking
our way through a field of 800-ton quartzite boulders, many gleaming
pink in the afternoon fun.</p>
<p>Then we drove over to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150426658780129.413397.104777055128&amp;type=3">Parfrey's
Glen</a>. Once it had boardwalks, but the DNR has returned this otherwordly
little gorge to its natural state, and visitors seemed to enjoy jumping
from rock to rock instead of treading wooden planks.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>A group of Illinois college students were there on a geology field trip.
Like everyone else, they were fascinated by the walls of
plum-puddingstone — globes of quartzite embedded in sandstone — and
the skein of water cascading down the far cliff.</p>
<p>We also couldn't resist a return visit to Pewit's Nest state natural
area. It's an even narrower gorge, a mere slit covered by a canopy of
cedar, hemlock and birch.</p>
<p>In fall, colorful leaves blanket the dozens of tiny terraces that form
its moist walls and also the pool of black water at its mouth.</p>
<p>All three parks are described in our <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/best-hikes-ice-age-trail/">Greatest hits of the Ice
Age</a>
story.</p>
<h3>A train in the woods</h3>
<p>We finally figured out where the tooting was coming from. Farther up the
river, near Stand Rock, the narrow-gauge <a href="http://www.randgn.com/">Riverside &amp; Great Northern
Railway</a> offers rides in tiny cars pulled by a
small but real steam locomotive.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_lake_lauren.jpg" alt="A view in Devil's Lake State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>During World War II, an American GI named Elmer Sandley was stationed in
Europe and was impressed by the narrow-gauge railways hauling people up
and around mountains.</p>
<p>When he got back, he founded the Sandley Light Railway Equipment Works,
and he and his son, Norman, built rolling stock for hundreds of
amusement parks.</p>
<p>Today, the railway is a labor of love, completely run by volunteers.
They stoke the locomotive's boiler for two hours in the morning, make
burgers and popcorn in the sunny little cafe and take kids to pumpkin
patches in the woods.</p>
<p>It's a charming complex, with a depot, gift shop and museum plus water
tank, roundhouse and joinery. And for the Dells, it's shockingly
low-key and non-commercial.</p>
<p>On second thought, the Dells in fall may or not be for adults. Since
there's a kid still inside all of us, it's a little hard to tell.</p>
