<p>Fall is made for festivals. It's harvest time, and the fields and
orchards are overflowing. Trees turn red and gold. And it's the last
time we'll enjoy warm weather until spring.</p>
<p>The many people who heed the urge to get out and about on crisp autumn
weekends make it the busiest tourist season of the year.</p>
<p>Any town that can hold a fall festival does, and well-established ones,
such as Bayfield's Apple Festival (see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/bayfield-fall-apple-fest/">Big
apples</a>),
become almost too popular.</p>
<p>Other festivals also attract big crowds — Cranberry Fest in
west-central Wisconsin, the Fall Art Tour in southwest Wisconsin — and
people who haven't reserved lodgings may not be able to get them.</p>
<p>All Oktoberfest celebrations are popular; for a list, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/oktoberfests-in-midwest/">Toasting
Oktoberfest</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But small festivals also attract a lot of people, and leaf-peepers will
be out en masse in the north woods and along the St. Croix and
Mississippi rivers; see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/midwest-fall-drives/">Great fall
drives</a>.</p>
<p>Many people combine scenic drives with artist tours; see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/art-fairs/midwest-fall-art-tours/">Autumn in the
studios</a>.</p>
<p>So if you want to travel in fall, plan ahead.</p>
<p>Here are the best fall fests in <em>2022.</em></p>
<p>Before you go, check to verify dates and to make sure you catch the best
parts of a festival, especially the parades.</p>
<p>For festivals you can combine with a bike ride, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/fall-festivals-bike-trails/">Bash on a bike
trail</a>.</p>
<p>For events year-round, see the <a href="/events/">Events
