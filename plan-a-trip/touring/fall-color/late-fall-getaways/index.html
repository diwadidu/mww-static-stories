<p>Late fall — when crowds fade and hotel deals appear — is one of the
best times to make a getaway.</p>
<p>For hikers, it's the sweet spot between the fall-color rush and hunting
season. For shoppers, it's the time to get a head start on the
holidays, before the craziness starts.</p>
<p>More often than not, the weather still is gorgeous, and stubborn oaks
and willows offer color that lasts into the middle of November.</p>
<p>The more popular a destination is in summer, the more likely you'll
find great hotel deals in late October and November.</p>
<p>Here are 15 great places to go for a late-fall getaway.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h2>Wisconsin</h2>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/walking-lake-geneva/">Lake Geneva</a></h3>
<p>Sure, there's a lot of shopping, but the most fun thing to do here is
walk the 21-mile lakeshore path, which passes through the front yards of
Gilded Age mansions. Roses, hydrangea and snapdragons bloom throughout
October.</p>
<p>If weather is good, go horseback-riding or ride a zip line. If it's not
so good, go on one of the free Saturday tours of the Yerkes Observatory,
which has the world's largest refracting telescope.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.grandgeneva.com">Grand Geneva Resort</a> offers haunted hay
rides and trail rides from its stables, and its Timber Ridge Lodge has a
small but nice indoor water park.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/summer-milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a></h3>
<p>Big cities always are great to visit in late fall, when their cultural
seasons are in high gear. I first visited Milwaukee in early November,
when willows along the lakeshore still were bright gold.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_geneva_carriage.jpg" alt="Lake Geneva in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A horse-drawn carriage takes tourists around Lake Geneva.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>People thronged the sidewalks, along Jefferson Street near Cathedral
Square, in the Historic Third Ward, around the Milwaukee Bucks arena and
on Old World Third Street.</p>
<p>Downtown, people were converging on the gold doors of the Pabst Theater
and at the Riverside Theater. I wanted to hear the Milwaukee Symphony
Orchestra play Beethoven's Ninth at the Marcus Center, but it was sold
out.</p>
<p>Milwaukee was just like a little Chicago — except it was easy to find
free or cheap parking.</p>
<p>There are also many fun places in the countryside between Milwaukee and
Lake Geneva to visit in late fall: Mukwonago and East Troy, for rides on
the <a href="http://www.easttroyrr.org/">East Troy Electric Railroad</a>, <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/old-world-wisconsin-christmas/">Old
World
Wisconsin</a>
near Eagle; and <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/ten-chimneys-wisconsin/">Ten
Chimneys</a>
in Genessee Depot.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-madison/">Madison</a></h3>
<p>Thanks to Badgers football, the very air of this college town pulses
with excitement on fall weekends. Hotel rates skyrocket for home games,
however, so  you may want to avoid those weekends if you're not going
to the game.</p>
<p>It's a great town for shopping, in the museum shops and offbeat stores
on State Street and in the global boutiques along Monroe Street.
There's always a concert, play or traveling Broadway show at the
Overture Center.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://dcfm.org/markets/saturday-on-the-square">Dane County Farmers
Market</a> on Capitol Square runs Saturdays through mid-November, then moves into Monona Terrace for the <a href="https://dcfm.org/markets/holiday-market">Holiday
Market</a>.</p>
<p>There are two big indoor arts markets in November, the <a href="http://www.artcraftwis.org/winter-art-fair-off-the-square.html">Winter Art Fair
Off the
Square</a>
at Monona Terrace and the <a href="https://www.mmoca.org/event/art-and-gift-fair-weekends-at-mmoca/">Art &amp; Gift
Fair</a>
at the Madison Museum of Contemporary Art.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_cruise_boat_fall.jpg" alt="Dells Boat Tours." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Wisconsin Dells, tour boats cruise the river and venture into haunted
canyons.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-wisconsin-dells/">Wisconsin Dells</a></h3>
<p>The indoor water parks know all about the Minnesota school break, so you
won't find deals there until after the third weekend in October.</p>
<p>But you can stay at a log cabin at Birchcliff Resort and hike through
woods down to the Wisconsin River. You can go out on daily <a href="http://www.dellsboats.com/">Dells Boat
Tours</a> until the end of  October, and on
weekends there are <a href="http://dellsghostboat.com/">Ghost Boat</a> tours into
haunted canyons.</p>
<p>And little kids will adore the narrow-gauge <a href="http://www.randgn.com/">Riverside &amp; Great Northern
Railway</a>, which runs through the woods through
October and on Thanksgiving weekend.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/door-county-fall/">Door County</a></h3>
<p>The crowds fade away by the end of October, but the Door Peninsula stays
warmer than the rest of Wisconsin and keeps its fall color longer,
thanks to Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>Visit the eight wineries on the Door County Wine Trail, pick up goodies
at a farm market or hike in five state parks and 28 state natural areas.
In Fish Creek, <a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/events/fairs-festivals/jack-olantern-days-40340">Jack 'O Lantern
Days</a>
is the last weekend in October.</p>

<h2>Illinois</h2>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/">Chicago</a></h3>
<p>Like Milwaukee, Chicago is on Lake Michigan, whose waters keep the
cities warm for a few weeks longer than the rest of the region.</p>
<p>Hotel rates drop precipitously after the Chicago Marathon on the second
weekend of October, but watch for big conventions that goose the rates
upward.</p>
<p>This city is fun any time of year, but
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/halloween/chicago-halloween-festivals/">Halloween</a>
is a huge deal.</p>
<p>In November, go on a <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/chicago-restaurant-food-tours/">food
tour</a>
or one of the Chicago Architecture Foundation's <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/chicago-architecture/">walking
tours</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/a/galena_nouveau_reveler.jpg" alt="A reveler at Galena wine weekend." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Galena CVB</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A reveler enjoys Galena's Nouveau Wine Weekend.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/galena-getaway/">Galena</a></h3>
<p>This is a classic <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/girlfriend-getaways/girlfriend-getaways-november/">girlfriend-getaway
destination</a>. You can barely find a room in September and early October, when the
town holds several big festivals, but crowds ease later on.</p>
<p>There's still a lot going on, especially over Halloween, when there's
a parade, and for <a href="https://nouveauweekend.com/">Nouveau Wine Weekend</a> on
the weekend before Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>And late fall is a good time to drive in the countryside, especially the
ridges east of town, which are lined with oaks that retain their leaves
well into November.</p>
<h2>Minnesota</h2>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/">Northfield</a></h3>
<p>This college town is much quieter, though the St. Olaf-Carlton football
game generates some excitement. Carlton's stadium is right next to its
Arboretum, a lovely place to hike in late fall, when the gnarled
branches of oaks show black against the sky.</p>
<p>There's a nice selection of small, independent shops on Division Street
downtown. And there's always a free concert to attend at St. Olaf
College, which is world-renowned for its music program.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/split_rock_fall.jpg" alt="Split Rock Lighthouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Every Nov. 10, Split Rock Lighthouse on Minnesota's North Shore
commemorates the sinking of the Edmund Fitzgerald.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/north-shore-late-fall/">North Shore</a></h3>
<p>This part of Lake Superior is beloved year-round, almost too much during
summer and peak fall color. But certain people love it just as much in
late fall, when skies turn threatening and the gales of November whip
giant waves against the shore.</p>
<p>That's when you'll want to rent a <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/winter-cabins-minnesota-wisconsin/">cozy
cabin</a>
with a big stone fireplace and a picture window.</p>
<p>Since most of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">Superior Hiking
Trail</a> is
closed for the firearms deer season in early November, we like to go
between the Minnesota school break over the third weekend of October and
the start of hunting in early November.</p>
<p>After that, during hunting season, hike instead on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/superior-hiking-trail-duluth/">Superior Hiking
Trail in
Duluth</a>, where you also can watch salties and ore boats coming and going.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_minnehaha_falls_fall.jpg" alt="Minnehaha Falls in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Lauren Gagner</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Minneapolis, stop by Minnehaha Park to see the falls.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/minneapolis-riverfront/">Minneapolis</a></strong></h3>
<p>You can't get bored here, especially if you're a fan of craft beer or
fine art. There are dozens of <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/breweries-twin-cities/">craft
breweries</a>
in Minneapolis alone, with even more in the metro area. There's a
cluster in northeast Minneapolis, which hosts the giant <a href="http://www.northrupkingbuilding.com/artattack/">Art
Attack</a> festival the
first weekend of November.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://hennepintheatretrust.org/events/">downtown theater
district</a>, go to a Broadway
musical or see a famous performer.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/st-croix-valley/historic-stillwater-minnesota/">Stillwater</a></h3>
<p>This pretty town along the St. Croix River is a favorite weekend
destination for Twin Citians.</p>
<p>It's best known for its shopping, especially antiques and antiquarian
books, and for the painted-lady Victorians that line its hills. But
it's also got a wineries and breweries to visit and trolley tours to
take.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/traverse_city_fustinis.jpg" alt="Front Street in Traverse City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

breweries.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h2>Michigan</h2>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Traverse City</a></h3>
<p>The great thing about beach towns is that they're packed in summer —
leaving lots of hotel rooms for the contrarians who come in late fall.</p>
<p>There's still a ton to do, but even so, this town on Lake Michigan
offers <a href="http://www.traversecity.com/fab-fall-packages-485/">fall
specials</a> from Labor
Day to mid-December.</p>
<p>Get one and use your weekend to tour local breweries or follow the wine
trails on the <a href="http://www.lpwines.com/">Leelanau</a> and <a href="http://www.wineriesofoldmission.com/">Old
Mission</a> peninsulas.</p>
<p>Tasting tours on the Leelanau wine trail are the first two weekends of
November, and <a href="http://www.traversecity.com/tcbw/">Traverse City Beer
Week</a> in mid-November.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.southhavenarts.org">South Haven</a></h3>
<p>Here's another beach town that still wants you to visit. Walk along
Lake Michigan or the Black River, drive to nearby vineyards or ride the
34-mile <a href="https://kalhaven.org/trail-map/">Kal-Haven Trail</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/m/amanas_winery.jpg" alt="Pouring fruit wines in Amana." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Ackerman Winery in Amana, Barb Kellenberger pours samples of fruit
wine.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Throughout October, the downtown is filled with spooky displays for the <a href="https://www.southhaven.org/downtown-south-haven-skeleton-stroll-2022">Skeleton Stroll</a>.</p>
<h2>Iowa</h2>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/amana-colonies/">Amana</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/kalona-iowa-amish-organics/">Kalona</a></h3>
<p>In the rolling hills of southeast Iowa, plain-living and religiously
devout German immigrants created two communities that contrast with the
nearby college town of Iowa City.</p>
<p>The Amana Colonies, where people lived communally until 1932, are the
best known. Today, the towns are a destination for shoppers, who also
come to sample fruit wines, eat large family-style meals, learn about
the history and see productions at two theaters.</p>
<p>You won't find any Amish around Amana, but you will in Kalona. Learn
about them at the Kalona Historical Village or go see them at their
shops in the countryside (but not on Sundays).</p>
