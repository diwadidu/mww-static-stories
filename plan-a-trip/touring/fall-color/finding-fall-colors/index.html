<h2>With luck, leaf peepers can squeeze seven weeks of color out of fall.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/b/oberg_fall_colors2.jpg" alt="Fall colors on Oberg Mountain." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Minnesota's North Shore, everyone hopes to catch fall colors like
these around Oberg Mountain.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>As anyone who's ever planned a fall trip knows, peak leaf color can be
elusive.</p>
<p>Betting on a burst of spectacular color is like plugging nickels into a
slot machine. To win, all of the figures have to line up: the right
number of warm days and cool nights, the right levels of sugar produced,
the right amounts of moisture.</p>
<p>Predictions always are chancy. What experts look for are summer rains
that give trees plenty of moisture, and sunny days that are warm but not
hot enough to stress trees.</p>
<p>Throw in a few chilly nights in the first part of September, and you've
got the recipe for vivid and long-lasting color, with luminous orange
maples and deep-scarlet oaks that can last right up to November.</p>
<p>In 2022, it was hot and dry in some areas and normally rainy in others, so check by region. But in the north woods, colors seem to be arriving at least a week later than last year.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>You never know in advance what you're going to see. The only sure-fire
way to increase the odds of seeing peak color is by placing more bets
— that is, by moving around.</p>
<p>In this region, leaf color lasts for about seven weeks — eight, if you
count the sumac that turns red in early September.</p>
<p>Maples turn first, then aspen. Tamarack needles in northern bogs provide
a late wave of yellow and gold, and rusty-red oak leaves stay on trees
into November.</p>
<p>Late September is peak in the inland forests — Chippewa and Superior
national forests in Minnesota, Chequamegon and Nicolet in Wisconsin,
Ottawa and Hiawatha in the Upper Peninsula — and it comes a week later
along the shoreline of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Leaves turn later the farther south you go, except on such peninsulas as
Door County, wrapped by the heat-retaining waters of Lake Michigan.
There, peak may come as late as the third weekend in October.</p>
<p>In southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois, oaks turn warm shades of
cinnamon and ocher and often keep their leaves well into November. I've
seen pleasing pockets of late color on the ridges around Galena and
along the Wisconsin River valley.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porcupines_lake_clouds_fall.jpg" alt="The Porcupines' Lake of the Clouds in autumn." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In fall, the view of Lake of the Clouds from the Porcupines' Escarpment
Trail is spectacular.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Milwaukee, willows along Lake Michigan can remain a glowing gold into
the second weekend of November. Ginkgo trees also supply a late splash
of yellow.</p>
<p>State and national forests have the largest diversity of species, so
their display of color lasts longer. In Chequamegon National Forest
around Cable, I've seen solid color from late September to the middle of
October, when the tamaracks stage their last hurrah.</p>
<p>Even if you're too early, you'll see lots of sumac, plus red dogwood and
maroon Virginia creeper. And you'll catch prairie grasses and
wildflowers at peak — bluestem and blazing star, aster, blue vervain
and goldenrod.</p>
<p>If you're too late, you still might see lots of vivid red in the north
woods, if it's been a good year for mountain-ash berries.</p>

<p>On Minnesota's North Shore, the
rangers at Superior National Forest write a lovely <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/superior/recreation/scenicdrivinginfo/?cid=FSEPRD558148">fall-color
blog</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iowadnr.gov/Environment/Forestry/ForestryLinksPublications/FallColor.aspx">Iowa</a>,
<a href="https://www.enjoyillinois.com/plan-your-trip/seasonal-adventures/fall-travel-in-illinois/illinois-fall-color-report/">Illinois</a>
and the <a href="https://www.uptravel.com/recreation/fall-color-routes/fall-color-reports/">Upper
Peninsula</a>
post fall-color reports from mid-September.</p>
<p>And if you wonder what causes fall color, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-foliage-color-changes/">What makes leaves turn
color?</a></p>
<h3>Third week of September</h3>
<p>You should see the start of fall color in the northwoods, mostly in
sumacs, wildflowers and prairie grasses.</p>
<p>If you're itching to go for a fall drive, explore <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/rustic-roads/">Wisconsin's Rustic
Roads</a>. For a chance at seeing fall
color, try the 12-mile RR 60 between <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/boulder-junction/">Boulder
Junction</a>
and Star Lake in <em>northeast Wisconsin</em> lakes country.</p>
<p>In <em>northeast Minnesota</em> , drive the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/gunflint-trail/">Gunflint
Trail</a>
and the inland forests of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/">North
Shore</a>, especially between the
Caribou and Sawbill trails around Lutsen, where there are many sugar
maples.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mississippi_gorge_fall.jpg" alt="The Mississippi Gorge in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Trees are reflected on the Mississippi River in the Twin Cities the
second week of October.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Fourth week/end of September</h3>
<p>This is when serious color, the coveted reds and oranges, really starts
to glow in inland forests up north. It'll be a good time to go
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/marinette-waterfalls/">waterfall-hunting</a>
in Nicolet National Forest in <em>northeast Wisconsin</em> , around Florence
and Marinette.</p>
<p>The <em>Upper Peninsula of Michigan</em> has perhaps the best color of all; the
inland trees should be vivid in the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Porcupines</a>, around Ironwood and in Ottawa National Forest east of Ironwood.</p>
<p>By the end of the month, there should be good color in <em>north-central
Minnesota</em> , where <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/itasca-park-tips/">Itasca State
Park</a> is a favorite
spot to hike and bike.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/brainerd-lakes-Minnesota-fall/">Brainerd Lakes</a> area, check
out hardwood forests and walk the trails of the 540-acre <a href="http://northlandarb.org/">Northland
Arboretum</a>. It's the southern trailhead of
the Paul Bunyan State Trail, which, like all <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/best-bicycle-trails-fall/">bicycle
trails</a>, is a good place to spot color.</p>
<p>From a car, take in the colors from one of <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/minnesota-scenic-byways/">Minnesota's scenic
byways,</a> such as the
54-mile <a href="https://paulbunyanscenicbyway.org/">Paul Bunyan</a> north of
Brainerd or the 47-mile <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/2455/maps">Edge of the
Wilderness</a>
out of Grand Rapids.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/r/crosby_bike_tour.jpg" alt="Two bicyclists pedal on the Tour de Cuyuna in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
There's a wide range of color in the mixed hardwood forest of
Minnesota's Brainerd Lakes area.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Color also will be showing in the inland maple forests on <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-colors-north-shore/"><strong>Minnesota's
North Shore</strong></a> ; two of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">best
hikes</a> to see
it are the Bean/Bear lakes loop from Silver Bay and the Oberg Mountain
loop near Tofte.</p>
<p>But be sure to reserve
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/north-shore-lodgings/">lodgings</a> up to a
year in advance, because this area is very popular in fall.</p>
<h3>First week of October</h3>
<p>The marquee spots in the north woods should hit peak by the end of this
week. The <em>northwest Wisconsin</em> town of <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-in-cable/">Cable</a> is
one of the region's best places to see it; stop by the chamber of
commerce or the <a href="http://www.cablemuseum.org">Cable Natural History
Museum</a> to pick up a map of three fall-color
driving routes on marked roads.</p>
<p>It's also a great place to hike; try the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/cnnf/recarea/?recid=27747">Forest Lodge Nature
Trail</a> east
of Cable, the <a href="https://northcountrytrail.org/trail/wisconsin/che/">North Country National Scenic
Trail</a> past Rainbow
and Porcupine lakes and the trail to <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/%21ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTJw8jAwjQL8h2VAQAzHJMsQ%21%21/?ss=110913&amp;navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;cid=FSE_003693&amp;navid=100000000000000&amp;pnavid=null&amp;position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;recid=27749&amp;ttype=recarea&amp;pname=Chequamegon-Nicolet%20National%20Forest%20-%20Morgan%20Falls%20St.%20Peter%60s%20Dome%20Trail">Morgan Falls and St. Peter's
Dome</a>.</p>
<p>In <strong>Michigan</strong> 's
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Porcupines</a>, the Escarpment Trail from Lake of the Clouds should be gorgeous.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_river_rowers.jpg" alt="Rowing on the Mississippi." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In October, rowers glide through the Mississippi River gorge in
Minneapolis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Along the Presque Isle River on the other side of the park, old-growth
hemlocks will provide a dark-green counterpoint to turning trees around
Manabezho, Manido and Nawadaha falls.</p>
<p>Color still should be good along <em>Minnesota's North Shore</em> .</p>
<h3>Second week of October</h3>
<p>In the <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/twin-cities/">Twin Cities</a></strong> , colors
brighten in the Mississippi River gorge between Minneapolis and St.
Paul, just in time for the Twin Cities Marathon.</p>
<p>In central Wisconsin, the woods along the Wisconsin River — around
Wausau, Merrill and Tomahawk — will be glowing. Plan a hiking trip on
the Ice Age National Scenic Trail around <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/ice-age-trail/">Timm's
Hill</a>, the highest
point in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Lake Superior keeps the towns on its shores a little warmer, so
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/bayfield-summer-wisconsin/">Bayfield</a></strong>
and
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/ashland-wisconsin/">Ashland</a></strong>
should be at peak this week.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/guttenberg_fall_colors.jpg" alt="Fall colors in Guttenberg." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In northeast Iowa, Guttenberg's city park is lined with maples.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In <em>eastern Minnesota</em> , state parks along the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/st-croix-fall/">St. Croix
River</a> — Banning, Wild River, Interstate, William
O'Brien — still should look bright.</p>
<p>Along the Mississippi in <em>southeast Minnesota</em> , <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/great_river_bluffs/index.html">Great River Bluffs
State
Park</a>
near Winona has five overlooks; try a hike to Kings Bluff on Kings Bluff
Nature Trail.</p>
<p>Just to the west, the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/bluff-country-minnesota-fall/">bluff country</a>
around
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Lanesboro</a>
and Harmony will be glowing gold. Drive there on Minnesota 16 from La
Crescent, which follows the Root River and is known as the <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/2240/maps">Historic
Bluff Country Scenic
Byway</a>.</p>
<p>On the <em>southwest Wisconsin</em> side of the Mississippi, bird-watchers
should get an eyeful by going bicycling on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/great-river-trail/">Great River State
Trail</a>,
which starts in Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge and heads south to
Onalaska through the the bottomlands of the Upper Mississippi River
Wildlife and Fish Refuge.</p>
<p>And <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/northeast-Iowa-fall/">northeast Iowa</a> should be beautiful, as
usual. Climb the bluffs above Marquette to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/efmo">Effigy Mounds National
Monument</a>, where 11 miles of hiking trails
wind through oak and aspen forest on the rim of the bluff, affording
spectacular <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mississippi-river-views/">views of the Mississippi River
Valley</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The wheelchair-accessible Boardwalk Trail goes to the Yellow River
bridge and has good views of fall color to the north and south.</p>
<p>Not far south, past <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mcgregor-iowa/">McGregor</a>, Guttenberg has a mile-long city park lined with maples that turn a
brilliant orange.</p>
<h3>Third week of October</h3>
<p><a href="https://admin.midwestweekend.com/plan_a_trip/touring/fall_color/door_county_fall.html">Door
County</a>
should hit peak this week, with the most color along the Green Bay side
of the peninsula and along inland roads, such as County Road Q from
Baileys Harbor to Ephraim and County Road F from Baileys Harbor to Fish
Creek.</p>
<p>For hiking, try heavily wooded Ellison Bluff Park, on the headlands just
west of Ellison Bay, and the <a href="http://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/regions/northamerica/unitedstates/wisconsin/placesweprotect/mink-river-estuary.xml">Mink River
Estuary</a>, between the village and Rowleys Bay.</p>
<p>Door County has 28 <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/NaturalAreas/county.html#Door">state natural
areas</a> ;
try <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=543">Logan
Creek</a>
south of Jacksonport, which has many sugar maples. While you're there,
visit Cave Point County Park, just across Clark Lake on Lake Michigan.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_lake_fall_colors.jpg" alt="Fall colors at Devil's Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In south-central Wisconsin, colors in Devil's Lake State Park stay
vibrant into mid-October.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>By now, the colors will be mostly yellows. Some years, colors show up
late at <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake/">Devil's Lake State
Park</a> in
<em>south-central Wisconsin</em> ; one year, the northern entrance was
enveloped in yellows so bright I needed sunglasses.</p>
<p>In the north woods, most of the color will be yellow. In boggy areas
across <em>northern Wisconsin</em> , especially in Chequamegon-Nicolet National
Forest, tamaracks will be at peak and glowing gold.</p>
<p>The tamarack looks like an evergreen, but it's a deciduous conifer
whose needles turn color just before they drop.</p>
<p>On hiking trails, color will be on the forest floor instead of overhead.
That makes one trail in particular even more scenic when leaves fall:
the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/best-hikes-ice-age-trail/">Ice Age National Scenic
Trail</a>,
which winds 1,000 miles through Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Without the full forest canopy and underbrush, hikers can see what the
Wisconsin Glacier left when it retreated: a lumpy quilt of conical
hills, high ridges and long hillocks called kames, drumlins and eskers.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/o/tomahawk_wetland.jpg" alt="Wisconsin 107 between Merrill and Tomahawk." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In mid-October, a marsh along the Wisconsin River near Tomahawk glows.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Stretches go through some of Wisconsin's most scenic areas: the <em>Blue
Hills</em> near Rice Lake, Chequamegon National Forest in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/ice-age-trail/">Taylor
County</a>, the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/wisconsin-muir-tour/">Baraboo
Hills</a> near
Wisconsin Dells and the Kettle Moraine in <em>southeast Wisconsin</em> .</p>
<p>In <em>northern Illinois</em> , this is Fall Colors Weekend at <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/starved-rock-park-illinois/">Starved Rock
State
Park</a>
along the Illinois River, where oaks provide much of the color.</p>
<p>For other nice displays this week, try <em>Door County</em> and the Mississippi
River Valley between <em>northeast Iowa</em> and <em>southwest Wisconsin</em> .</p>
<h3>Fourth week of October</h3>
<p>Places that have a lot of oaks still will be showing beautiful hues of
bronze, cinnamon and russet.</p>
<p>One year, I spent this weekend in <em>southeast Minnesota</em> 's <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/whitewater/index.html">Whitewater
State
Park</a> and
was amazed by the widespread color on the bluffs, set off here and there
by the greens of red cedar.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_mountain_ash_berries.jpg" alt="Mountain ash berries in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Mountain-ash berries provide bits of color when leaves are gone.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Another year, I saw lovely tawny colors around
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/galena-getaway/">Galena</a> on the ridges
of <em>northwest Illinois</em> , which has many oaks.</p>
<p>This is a good time to get in an early shopping trip to scenic areas. In
addition to Galena, try the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/amana-colonies/">Amana
Colonies</a> in
southeast Iowa and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/cedarburg-wisconsin/">Cedarburg</a>, just
north of Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Fallen leaves also reveal greater expanses of glowing stone in areas
that have a lot of outcroppings. In the <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-wisconsin-dells/">Wisconsin
Dells</a></strong> , tour boats take passengers past
the famous sandstone formations until the end of October. And in fall,
the popular area is very mellow.</p>
<p>In the north woods, color is iffy this week, though it's my favorite
time to go hiking: Views are better when leaves are down, the crowds are
gone and the rifle season for deer hasn't yet started.</p>
<p>Try <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">hiking along the <strong>North Shore</strong></a>, where red mountain-ash berries often provide bright dots of color. And
after the big Minnesota school break in late October, hotel and cabin
rates drop and stay low until ski season.</p>
<h3>First week of November</h3>
<p>And anywhere along <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/">Lake Michigan</a> is a
good bet — its warm waters slow the approach of winter along its
shores. Try <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/Interurban-milwaukee-bike-trails/">bicycling along the
lakeshore</a>
around <em>Milwaukee</em> , where willows turn golden two weeks later than
other trees.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_late_color.jpg" alt="Late fall in Whitewater." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In southeast Minnesota, Whitewater State Park retains color nearly to
Halloween.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Near the Illinois border, trees on the shores of <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/walking-lake-geneva/"><strong>Lake
Geneva</strong></a>
stay yellow into November.</p>
<p>In
