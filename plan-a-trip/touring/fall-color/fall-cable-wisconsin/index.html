<h2>Fall frames the abundant beauty around a northwest Wisconsin town.</h2>

Along County Road D between Grand View and Cable, trees stay golden into
the third weekend of October.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the forests and lakes around the northwestern Wisconsin town of
Cable, the reds, oranges and yellows of fall are mere gilding on the
lily.</p>
<p>This landscape, much of it part of Chequamegon National Forest, is
beautiful in any season.</p>
<p>In winter, cross-country skiers glide along forest paths and the
52-kilometer Birkebeiner trail, on which North America's largest and
most famous nordic-skiing race is held each February.</p>
<p>In spring, the mountain-biking season starts, culminating in September
with the Chequamegon Fat Tire Festival, the nation's largest.</p>
<p>But fall is for lingerers. It's hard to move fast when there are so
many glowing colors to gape at.</p>
<p>Before loggers came in the 1880s, there was only a sea of green needles.
But the vast tracts of white pine vanished into the sawmills; hardwoods
replaced them, and lake resorts replaced the logging camps.</p>
<p>I drove and hiked my way around Cable one fall, as leaves were starting
to pop into their fall palette. Following a route mapped out by the
chamber of commerce, I set out along County Road M, passing a canoe
landing into the Namekagon River, part of the St. Croix National Scenic
Riverway.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Along Garmisch Road, the route passed the two-mile Forest Lodge Nature
Trail, which turned out to be a marvel, from a dark hemlock grove worthy
of Hansel and Gretel to a magical little bog circled by spruce and
covered with cotton grass, their tufted white heads waving on slender
stems.</p>
<p>Everywhere I walked, consulting the excellent trail booklet left in a
box by the Cable Natural History Museum, I flushed chipmunks, who ran
squealing across the path and up trees.</p>
<p>Another mile along the road, I came to the gates of Garmisch USA.</p>
<p>This gloriously atmospheric resort was built by Chicago businessman
Jacob Loeb in 1927, three years after he saved his teen-age nephew,
Richard Loeb, from the electric chair. Loeb and friend Nathan Leopold
had been convicted in a sensational trial of murdering a young boy for
the thrill of it.</p>
<p>The lodge was sold in 1955 to a wealthy young skier named Jean Funk, who
gave it the look of a medieval hunting lodge, with iron chandeliers,
suits of armor and stuffed animals snarling from corners.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/cable_garmisch_castle.jpg" alt="The Blarney Castle at Garmisch Resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Its rooms have been updated without compromising the Never-Neverland
feel. I dropped my bag in Room 7, which has a stone fireplace and a
fabulous view of Lake Namekagon, and continued on my route.</p>
<p>Turning up Forest Road 192, I stopped at Atkins Lake, a perfectly clear
little orb with picnic tables alongside a sandy beach.</p>
<p>A little farther along, I crossed the North Country National Scenic
Trail, which someday will stretch 3,200 miles from North Dakota to New
York; 60 miles now run through Chequamegon National Forest.</p>
<p>I got out to walk, the map having promised a &quot;delightful vista,&quot; and
after a 15-minute stroll through quiet forest reached a craggy bald
hilltop with not just a vista, but a panoramic view of the surrounding
forest.</p>
<p>The route wound north along gravel roads to Grand View, a milltown until
the last mill closed in 1912.</p>
<p>There's a wood statue of Chief Namekagon in a little park two blocks
north of Wisconsin 63, with a plaque telling a story no doubt meant to
be titillating, but actually sad.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The chief, ostracized by his tribe, lived on an island in the big lake
and regularly walked the 25 miles to Ashland to buy goods, especially
whiskey, always paying with pure silver ore.</p>
<p>In old age, he tried to show a white friend his mine, but before he
could, he made one last whiskey run and was found frozen on the trail
home. Therefore, reads the plaque, &quot;Someday, someone will find Chief
Namekagon's silver mine. It may be you. Who knows?&quot;</p>
<p>Today, businesses in Grand View sell cheese curds, antiques and, yes,
whiskey.</p>
<p>The route then heads south on County Road D, passing the eastern border
of Porcupine Lake Wilderness Area; to reach a ½-mile trail to Porcupine
Lake, travel four miles west on Forest Road 213. The North Country
National Scenic Trail winds through the wilderness area just north of
the lake.</p>
<p>In Cable, I stopped by the handsome little Cable Natural History Museum
and followed a phenology from April 29 (&quot;The ice went out on the lake
last night, and in the morning the loons arrived&quot;) to Oct. 11 (&quot;The
tamaracks are gold now&quot;).</p>
<p>Back at Garmisch, I spent a quiet night with my wood fire and view and
thought how lucky I was to be there. My sentiments were echoed the next
morning by another guest who says she makes a hobby of looking for
atmospheric old lodges.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, this place is incredible,&quot; said Gloria Roder of nearby
Bayfield, who says she's been coming to Garmisch since she heard about
it from a customer in her antique shop. &quot;There's nothing else like
this, truly.&quot;</p>
