<h2>In fall, this lake-resort area is a hideaway in plain sight.</h2>

<p>It was a warm, sunny fall day in the heart of Minnesota. The woods were
aglow with color, and there were many ways to wallow in it — on trails
for hiking, paved paths for biking, lakes for boating.</p>
<p>But something was missing. Where were all the people?</p>
<p>Apparently, they were on the North Shore, fighting for space amid crowds
that arrive as reliably as spawning salmon.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, we tend to get into ruts. We go to the lake in summer, but
in fall, we head mainly to the North Shore and the Mississippi and St.
Croix river valleys.</p>
<p>Those places are very nice, of course. But so are those most packed in
summer — the Brainerd lakes, for example.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In fall, there's a hint of melancholy in lakes country; the faint echos
of children's laughter and water-ski boats seem to hang in the air. But
autumn colors are vibrant in the hardwood forests, and there's lots to
do when the air is crisp.</p>
<p>Best of all, there are no crowds, and it's not hard to find a place to
stay, even at the last minute.</p>
<p>One year, I spent the first weekend of October in the Brainerd lakes
area, which is misleadingly named because few tourists spend time in
Brainerd. Golfers and shoppers go to Nisswa, home of the largest
resorts.</p>
<p>The best hiking and horseback-riding trails are in state forests —
Foot Hills, Pillsbury, Crow Wing.</p>
<p>Bicyclists have the Paul Bunyan State Trail from Baxter and the Cuyuna
Lakes State Trail from Crosby.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/r/crosby_cuyuna_lakes.jpg" alt="Near Crosby, the Pennington overlook has a view of mine-pit" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Area has a view of mine-pit lakes.

<p>The 50 miles of
mountain-biking trails in the Cuyuna Country State Recreation Area have
turned Crosby into a mountain-biking destination.</p>
<p>Between 1907 and 1977, the Cuyuna Range yielded millions of tons of
manganese ore. But aside from a few signs — an old ore cart in a yard,
towns named Iron Hub and Ironton —  it's hard to tell this was a
mining community.</p>
<p>Today, the open pits are shimmering lakes, with 26 miles of thickly
wooded shorelines that, unlike the busy lakes to the west, are
undeveloped. Some people even compare parts of the area to the Boundary
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.</p>
<p>Paddlers are discovering the pit lakes, but scuba divers have been
frequenting them for decades because the water is so clear.</p>
<p>From Crosby, my friends Judy and Marie and I  rode the paved, eight-mile Cuyuna Lakes
State Trail, which eventually will extend west to the Paul Bunyan State
Trail and east to Aitkin.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's short but beautiful, winding through a canopy of trees to the
shorelines of some of the biggest pit lakes.</p>
<p>Then we headed north, crossing the Mississippi River and skirting Crow
Wing State Forest on our way to a stay in Manhattan Beach, an old resort
area on the Whitefish Chain.</p>
<p>In the morning, we drove along the Paul Bunyan Scenic Byway to Pine
River. From there, we drove four miles west to Pine River Riding Stable,
a 240-acre ranch on the Pine River.</p>
<p>The sunny fall day called for a trail ride, but Marie was a little
worried about handling the big steeds.</p>
<p>Our guide, Bonnie Savey, led us into a forest path cushioned with fallen
leaves: &quot;This makes you feel like you're walking the yellow brick
road,&quot; she said. Then, to Marie's surprise, we crossed the river, and
not on a bridge.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/r/crosby_bike_tour.jpg" alt="Two bicyclists pedal on the Tour de Cuyuna in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Cuyuna.

<p>But we felt safe on our big mounts — Judy's horse, Hot Shot, a
Paint-Shire cross, was more than 18 hands high, or 6 feet.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't have any idea you can fall off that horse, because it's
like sitting on a table,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>By the time we got back, Marie had lost her fear of horses.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks for forcing me,&quot; she said. Then we spent half an hour at the
ranch's petting zoo, which had billy goats, donkeys, geese, potbellied
pigs, sheep and emus.</p>
<p>Since we already were almost halfway to the Cut Lake Trail in Foot Hills
State Forest, we drove another six miles west on County Road 2.</p>
<p>In fall, the trail system was even prettier than the last time I'd been
there, on skis. We took the Bull Moose loop, a wide, grassy path through
a rolling landscape of Norway pine, birch and tawny oaks.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then Marie and Judy headed home. So did I, but I stopped for one last
hike at the Northland Arboretum in Baxter, just east of the busy 371
commercial strip.</p>
<p>The arboretum has nearly 20 kilometers of trails, and on the Acorn
Trail, I absorbed a last eyeful of fall hues: the fluorescent yellow of
aspens, backlit against the blue sky; maples as red as the flocked
wallpaper of a supper club; fiddlehead ferns the color of old leather.</p>
<p>When the colors are out and the weather is fair, every minute counts.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Brainerd Lakes in fall</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  It's about 2½ hours north of the Twin Cities.</p>
<p><em>Fall-color tours:</em> The 54-mile <a href="https://paulbunyanscenicbyway.org/">Paul Bunyan Scenic
Byway</a> includes two loops around
the Whitefish Chain of lakes, east of Minnesota 371 between Pequot Lakes

<p>Pick up maps at the welcome center on Minnesota 371, eight miles south
of Brainerd. The tourism bureau also suggests two other fall-color
tours, the 38-mile Gull Lake Tour and 20-mile Round Lake Tour.</p>
