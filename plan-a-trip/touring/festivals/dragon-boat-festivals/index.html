<p>For a long time, the people of Superior, Wis., observed mostly
Scandinavian traditions.</p>
<p>And then the dragons arrived.</p>
<p>In China, the works of poet Qu Yuan inspired dragon-boat races, which
are held worldwide and have been popular in Canada for many years.</p>
<p>Superior got the idea from Thunder Bay, and it hosted its first Lake
Superior Dragon Boat Festival in 2002. It was a roaring success, and
other cities have followed suit. Now, the races are one of the
fastest-growing water sports.</p>
<p>Anyone who sees a dragon boat won't forget it.</p>
<p>Painted in bright colors, with heads that feature bulging eyes and
bright-white fangs, they are to ordinary boats what a centipede is to a
beetle — 40 feet long and 650 to 1,300 pounds, dragon boats require 20
paddlers, plus a drummer and a steersman.</p>
<p>But they fly through the water, if a team achieves the synchronicity
borne of many hours of practice. For the teams, it's serious sport, but
also a chance to socialize and have fun.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At Superior's first Lake Superior Dragon Boat Festival, the fun-loving
Canadian teams set the tone.</p>
<p>&quot;This is my first year, and I'm loving it,&quot; said Carolyn Weiss of
Thunder Bay's Women on Fire. &quot;Twenty-two women in a boat — what do you
think? Or co-ed, that's even better, and on a road trip — hello?!&quot;</p>
<p>The all-woman team from Thunder Bay arrived with a comely uniform —
long black skirts edged in flames, red and orange curling ribbon in
their hair and black T-shirts reading &quot;Canadian Girls Kick Ass&quot; — and
a chant, &quot;Women, women, women on <em>fire!</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Canadians are so much fun,&quot; says Pat Pluntz of the Superior Rotary.
&quot;People in Canada like to have a good time, and they know <em>how</em>
to have a good time.&quot;</p>
<p>Duluth's Harbor Town Rotary got the idea for a benefit dragon-boat
festival after visiting Thunder Bay, she said, but decided the Duluth
waterfront wasn't safe for a race.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/r/dragon_superior.jpg" alt="A paper dragon in Superior." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A parade starts the festival in Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>They approached the Superior Rotary, and the two clubs sent a team to
paddle in Thunder Bay's festival. There, Pluntz said, &quot;we got hooked but
good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hooked is the word I use,&quot; she said. &quot;You just can't get enough. It's
so fun, so energetic.&quot;</p>
<p>The Superior festival is held next to the 1896 whaleback U.S.S. Meteor
on Barker's Island.</p>
<p>When I was there, it started with a parade of teams, a Waking of the
Dragon ceremony, Kabuki theater, lion dancers, live music, fireworks and
plenty of conviviality around the beer tent.</p>
<p>But races started at 7 sharp the next morning, with heats of four boats
starting every 15 minutes, each frantically paddling a 400-meter course
past Superior's 1889 Fairlawn Mansion.</p>
<p>On the sidelines, teams waited for their races, many making sartorial
statements: the Iron Oresmen from Virginia, Minn., wore yellow hard
hats, and Smoke on the Water sported Canadian-flag bandanas, Molson
boxer shorts and red shirts with maple leaves on the sleeves.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Women on Fire were there, raising their arms and chanting, &quot;Women women
women go women!&quot;</p>
<p>And there seemed to be many women named &quot;Vanessa&quot; in embroidered
chartreuse T-shirts. Before I knew it, I was a Vanessa myself, drafted
to paddle in the second race for the Rowtary Babes of the Twin
Cities-western Wisconsin-southern Minnesota Rotary districts.</p>
<p>They weren't expecting to make much of a splash, but they were having a
great time racing.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been in hysterics,&quot; said Terry Gilberstadt of St. Paul. &quot;We had
to practice with broomsticks and chairs.&quot;</p>
<p>After a few stretching exercises and a quick lesson — lean forward,
try to synchronize with the people in front and diagonal to me and
thrust my paddle deep into the water, right up my hand — we were in
the boat and ready to go.</p>
<p>We had a steerswoman from Ashland who'd been recruited by the Duluth
Boat Club and, she said, had trained the previous weekend.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/r/arlington_dragon_boats.jpg" alt="Dragon boats vie for the win." /><p class="copyright">&copy; GWN Dragon Boat</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Boats start a race at Arlington Heights.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The starting gun cracked, our drum began to beat, we dug our paddles
into the water in rhythm — and had nearly propelled ourselves into the
next lane when the steerswoman shouted, &quot;Hold the boat!&quot;</p>
<p>We stopped, started, again veered hard to the right and heard, &quot;Hold the
boat!&quot; We sat there looking at the other three boats, already in, and
meekly limped back after the announcer told us to finish the race.</p>
<p>At the end of the day we'd placed dead last of 70 teams, but who cares?</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't done anything this fun for a long time,&quot; said teammate
Jackie Kearns of St. Paul.</p>
<p>At the awards ceremony, I talked with Donna Stuart of Thunder Bay's
Dragons of Hope, who had placed first in the Breast-Cancer Survivors
Challenge Class and second in the All-Women Challenge Class.</p>
<p>Across Canada, she said, there are 33 teams like hers, inspired by a
Toronto study that showed the many benefits of dragon-boat racing on
breast-cancer survivors.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;We're racing against each other, but also we're racing trying to
survive,&quot; she said, beaming. &quot;You're all in the same boat, you all have
to be together — as you can see, it's awesome.&quot;</p>
<p>These days, Superior's festival is even larger, with more of everything,
including children's activities, food vendors and boats. Apparently,
dragon-boat racing is an idea for which the Twin Ports were more than
ready.</p>
<p>&quot;To go to a dragon-boat festival is like getting out of everyday life
and stepping into another world,&quot; Pluntz says. &quot;It's fun, it's
exciting, it's colorful and anything goes.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Dragon-boat festivals in the Upper Midwest</h3>
<p>Many of these races are held as part of larger summer festivals that
draw many people, so people who want weekend lodgings should reserve
them now.</p>
<p>Most dragon-boat races are fund-raisers, usually for hospitals and/or
breast-cancer research. Money raised by the Lake Superior Festival is
donated primarily for cancer research.</p>
<p>Anyone can form a team, which must pay a registration fee; those without
boats can rent them. Each team must have at least eight female
paddlers.</p>
