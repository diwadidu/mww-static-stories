<p>Every good parade tells a story. Pay attention, and you'll learn everything you need to know about a town.</p>
<p>Take New Ulm, Minn., a town of 14,000 at the confluence of the Minnesota and Cottonwood rivers.</p>
<p>You'll see gold-painted gymnasts in gold-lam� wigs, representing the Turners who founded New Ulm. A horse-drawn wagon rolls by from Schell, the second-oldest family-owned brewery in the nation. And here come the cannons of the New Ulm Battery, formed after the Dakota nearly wiped out the town in 1862.</p>
<p>There are accordion players in lederhosen, princesses in dirndls and garden gnomes in conical red hats. There is a miniature Glockenspiel and a statue of Hermann on the City of Festivals float. Mischievous Narren in hand-carved wood masks walk alongside it, trying not to frighten children.</p>
<p>Like New Ulm, the parade is as German as sauerkraut. Maybe more so.</p>
<p>&quot;Parades are kind of communal storytelling,&quot; says Chris Lutter-Gardella, whose giant puppets appear in parades all over the region. &quot;They become a community's way of expressing itself.&quot;</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>Trolls, fiddlers and Vikings march the streets of Decorah, Iowa. In Sault Ste. Marie, tugboats amass at the foot of the Soo Locks. On the Minnesota prairie in Luverne, you'll see stuffed bison and gigantic combines.</p>
<p>&quot;You can tell what people in town think is important based on what ends up in the parade,&quot; says Robert Lavenda, professor of anthropology at St. Cloud State University and author of &quot;Corn Fests and Water Carnivals: Celebrating Community in Minnesota&quot; (Smithsonian, 1997).</p>
<p>&quot;For some towns, it's the biggest, most powerful farm equipment the town can deploy, and for some towns, that isn't important at all,&quot; he says. &quot;Once, I had an organizer whisper to me, 'I finally got the last of the damn farm implements out of the parade.'&quot;</p>
<h3>A big hubbub</h3>
<p>For me, every parade is a good parade. All you do is sit, gawk and rake in the Tootsie Rolls � but afterward, you feel you've had a part in something meaningful.</p>
<p>Of course, some parades have more character than others. One of my favorites is the Fourth of July parade on Madeline Island.</p>
<p>When I saw it, Lutter-Gardella was dressed as Uncle Sam, walking next to a giant, rainbow-colored tortoise puppet and swinging a giant timepiece while yelling, &quot;Slow down, America! You're on island time.&quot;</p>
<p>For years, he has hosted workshops in the island's Art Park, where anyone can drop by and make a mask or puppet for the parade. Now, he lives in Minneapolis and does the same for the annual May Day Parade in Powderhorn Park and for such communities as Reedsburg, Wis., which hired him to &quot;make a parade&quot;' � and with it, a public statement.</p>
<p>&quot;They're saying, 'We're fun people, come play with us,'&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Big Top Chautauqua impresario and songwriter Warren Nelson has been part of the Madeline Island parade since his Lost Nation String Band and its big green bus got shanghaied into it more than 15 years ago.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd played a gig at the Beach Club the night before and were on our way to the ferry, but we couldn't get through because of the crowd,&quot; he says. &quot;Then someone said, 'You guys are in the parade,' so we drove our green bus and threw albums out the window.&quot;</p>
<p>Nelson got a taste for pageantry watching the old King Korn Day parade in his native Fairmont, Minn.</p>
<p>&quot;I like parades for the same reason I like county fairs and state fairs; it's just a big hubbub,&quot; he says. &quot;My father was a milker salesman, and he'd drag me around to all the county fairs. We'd have to be there early to set up at 6 a.m., and then I'd have the run of the fairgrounds for 10 or 12 hours.&quot;</p>
<p>Watching parades lets spectators read a town like a book. Over Memorial Day in Chicago, I watched platoons of parading Hispanic reservists, followed by Korean dancers waving banners. Message? This city is a mosaic, proud of heritage as well as country.</p>
<p>It was the same in little Westby, Wis., where the Syttende Mai parade includes a lot of royalty in Norwegian costume, local Civil War re-enactors, a pair of elflike Nisse and several big, ugly trolls. It's telling that this little village even celebrates Syttende Mai, the day in 1814 when Norway, for centuries subservient to Denmark, signed a democratic constitution.</p>
<p>Stoughton, near Madison, puts on such a big Syttende Mai celebration it's said to be the largest in the world, including Norway, where people don't need to work so hard at being Norwegian.</p>
<p>It has two parades, with lots of flaxen-haired girls in embroidered red bonnets and burly Vikings in horned helmets and animal hides, chanting like overgrown Munchkins.</p>
<p>ADS:16</p>
<h3>Time warps</h3>
<p>Sometimes, however, I'm not exactly sure what a parade reveals about a town. During Chippewa Falls' Pure Water Days parade in August, a Bible-camp float featured a recruiting poster for the military: &quot;The U.S. Army Wants You.&quot;</p>
<p>And watching Winona's Steamboat Days parade in June, I marveled at Shriners wearing Chinese coolie hats and &quot;Injun&quot;-style painted faces and feathered headdresses. Their willful cluelessness was breathtaking, especially in a town that had just hosted the annual Great Dakota Gathering Homecoming, was built on the site of a Dakota village and is named for a Dakota woman.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, nobody would have blinked. But today? What's up with that?</p>
<p>&quot;I've asked that of myself more than once,&quot; Lavenda says. &quot;It's a curious thing. But one of the things festivals do is efface time � you never know what time it is, because festivals have looked like this for a long time.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, parades remind people of the days before life got so complicated, and they like that.</p>
<p>Yet the crowd favorite at Steamboat Days parade was the South Shore Drill Team, composed entirely of black youths from Chicago who wore all-white gowns and suitcoats and waved white flags as they marched and danced with dazzling precision.</p>
<p>So time does march on. The drill team will return, says Steamboat Days secretary Pam Simon, thanks to financial support from local businesses.</p>
<p>Winona's parade is one of the region's most impressive, in large part because of the many marching bands � there are never fewer than eight, Simon says, and usually 12 to 15. Politicians are few and far between; the mayor is always there, but others come by invitation only, and then only in non-election years. And the parade is long but well-organized, without the dreaded &quot;gaps&quot; that keep spectators waiting.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't just send in semis with a name plastered on them,&quot; Simon says. &quot;When you come to this parade, expect to be entertained.&quot;</p>
<h3>The public face</h3>
<p>For tourists, a parade is the public face of a town. New Ulm started its Heritagefest and parade because industry had brought in a more diverse population, says Bob Beussman, but the town still was perceived as closed to newcomers and visitors.</p>
<p>After 31 years, Heritagefest was replaced by the Bavarian Blast festival, but the parade goes on.</p>
<p>&quot;We needed something to single us out from other cities,&quot; said Beussman, director of the Concord Singers, a German-language male chorus. &quot;We realized back then that we couldn't be a closed ship, or we'd be sinking.&quot;</p>
<p>And the July parade is only one of many: There are also parades for Memorial Day, River Blast, homecoming, German Heritage Day, Christmas, Ag Day and St. Patrick's Day.</p>
<p>Beussman can be found on the City of Festivals float, wearing lederhosen, dancing with the princesses and doing the &quot;New Ulm wave, which is as wild as you can get when you wave.&quot;</p>
<p>The message? Welcome to New Ulm, especially if you're a tourist.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a shirt at Schell's that's my favorite,&quot; Beussman says. &quot;It says, 'New Ulm, a friendly little drinking town with a tourist problem.' And we love every one of them.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Top parades</h3>
<p>When the weather is fine, every parade is a top parade. Below are just a few of those being held in this region.</p>
<p>For some of the many other festivals with parades, see <a href="/plan%5Fa%5Ftrip/touring/festivals/midwest%5Fsummer%5Ffestivals.html">Great summer festivals</a>; <a href="/plan%5Fa%5Ftrip/best%5Ftrips/day%5Ftrips/midwest%5Ffall%5Ffestivals.html">Great fall festivals</a>; <a href="/plan%5Fa%5Ftrip/history%5Fheritage/heritage%5Ftravel/midwest%5Fethnic%5Ffestivals.html">Celebrating roots</a>; and <a href="/plan%5Fa%5Ftrip/touring/festivals/food%5Ffestivals%5Fmidwest.html">A feast of festivals</a>.</p>
<p>If you're a kid, here's a rule of thumb: Parades in small towns will net you the most candy (bring a bag for all of your loot). Norwegian towns seem to give out the most.</p>
