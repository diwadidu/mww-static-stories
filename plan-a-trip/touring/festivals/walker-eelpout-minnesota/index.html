<h2>In February, a Minnesota fishing town lets loose at a goofy festival.</h2>

<p>On lazy summer days, Walker is a classic northwoods Minnesota town.</p>
<p>I've been going to a lake resort near there with my family for years.
We ride our bikes into town on the Heartland State Trail, eat ice cream
at the Village Square and buy muskmelons and corn on the cob from the
stand near the gas station.</p>
<p>The pace is slow, serene — unless a Crazy Day Sale falls on a cloudy
day, in which case the resorts empty and shoppers crowd into the town of
1,100 like sheep to salt.</p>
<p>I thought I knew Walker. But when I turned up there during the winter, I
found a different town. Walker had gone wild.</p>
<p>At the center of this turnabout is the eelpout, a roughfish that pops
out of the depths mostly in winter, when it spawns. It's famous for its
revolting looks and behavior to match: When a fisherman pulls one out of
a hole in the ice, the pout is likely to wrap its mottled, eel-like tail
around his arm.</p>
<p>Often, the pout announces its slimy self even before that.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;The thing is, half the time they crawl up backward,&quot; said founder
Ken Bresley. &quot;You've had a few drinks, and you've never seen that
before. It causes you to take a lot more drinks.&quot;</p>
<p>Bresley is the one who first hit on something important: Eelpout were
created to be the butt of jokes. Jokes flow best on a tide of beer. Beer
is what you drink when you're ice-fishing, and ice-fishing is what
Walker's economy needed more of in the winter.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of a beautiful relationship.</p>
<p>Today, the International Eelpout Festival, which Bresley started in
1979, brings more than 10,000 people to Walker every year for a rousing
good time.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Walker on a sunny, warm Eelpout Saturday, I was amazed
by the number of cars crawling through the streets, but that was nothing
compared to the traffic on and around Leech Lake.</p>
<p>As I walked through the grounds of Chase on the Lake, a Tudor-style
hotel, a trio of snowmobilers roared up and circled me, looking as if
they'd like to toss out a lasso.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/walker_eelpout_batter.jpg" alt="Ice baseball at Eelpout Fest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It put me on notice: The wide-open spaces of Leech Lake, Minnesota's
third-largest, turn snowmobilers into ice cowboys, and unwary
pedestrians into little dogies on a cattle drive.</p>
<p>I thought everyone not moving at 40 mph would be fishing, but that
wasn't exactly true. Out on the ice, around an encampment dubbed
Jurassic Pout, two women with deep tans were sitting on a sofa, playing
cribbage.</p>
<p>A string of pout lay abandoned on the ice, apparently the limit of the
team's aspirations, and a man walked up with careful steps and urged me
to take one home. A steadier Jurassic Pouter named Sherrie followed him.
&quot;We're just drinking today,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Nearby, members of Club Oasis danced under plastic palm trees to an
overamplified reggae tune with the refrain &quot;We're Going on a Beer
Run.&quot;</p>
<p>Across a snowbank studded with pink flamingos, a pitcher was tossing
iceballs, each of which coated the batter in a hail of slivers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I looked inside the tent of Team Iowa, thinking I might find some fish
being caught, but Team Iowa was sitting placidly around some Diet Cokes
and Cheez Balls.</p>
<p>&quot;We hit it pretty hard yesterday,&quot; explained Steve Kannegieter, who
had driven up with his buddies from the northwest Iowa town of Sibley.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been here two years now, and we haven't caught an eelpout
yet,&quot; he said. &quot;We can't keep those pesky walleye off our hook.&quot;
He demonstrated an orange-and-white gadget called a Polar Tip-Up placed
over the ice hole.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, I've never caught anything with it,&quot; he added with a
shrug. &quot;We just like to drink and talk smart.&quot;</p>
<p>At the weigh-in station, I eyeballed an eelpout up close. The winner, an
apparently gluttonous pout of nearly 13 pounds, was lying under the
weighing table, its squashed face and bulging white belly turned toward
me.</p>
<p>&quot;That's a pig, not an eelpout,&quot; sneered the woman handing out
souvenir copies of the Pout-Independent, a local newspaper known as the
Pilot-Independent on other days.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/walker_eelpout.jpg" alt="A fish house on Leech Lake during Eelpout Fest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A man in a white chef's toque bustled up and snatched a 7½-pound pout
on the scale, the previous occupant of the display tub in the food tent
having passed away. I followed him and joined the long line waiting for
a plate of fries and hot nuggets of fresh pout, which were
<a href="http://heavytable.com/the-redemption-of-the-eelpout/">delicious</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, no one badmouths the taste of the ugly pout, which is
the only freshwater member of the cod family.</p>
<p>Then Ken Bresley walked by and urged me to go see the two-story ice
house at the far end of the lake, which had, he said, an aquarium and a
sauna. I wondered at the wisdom of the latter.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Eelpout Festival, it's not supposed to make sense,&quot; he
said, then threw out his arms. &quot;Look around you.&quot;</p>
<p>With that in mind, I got into my big, heavy car and drove onto the lake,
the slush making slurping noises around my tires. I felt ridiculous
using my turn signal in the middle of a lake, but I hadn't been in
traffic that heavy since the State Fair.</p>
<p>The Pout Palace did have a sauna, standing in a half-foot of water, and
it had a pout pen sunk into the ice under the snack table. There was a
working fireplace built into one wall, and in another, two beer taps.</p>
<p>Lots of ice holes had been drilled through the carpet, but no one was
fishing. There wasn't enough room; people were packed together like
strings of freshly caught pout, and filling themselves to the gills.</p>
<p>I'll see Walker differently when I visit next. For now I know that
under that staid facade beats a very merry heart.</p>
