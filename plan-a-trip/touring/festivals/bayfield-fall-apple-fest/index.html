<h2>In Bayfield, a fall festival has grown to jumbo proportions.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/p/applefest.jpg" alt="Apple Festival in Bayfield." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
There are a lot of photo opps at Apple Fest.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Bayfield, Wis., the apple has mushroomed.</p>
<p>In 1961, the apple was the object of a small village festival. Today, it
draws 60,000 people to a fall blowout featuring all things apple —
fritters, sundaes, dumplings, pies and apple-cheeked children.</p>
<p>On northern Wisconsin's Bayfield Peninsula, Apple Festival is nearly as
revered as motherhood.</p>
<p>&quot;People really like it,&quot; says Therene Gazdik of Big Top Chautauqua.
&quot;It's a celebration, because this is it. They know that after this,
the people are gone till May.&quot;</p>
<p>Like a bear putting on fat for winter, Bayfield pulls in as many
tourists as it can before the cold winds blow on Lake Superior. It
doesn't have to try that hard; this picturesque old fishing village,
tumbling down a hillside toward a lakeshore lined by sailboats, is
irresistible to weekenders.</p>
<p>In its early days, people came just for the refreshing breezes,
especially if they suffered from hay fever.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Now, folks are a little busier. Kayakers and sailors glide over to the
Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Sightseers take cruises to see the
eight lighthouses and hear tales about shipwrecks. Vacationers take the
ferry to Madeline Island and its beaches.</p>
<p>In fall, some of the action switches to the hills above Bayfield, where
a dozen orchards produce pears, apples, pumpkins, honey, cider and
jams.</p>
<p>But mostly, people like to stroll around town, browsing in the shops on
Rittenhouse Avenue, watching boats going in and out of the marina,
walking along the Brownstone Trail or into a ravine on the Iron Bridge
Nature Trail.</p>
<p>Strolling isn't quite possible during the annual Apple Festival;
milling is what people do then, amid the crowds that descend on the
village of 800. Over the years, the festival has grown bigger and
bigger, as its fame has spread.</p>
<p>But somehow, it still manages to be not only a small-town festival but
also a festival true to Bayfield, an unpretentious place whose motto is
&quot;Real Tourists Eat Whitefish Livers.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/bayfield_adam_eve.jpg" alt="Apple Fest parade in Bayfield." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
During the parade, Eve munches on an apple with Adam on the Hauser
orchard float.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I had to see it for myself, and one of my first stops was the Grandstand
Stage, where Warren Nelson was warbling &quot;Trolling Home to You,&quot; an ode
to fishermen.</p>
<p>&quot;They go out to check their nets in the cold and dark and thank God
they do, because that's why we have fresh fish in Bayfield morning and
afternoon,&quot; sang Nelson, who founded Big Top Chautauqua on the edge of
town and co-wrote many of the historical musicals it features in summer.</p>
<p>Then, he and the Blue Canvas Orchestra &amp; Singers paused to let the
apple-peeling contest get under way. For an hour, entrants hunch over an
apple, trying to unfurl the longest possible strip of skin, using any
instrument they choose.</p>
<p>Mary Rehwald of nearby Ashland had brought a peeler, the obvious but
worst choice, as she found out when its sharp edge severed her peel
after 86 inches.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, I know,&quot; she said, popping the apple into her mouth.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Ran Wei of Beijing, a graduate student in math at the University of
Minnesota-Duluth, managed 65 inches, better than her friend Wenji's 39
inches but still a disappointment to her.</p>
<p>&quot;In my family, I think I am very good at peeling, but here I am
nothing,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>It took an orthopedic surgeon with a Swiss Army knife to leave them all
in the dust. He carved through the skin first and then used his knife's
screwdriver to separate it from the flesh.</p>
<p>As the hour drew to a close, Bob Shepley of Northfield, Minn., speeded
up, and Nelson started to heckle him.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of these peels are taking longer than it takes to pass a
Minnesota state budget,&quot; he said. &quot;You know why they call them the
Golden Gophers? Because they get roasted every Saturday.&quot;</p>
<p>The friendly gibes failed to keep the legendary Dr. Bob from his eighth
straight championship, which he won with a peel just 2 inches short of
his record: 428 inches.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/bayfield_apple_peeling.jpg" alt="Apple peeling at Bayfield's Apple Fest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
To win the peeling contest, competitors need to use surgical precision.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Shepley had to attend his son's confirmation ceremony the following
year and couldn't compete, so he divulged his secret.</p>
<p>&quot;My trick is, you have to do it upside down,&quot; he said. &quot;If you do it
from the top, the peel folds over and just snaps. It took me eight years
to figure that out.&quot;</p>
<p>A woman from the chamber of commerce took his photo, and Shepley thanked
her: &quot;I really appreciate it that you have this contest, so I can show
a talent,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>By midafternoon, throngs filled the streets of Bayfield, standing in
line for grilled apple bratwurst, looking at artwork under white tents and
watching demonstrations by the fast-talking salesman of Waterless
Kitchen Craft.</p>
<p>Up the hill at Hauser's Superior View Farms, children rode ponies in a
circle, teenagers bumbled through a fence maze, and people on a hay
wagon shouted, &quot;Yee-haw!&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/bayfield_apple_giveaway.jpg" alt="Apple Fest parade in Bayfield." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>In October, Hauser family members from around the nation return to the
1908 family farm to help during Apple Fest.</p>
<p>In a tent adjoining the family's 1920s red mail-order barn from Sears
Roebuck, Scott Hauser led a crowd through tastings of wine made from
apples and pears and flavored by currants, blackberries, cherries and
blueberries.</p>
<p>&quot;No grapes died to give you this wine, but I think you'll find it very
pleasing,&quot; he said, holding up a bottle of Queen's Red, an apple wine
named for his wife, Renate, the &quot;queen of cider.&quot;</p>
<p>Inside the barn, a poster explained why the Bayfield Peninsula is famous
for its fruit: &quot;It's the sun rising over the Great Lakes, it's the
soil left by the mighty glacier, it's the pristine water from an
ancient inland sea, it's our warm summer days and crisp autumn
nights.&quot;</p>
<p>As evening fell, the Pipes &amp; Drums of Thunder Bay, Ontario, began to
play at the base of Rittenhouse Avenue, resplendent in kilts, white
boots and black fur hats.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The musicians are an Apple Festival favorite; when they marched away,
the admiring crowd followed as closely as if they were the pied pipers
of Hamelin, not Thunder Bay.</p>
<p>Then, the Venetian Boat Parade started in the marina, with each boat
taking a turn sashaying before judges.</p>
<p>One sloop featured Bucky Badger, the University of Wisconsin mascot,
amid strings of white and gold lights; on another, a twinkling crescent
moon mimicked the real moon just above.</p>
<p>By 10:30 Sunday morning, people already were staking out spots along the
parade route, and by the time the Bayfield High School band began
marching down Rittenhouse Avenue, the town was filled to the gills.</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard rolled by in a search and rescue boat, the Hayward
Musky Festival queens waved from a float, and the staff of Maggie's
Restaurant rode a rhinestone-encrusted car with tinsel fringe and a
bubble machine.</p>

The Pipes & Drums of Thunder Bay always are a hit.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There were plenty of Tootsie Rolls tossed, but also shiny apples handed
out from baskets.</p>
<p>During Apple Festival, the crowds almost overwhelm the town. But in
beloved little Bayfield, the tourists deserve one last party.</p>
<h3>Trip tips: Apple Fest in Bayfield, Wisconsin</h3>
<p><em>When to go:</em> Crowds drop off fast after Labor Day, making September a
peaceful time to visit. After Apple Festival, the town is quiet, and
some shops reduce their hours.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.bayfield.org/bayfield-apple-festival/">Apple
Festival</a>.</strong>
It's Oct. 6-8 in 2023.</p>
<p>Bring folding chairs to sit on while listening to concerts or watching
the Sunday parade.</p>
<p><em>Hiking:</em> The Brownstone Trail follows an old rail grade 2½ miles down
the bay to Port Superior. The trailhead is the lumberyard off Manypenny
Avenue, diagonally from Maggie's Restaurant.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/bayfield_applefest_food.jpg" alt="Food stands at Apple Fest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Stands offer all kinds of food besides apples.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The half-mile Iron Bridge Nature Trail starts on Washington Avenue, near
the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore headquarters.</p>
<p><a href="https://bayfield.org/stay/"><strong>Accommodations</strong></a>: Rooms in Bayfield
book up nearly a year in advance for Apple Festival, and eventually they
book up between Duluth and the Michigan border. However, the tourism
folks often get last-minute cancellations, so check with them.</p>
<p>On other weekends, there's a nice selection of B&amp;Bs, Airbnbs, inns,
motels, condos and cottages.</p>
