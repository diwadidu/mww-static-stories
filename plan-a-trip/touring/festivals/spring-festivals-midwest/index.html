<p>In the Upper Midwest, it's hard to know when spring starts.</p>
<p>On St. Patrick's Day, revelers may parade in sun or sleet; you have to
be prepared for both. In the north woods, ski slopes hold spring luaus,
carnivals and egg hunts, and skiers had better slather on the sun block
or they'll burn.</p>
<p>March is the month for expos - antiques, autos, gardens, golf, pets
and sports - and for tastings of beer, wine and cheese. Birding
festivals start in April, and in May the flowers start popping out and
festival season starts in earnest.</p>
<p>Here are the best festivals for spring <em>2022.</em></p>
<p>Before you go, check for last-minute changes.</p>
