<p>In Traverse City, spring is when you get to do all the things you
planned in summer before you got seduced away by sand and surf.</p>
<p>I'd seen the enticing shops, theaters and tasting rooms on other visits
and planned to check them out &quot;some time.&quot;</p>
<p>Some time arrived Mother's Day weekend, when Traverse City was awash in
color. So many pear trees were flowering downtown that the streets look
frosted, and magnolia blooms were as big as popcorn balls.</p>
<p>But skies were gray, making it a perfect time to hit the craft-beer
taprooms, wineries and epicurean markets that have made the town a
foodie destination.</p>
<p>My first stop was Burritt's Market, which had put out samples of
delicacies from local orchards, farms and fisheries. Its shelves were
crowded with local wines, salsas, marinades, vinegars and jams  —
literally, Traverse City's special sauce.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Driving along Front Street, I saw all kinds of places to get
cool-weather comfort food: pasties, pie and pierogies, the humble Polish
dumpling that goes gourmet here with fillings of chives, garlic and
portobello mushrooms.</p>
<p>I kept heading west and soon was rolling up a wooded lawn to a cheerful
white castle. Built in 1885 as a state mental asylum, Grand Traverse
Commons now holds shops, galleries and, of course, good things to eat.</p>
<p>At the Pleasanton Brick Oven Bakery, once the hospital's fire house, I
asked for the addictive cranberry-pecan grissini, a chewy breadstick. At
the Underground Cheese Factory in the old soap-making building, I found
chocolate-covered cheesecake wedges on a stick — obviously, the best
way to eat cheesecake.</p>
<p>At Left Foot Charley Winery, in the old laundry, I sat at a long,
window-lined bar and sampled a lusciously fruity sauvignon blanc.
Proprietor Bryan Ulbrich explained that he blends wines from 15 local
vineyards, &quot;kind of like an all-star team.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The fruit quality here is so good it's ridiculous,&quot; he said. &quot;No
one should get fruit as good as we do.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/o/morel_traverse_city.jpg" alt="A morel near Traverse City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The area grows hops, too, and I had a hefty dose in my glass of Dead
Kettle IPA at Right Brain brewery, where locals in flannel shirts and
fishing jackets threw back pints with locavore tacos from the Roaming
Harvest food truck parked outside.</p>
<p>Many of the ingredients that feed the town's growing reputation come
from the two peninsulas that reach northward into Lake Michigan. On the
Old Mission Peninsula, I had dinner at the Peninsula Grill, enjoying
hanger steak with parsnip frites and a French-door view of daffodils,
barberry and forsythia.</p>
<p>But really, you can't go to northern Michigan in May without hunting
for morel mushrooms.</p>
<p>The morel-loving hordes were half an hour south of Traverse City at the
Mesick Mushroom Festival, but I drove half an hour east to the Grass
River Natural Area, which was offering a morel-mushroom walk —guided,
but unfortunately not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Thirty of us turned out, and I attached myself to Jim McKimmy of nearby
Elk Lake, who looked as if he knew what he was doing.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Everybody's got a theory,&quot; he said. &quot;I keep my eyes in the air for
ash.&quot;</p>
<p>The woods were filled with the fattest trilliums I'd ever seen, but the
morels were scarce. Only McKimmy found a nice-sized one, the high point
of our trek until a little boy found a red-bellied salamander.</p>
<p>&quot;That child's excitement is even better than a mushroom,&quot; McKimmy
said.</p>
<p>In nearby Bellaire, Short's Brewing was founded in 2004, making it one
of the old-timers of the Michigan craft-beer boom. In its pub, I had a
glass of the flagship Huma Lupa Licious and a pretty amazing sandwich
made of roast beef, portobello mushrooms and provolone cheese with
roasted scallion feta spread and balsamic tomato jam. Oh my!</p>
<p>It would have been easy to spend the evening hanging out in a taproom or
wine bar. Instead, I drove 15 miles south of town to the famed
Interlochen Center for the Arts to see the musical &quot;Miss Saigon.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mission_blossoms.jpg" alt="Cherry blossoms on the Old Mission Peninsula." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>It was spectacular, a high-school production in name only. Students at
the attached arts academy had come from eight countries and 27 states,
and they put on a polished show like the Broadway stars some of them no
doubt will be.</p>
<p>For Mother's Day, I celebrated with an expedition to Plamondon Shoes
and lunch at the Omelette Shop, which has been making every kind of egg
dish since 1975. My veggie skillet was good, but the fresh-squeezed
orange juice with fresh pureed strawberry was such a treat I had two.</p>
<p>And finally, the sun came out. Volleyball players and plein-air painters
materialized on the bayfront. Lines formed outside the Dairy Lodge and
Bardon's Wonder Freeze.</p>
<p>I had to see the famous cherry blossoms, so I headed up the Old Mission
Peninsula and hit the jackpot two miles out of town, with a view of blue
bay over rolling rows of fluffy white pompons.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The spring scenery was catnip for a photographer: an old barn with a
stone foundation and bright quilt. Cedar-shake gazebos alongside water
in three shades of blue. The Old Mission Point lighthouse, built in
1870.</p>
<p>Enchanted, I drove up the spine of the peninsula, whose gravelly,
water-warmed soil is perfect for growing fruit, and back along the bay,
absorbing the scenery with the sun.</p>
<p>Back in town, I had a twist cone at Bardon's to celebrate. Spring can
be a tease in Traverse City, but it always comes through.</p>
