<p>It's a beautiful spring day — finally. The trees are budding, the
birds are chirping. What do you do?</p>
<p>Road trip! Somehow, the call of the highway is especially strong in
spring. We want to feel the wind on our face and see something new and
unusual.</p>
<p>There's a lot to do along the way: Walk through bluebells, spot birds,
visit artist studios, sample cheese, watch a parade.</p>
<p>Here are 20 of the best spring drives in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa,
Illinois and Michigan.</p>
<p>And for even more, check out our <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadtrips/">Road Trips</a>.</p>
<h3>WISCONSIN</h3>
<p>Wisconsin has one national scenic byway, the <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/city/great-river-road-national-scenic-byway">Great River
Road</a>
along the Mississippi, and three state byways: the <a href="http://scenicbyways.info/byway/80920.html">Lower Wisconsin
River Road</a> between Lodi and
Prairie du Chien; the <a href="http://doorcountycoastalbyway.org/">Door County Coastal
Byway</a> ; and the <a href="http://www.lakesuperiorbyway.org/">Wisconsin Lake
Superior Scenic Byway</a> around the
Bayfield Peninsula.</p>
<p>It also has two national-forest scenic byway, the Great Divide Highway
between Hayward and Glidden in Chequamegon National Forest; and the
Heritage Drive in Nicolet National Forest east of Eagle River and Three
Lakes.</p>

<h3>Exploring <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/rustic-roads/">Rustic Roads</a></h3>
<p>Whenever I'm in Wisconsin, I check out whatever Rustic Road is nearby.
They're scenic, lightly traveled roads, many of which preserve remnants
of the past — lighthouses, one-room schoolhouses, country churches.</p>
<p>My favorites in spring are the wildflower-lined <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/tours/rustic-road-51-199098">Rustic Road
51</a> near
Maiden Rock and <a href="http://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr21.aspx">Rustic Road
21</a>,
which leads to the sandstone arch of Natural Bridge State Park near
Baraboo. But they all give you a good excuse to go exploring.</p>
<p>Maps and descriptions of the 117 <a href="http://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/maps.aspx">Rustic
Roads</a>
are online.</p>
<h3>A slice of <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/cheese-country/">cheese country</a></h3>
<p>In southwest Wisconsin, three towns have maintained the Old World
traditions brought by the first settlers.</p>
<p>This is a drive where you want to bring an appetite. Start in the Swiss
village of <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-glarus-wisconsin/">New
Glarus</a>,
half an hour southwest of Madison (beer, pastries, sausages, chocolate,
cheese).</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/v/e/vernon_county_evanstad_barn.jpg" alt="The round Evanstad barn in Vernon County." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Evanstad barn near Dell is one of Vernon County's last round barns.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Head west on Wisconsin 39, stopping just west of Hollandale to see the
wonderful Grandview folk-art sculptures.</p>
<p>For more around the state, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/Wisconsin-folk-art/">Road trip: Wisconsin's concrete
art</a>.</p>
<p>Continue to the Cornish village of <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/mineral-point-art-tour/">Mineral
Point</a>
(pasties, figgyhobbin, saffron cake, cheese).</p>
<p>Take Wisconsin 23 south to Darlington, then Wisconsin 81 east to the
Swiss town of <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/cheese-country-wisconsin/">Monroe</a>
(cheese, beer, fruit). It's a totally delectable tour.</p>
<h3>Around <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/birds-horicon-marsh-wisconsin/">Horicon Marsh</a></h3>
<p>In spring, the avian freeway to the north runs right over this
Everglades of the North, southwest of Fond du Lac. On the ground, humans
take the 50-mile <a href="https://www.fws.gov/uploadedFiles/Horicon%20Marsh%20Bicycle%20and%20Auto%20Tour%20Map.pdf">Auto
Tour</a>
around the marsh.</p>
<p>It passes state and federal visitors centers, hiking trails and
overlooks with spotting scopes. Rustic Road 106 is off the northeast
part of the marsh, and on the west side, the route parallels the Wild
Goose State Trail.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In May, you'll catch the <a href="https://horiconmarshbirdclub.com/bird-festival/">Horicon Marsh Bird
Festival</a>, which
includes tours, hikes and bird-banding demonstrations that are very
beginner-friendly.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/wisconsin-muir-tour/">Nature along the Wisconsin River</a></h3>
<p>In a mere half-hour of driving, you can see some of the environmental
world's most historic landmarks - and spring is the best time to do
it.</p>
<p>John Muir's family farm now is a county park north of Portage. From
there, cross the river to Levee Road, much of it Rustic Road 49.</p>
<p>Drive west to the Aldo Leopold Center and the naturalist's famous
shack, the only chicken coop on the National Register.</p>
<p>Then drive down Shady Lane to the International Crane Foundation and
take a guided tour of the enclosures where at least one of all 15 of the
world's cranes live. Wander along the trails, which are lined with
wildflowers in spring.</p>
<p>And for a bonus, head past Baraboo and south to <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=1">Parfrey's
Glen</a>, a
spectacular little gorge that was Wisconsin's very first natural area.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_grove_viking_park.jpg" alt="The Viking in Spring Grove's park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Viking Memorial Park is in full bloom during Syttende Mai in Spring
Grove.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/spring-scenery/kickapoo-valley-wisconsin/">The Kickapoo Valley</a></h3>
<p>In the coulee country southeast of La Crosse, unyielding rock dictates
the famously crooked course of the Kickapoo River</p>
<p>This is the Driftless Area, and mile for mile, it's the most
picturesque in Wisconsin. Here's a loop that takes in many of the
highlights.</p>
<p>From Ontario, follow the Kickapoo south on Wisconsin 131, past <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/wildcat/">Wildcat
Mountain State Park</a>.</p>
<p>Turn west on rolling County Road P, which will take you through Dell and
past the blue Evanstad round barn, which in spring is framed by
flowering trees. Head north on County Road D to <a href="http://www.oldcountrycheese.com/">Old Country
Cheese</a> ; stop and buy some curds.</p>
<p>Keep going driving north; you'll come out onto Wisconsin 33 near
Cashton. Take it east back to Ontario, stopping to shop at the many
Amish farms on the way (unless it's Sunday).</p>
<p>You also can continue south on Wisconsin 131 to the Kickapoo Valley
Reserve, a green zone for fishing, hiking, canoeing, bicycling and bird
watching.</p>
<p>Keep going past apple orchards and you'll come to Gays Mills, which
holds its <a href="http://www.gaysmills.org/springfestival.html">Spring Festiva</a>
<a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/events/fairs-festivals/gays-mills-spring-festival-42608">l</a>
in May.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/u/tunnel_trees_spring.jpg" alt="Tunnel of Trees in spring." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Michigan's Tunnel of Trees is lined with trilliums in May.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>WISCONSIN/MINNESOTA</h3>
<p>Continue through the Driftless Area and across the Mississippi River.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/norwegians-minnesota-wisconsin-iowa/">Two Norwegian villages</a></h3>
<p>May is the biggest month on the Norwegian-American calendar, and May 17
the biggest day. That's Syttende Mai, the day in 1814 when Norway
declared independence from Denmark and adopted the most democratic
constitution in Europe.</p>
<p>Every Norwegian town worth its sandbakkels celebrates it. In the
Driftless Area, you can catch a Syttende Mai festival in <a href="http://www.westbysyttendemai.com/">Westby,
Wis.</a></p>
<p>Across the Mississippi River, Decorah, Iowa, always celebrates <a href="https://vesterheim.org/program/syttende-mai-2019-05-17/">Syttende
Mai</a> on May 17.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/driving-lake-pepin/">Circling Lake Pepin</a></h3>
<p>This wide spot in the Mississippi River is a perennial favorite. From
Red Wing or Bay City, drivers on the road to Wabasha are never without a
view of blue water, green hillsides and limestone bluffs.</p>
<p>It's only 70 miles around, but there are too many places to see in one
day: the bakeries and galleries of Maiden Rock and Stockholm, the
National Eagle Center in Wabasha, the warblers and wildflowers in
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/frontenac/index.html">Frontenac State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>The area is especially busy the first weekend of May during the
<a href="http://www.100milegaragesale.org/">100-Mile Garage Sale</a>. In early
June, people can visit art studios and gardens on the Wisconsin side
during the <a href="http://www.freshart.org/">Fresh Art Spring Tour</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/taylors-falls-minnesota/">St. Croix River Valley</a></h3>
<p>This river, which joins the Mississippi at Prescott, Wis., forms the
border of Minnesota and Wisconsin and is less than an hour east of the
Twin Cities.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/hollandale_snow_white2.jpg" alt="Snow White and the Seven Dwarves at Grandview." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Snow White and her dwarves are among the concrete art at Grandview in
Hollandale.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From Prescott, cross the river and head up the Minnesota side to Afton
and <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/afton/index.html">Afton State
Park</a>. Next
up, hillside Stillwater has as many shops and bistros as anyone could
want.</p>
<p>In Marine on St. Croix, stop for pizza, coffee or ice cream, and hike
around Lake Alice in <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/william_obrien/index.html">William O'Brien State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/taylors-falls/">Taylors
Falls</a>,
weekend boat tours of the scenic Dalles start in May.</p>
<p>Across the river in Wisconsin, artists in and around St. Croix Falls
open their studios for the <a href="http://www.earthartswi.org/spring-art-tour/">Earth Arts Spring Art
Tour</a> the first weekend of
May. On the Minnesota side, more than 50 potters show their wares during
the <a href="http://www.minnesotapotters.com/">Pottery Studio Tour</a> the second
weekend of May <em>.</em></p>
<h3>MINNESOTA</h3>
<p>Minnesota has 10 state scenic byways, eight national scenic byways and
three national-forest scenic byways. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/minnesota-scenic-byways/">Minnesota's scenic
byways</a>.</p>
<h3>Spring ephemerals and <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/">Northfield</a></h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/nerstrand_trout_lily.jpg" alt="Trout lily at Nerstrand-Big Woods State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Northfield, Nerstrand Big Woods State Park is famous for its
bountiful trout lilies.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Less than an hour south of the Twin Cities, this college town always is
a good candidate for a drive.</p>
<p>There's an interesting assortment of shops on Division Street, and
it's always fun to visit the Historical Society Museum and see the
video re-enactment of the infamous Jesse James bank raid.</p>
<p>Spring is a good time to go a little farther to see one of the region's
best displays of spring wildflowers, at <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/nerstrand_big_woods/index.html">Nerstrand-Big Woods State
Park</a>. From downtown, take Division Street (Minnesota 246) south to County
Road 40 and into the park.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadtrips/bluff-country-minnesota-fall/">Bluff-country byways</a></h3>
<p>South of Rochester, the scenery starts. Hills sport outcroppings of
golden limestone, roads wind up and down and Amish buggies mingle with
other traffic.</p>
<p>May is a big month around
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Lanesboro</a>, Harmony and Preston, as trout fishermen, turkey hunters, bicyclists
and morel-mushroom pickers all converge on its picturesque countryside.</p>
<p>Artists throw open their studios during the <a href="http://www.bluffcountrystudioarttour.com/">Bluff Country Studio Arts
Tour</a> on the last weekend of
April.</p>
<p>Lanesboro's Saturday-morning farmers' market, which features many
Amish vendors, starts the first Saturday in May. On the third weekend in
May, Preston celebrates <a href="http://www.prestonmnchamber.com/play/events-festivals/trout-days/">Trout
Days</a>
and Whalan puts on its famous <a href="http://www.standstillparade.org/">Stand Still
Parade</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/a/taylors_falls_paddlewheeler.jpg" alt="A paddlewheeler on the St. Croix." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Follow Minnesota 16, also the <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/2240/maps">Historic Bluff Country Scenic
Byway</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/waterfalls-north-shore-minnesota/">Waterfalls of the North Shore</a></h3>
<p>In spring, the shores of Lake Superior can be 20 degrees cooler than
anywhere else in the state. The payoff is in the massive waterfalls
cascading through river gorges and into the big lake.</p>
<p>Start at Gooseberry Falls State Park and work your way northeast, all
the way to 120-foot High Falls on the Pigeon River, if you have time.
Often, you'll even see dozens of &quot;pop-up&quot; waterfalls spurting out of
roadside rock walls.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/otter-trails/">A hunt for giants</a></h3>
<p>In northwest Minnesota, Otter Tail County has not only more lakes than
any other county in Minnesota, but also the region's densest
concentration of giant mascots.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/starved_rock_view.jpg" alt="The view from Starved Rock." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Atop Starved Rock, a tourist looks across the Illinois River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Watch for a giant otter, a pelican, a warrior.</p>
<p>In the tiny village of Vining, a giant foot with an oversized big toe, a
square knot, a 20-foot clothespin, a pliers gripping a cockroach and,
our favorite, a coffee mug held up by a stream of molten java.</p>
<p>They're all stops on the <a href="https://visitfergusfalls.com/otter-trail-scenic-byway">Otter Trail Scenic
Byway</a>. You'll
also find two state parks, the picture-postcard Phelps Mill and and
Inspiration Peak, the state's second-highest point.</p>
<h3>NORTHERN ILLINOIS</h3>
<p>Illinois has seven national scenic byways, including a 435-mile segment
of the famous Route 66.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.lincolnhighwayassoc.org/info/il/">The Lincoln Highway</a></h3>
<p>The 179-mile section that crosses Illinois is a national scenic byway,
its route punctuated by historical murals in 30 towns.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/e/fergus_falls_otter.jpg" alt="A giant otter is Fergus Falls' mascot." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Fergus Falls, a 22-foot otter is a stop on the Otter Trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Linking New York's Times Square with Lincoln Park in San Francisco, it
became known as &quot;The Main Street Across America.&quot;</p>
<p>From Chicago Heights, the route heads east to Joliet, then along the Fox
River to Aurora, Batavia and Geneva. Then it heads west to DeKalb,
Rochelle and Dixon, hitting the Mississippi River at Fulton.</p>
<h3><a href="http://illinoisriverroad.org/maps.cfm">Along the Illinois River</a></h3>
<p>There's another great river road, and it's 291 miles in two sections.
The northern section of the Illinois River Road starts in Ottawa and
heads west along both sides of the river, passing Buffalo Rock, Starved
Rock and Matthiessen state parks before heading south to Chillicothe and
Peoria.</p>
<p>This stretch of river is lined by natural areas and wildlife refuges.
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/starved-rock-park-illinois/">Starved Rock State
Park</a>
is a must-stop. In May, waterfalls cascade over clifftops and canyons
are filled with bluebells.</p>
<h3>ILLINOIS/IOWA</h3>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mississippi-river-views/">Views of the Mississippi</a></h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/r/oregon_lincoln_highway.jpg" alt="A Lincoln Highway mural in Oregon." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Lincoln Highway mural in Oregon, Ill., features a 48-foot-tall
statue of Black Hawk.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A 50-mile loop along the Great River Road on both sides of the river
will provide spectacular views of barges, stone outcroppings, islands
and soaring eagles.</p>
<p>Stop to see the windmill in the Dutch town of Fulton, Ill., then head
north to Savanna and <a href="https://dnr.illinois.gov/Lands/Landmgt/PARKS/R1/PALISADE.HTM">Mississippi Palisades State
Park</a>,
winding up the steep park road to the river overlook.</p>
<p>Then backtrack to Savanna (or head another 30 miles north to Galena) and
cross the sloughs of the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife &amp;
Fish Refuge to Sabula, Iowa.</p>
<p>Then head south along the river's Pool 13 to Clinton, and cross back to
Fulton. If you can, catch Dutch Days Festival the first weekend of May.</p>
<h3>EASTERN IOWA</h3>
<p>Iowa has eight <a href="https://www.traveliowa.com/getinspireddetails/best-of-iowa-s-byways/238/">state scenic
byways</a>
and two <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/states/IA">national scenic
byways</a>, the Great River
Road and Loess Hills.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/maiden_rock_spring_drive.jpg" alt="Rustic Road 51 in spring." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Spring ephemerals line Rustic Road 51, near Maiden Rock on Lake Pepin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Besides the northern part of the Great River Road, four byways are in
northeast Iowa: River Bluffs, Driftless Area, Delaware Crossing and
Grant Wood.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.iowagreatriverroad.com/">Great River Road</a></h3>
<p>Drive
along the Mississippi River from the Minnesota border to Dubuque, and
you'll never again say that Iowa is flat. This is part of the Driftless
Area, which the last four glaciers missed while scraping down the rest
of the Midwest.</p>
<p>Most of the Great River Road hugs the Mississippi, but the parts that
veer inland are just as gorgeous, swooping up and down like a roller
coaster.</p>
<p>Stop in <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/lansing-iowa-mississippi/">Lansing</a> to take in the view
from Mount Hosmer City Park and, on the bluffs above Marquette, walk the
trails in <a href="http://www.nps.gov/efmo">Effigy Mounds National Monument</a>.</p>
<p>Then you'll come to <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mcgregor-iowa/">McGregor</a>, a quirky little town at river's edge, and another great view 500 feet
above it, from Pikes Peak State Park. Take County Road X56 to
Guttenberg, then C9Y to Balltown, which is not on the river but has an
astonishing view.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mission_orchard.jpg" alt="A cherry orchard on the Old Mission Peninsula." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Continue on to <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/dubuque-iowa-sightseeing/">Dubuque</a>, where you
can admire the view from the top of the Fenelon Place funicular.</p>
<h3>WESTERN MICHIGAN</h3>
<h3><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-119_%28Michigan_highway%29">Trilliums on the Tunnel of Trees</a></h3>
<p>Across the Mackinac Bridge and south of Mackinaw City, U.S. 31 barrels
straight south, but M-119 follows Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>It's 27½ miles between Harbor Springs and Cross Village on a road
that's twisting and narrow, barely wider than a bicycle trail (and, in
fact, watch for bicyclists).</p>
<p>In May, the woods along the drive are carpeted with trilliums, and
you'll get decent views of the lake through still-budding trees.</p>

<h3>Tulips in Holland</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tuliptime.com/">Tulip Time</a> festival in the Dutch city
of Holland stretches over the first two weekends in May, which makes it
easier to catch on a drive along Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>The Holland area has planted nearly 4.5 million tulips. See them on the
30-mile drive from South Haven through Saugatuck; you'll get to
sightsee and take a leisurely stroll in three beach towns that are
packed in summer.</p>
<h3>Cherry blossoms on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/old-mission-peninsula-michigan-spring/">Old Mission Peninsula</a></h3>
<p>On a narrow finger of land pointing north from Traverse City, thousands
of cherry trees bloom.</p>
<p>It's 19 miles to the tip of the peninsula and the 1870 Mission Point
Lighthouse. There's history as well as scenery here, along quiet roads
and dip and rise past horse farms, orchards and vineyards.</p>
<p>On the third Saturday in May, the <a href="https://www.ompwinetrail.com/">Old Mission Peninsula Wine
Trail</a> celebrates Blossom Day, with
tastings at all eight wineries.</p>
