<h2>In Wisconsin's coulee country, a green zone is known for morels, apples, wildflowers and a winding river.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/i/kickapoo_valley.jpg" alt="Spring in the Kickapoo Valley." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Roads in the area follow ridges, giving motorists lovely views of
valleys.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the coulees of southwest Wisconsin, a lush green zone draws anyone
who craves a heady dose of nature.</p>
<p>It starts in spring, when trilliums bloom along Rustic Roads, morel
mushrooms pop out on hillsides and water rushes down the crooked
Kickapoo River.</p>
<p>It's not close to any city, but people find their way. Norwegians were
first to be drawn to its deep, narrow valleys, like miniature fjords.</p>
<p>&quot;People who are from the flatlands sometimes feel claustrophobic
here,&quot; said Jonel Kiesau of the Kickapoo Valley Reserve near La Farge.
&quot;But if you're from this area, you feel hugged and cozy.&quot;</p>
<p>The river surges out of a vast watershed around Wilton, on the
Elroy-Sparta State Trail. It heads 11 miles south to Ontario, where
canoe outfitters launch flotillas of paddlers to Wildcat Mountain State
Park.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When they get there, six river miles later, they've paddled in all four
directions of the compass.</p>
<p>The river's famously twisting course is dictated by rock — old rock,
the skeleton of the continent, with all its bones poking through because
none of the last glaciers deposited any sediment to pad them.</p>
<p>Each glacier slid right around this corner of Wisconsin, from the Dells
to Dubuque, preserving its pointy hilltops and flat valleys and leaving
it without the glacial rubble, or drift, that covers the rest of the
region.</p>
<p>Now, this part of Wisconsin is known as the driftless area.</p>
<p>The Kickapoo Valley lies at its heart, and its unusual topography —
prairie savannah and marshes, cool valleys and sun-soaked cliffs —
make it hospitable to many rare plants and birds and more giant white
pines than can be seen anywhere outside the far north.</p>
<p>&quot;It's such a crazy place,&quot; said Jessica Bolwahn of the Mississippi
Valley Conservancy in La Crosse. &quot;You've got pockets of northern
species and pockets of southern species in a really small place.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/i/kickapoo_paddlers.jpg" alt="Canoeing the Kickapoo River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Yet this valley nearly became the sludge-covered bottom of a reservoir.
It often flooded — partly because rainwater flowed in from 140
tributaries and off its steep sandstone walls, but also because of
clear-cutting and poor farming practices — and the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers decided to build a dam.</p>
<p>It began buying land in 1969, condemning farms when owners resisted. But
in 1970, the Environmental Protection Act established requirements the
plan couldn't meet. After $18 million was spent and 140 families
forced from their homes, the project ground to a halt.</p>
<p>In 2001, the land between Wildcat Mountain State Park and La Farge
became the Kickapoo Valley Reserve, jointly owned by the state and the
Ho-Chunk Nation.</p>
<p>The Siouan Ho-Chunk, or Winnebago, were the most recent residents, but
the river is named for earlier residents, the Kickapoo, an Algonquian
nation whose name means &quot;one who moves there, then here.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, the 8,569-acre reserve is a green zone for fishing, hiking,
canoeing, bicycling and bird watching. Wetlands soak up rainwater and
serve as breeding habitat for more than 100 species of birds.</p>
<p>There's a visitor center, with exhibits and a push-button flood table.</p>

<h3>In search of birds</h3>
<p>One May weekend, we went on a bird walk out of the center with the
Wisconsin Society for Ornithology's Barb Duerksen, whose finely tuned
ear soon was picking out the calls of an Eastern towhee, a warbling
vireo and a blue-gray gnatcatcher.</p>
<p>As a sora called in the distance, Duerksen picked up two stones and
clicked them together, calling the marsh bird closer. Once she had done
the same thing at the same spot, she said, and &quot;it popped up right at
my feet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a really neat bird to see because it's so shy, and you don't
usually get a look at them,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Our trail led to a marsh, where we watched swallows, red-winged
blackbirds and two shy coots.</p>
<p>Old Highway 131 leads over the marsh and heads north through the
reserve, now a six-mile wilderness trail for bicyclists and hikers. On
the other end of the marsh, a covered bridge crosses the Kickapoo, one
of 12 bridges in the reserve.</p>
<p>After the bird walk, we decided to hike another section of Old Highway
131, where it hugs the river out of Rockton. The forest has engulfed the
old guardrail and crept over its edges, but on a drizzly day, the
asphalt road made the best possible trail.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/i/kickapoo_covered_bridge.jpg" alt="Birders on a covered bridge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Valley Reserve.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Birds chattered nonstop in the trees, and at the foot of a sandstone
cliff, a frog plopped into a puddle and sat there, staring at us. As we
walked to the next bridge, we thought how much fun it would be to ride
the whole route on a bike.</p>
<p>&quot;It's great, especially for families with younger kids,&quot; says Kiesau,
the reserve's education coordinator. &quot;It goes through so many
habitats.&quot;</p>
<p>Ecotourism now is a source of income for people in the valley. So is
organic farming, and its hub is just down the road from the visitor
center.</p>
<p>On a hillside above La Farge, the $6 million headquarters of the
Organic Valley cooperative, started in 1988 by seven Kickapoo Valley
farmers, now coordinates the output of hundreds of organic farmers in
two dozen states but still can't convert farms fast enough to meet
demand.</p>
<p>Since the rain didn't let up, we drove 30 miles farther down the
valley, admiring the roadside scenery. North of Viola, one green little
valley was particularly scenic.</p>
<p>&quot;In Nebraska, that would be a state park,&quot; my husband noted.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>An apple capital</h3>
<p>Our destination was Gays Mills, famous for its apple orchards, which are
covered with blossoms in May. It has an inviting main street, too, and
at the Village Greenhouse we stopped to buy perennials from pony-tailed
proprietor Joe Brandt.</p>
<p>&quot;Organic farming is taking off, which ties in to the hippies,&quot; he
said. &quot;We've got a lot of 'em here; we have a lot of earthy people.&quot;</p>
<p>At Kickapoo Exchange food co-op next door, we bought maple syrup from
Laura Negronida, a Chicagoan who came to Gays Mills after trying the
back-to-the-land lifestyle in California. The Kickapoo Valley, she said,
is blessed by its location, away from highways and big cities.</p>
<p>&quot;It's remote, which most people think of as the edge of somewhere,&quot;
Negronida said. &quot;This is remote by being in the middle of somewhere;
people just kind of go around it.&quot;</p>
<p>It was still raining the next day, so we drove the valley's two Rustic
Roads.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/trilliums.jpg" alt="Trilliums in spring." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In May, trilliums are abundant along the Kickapoo.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The trilliums had just started to come out on the steep sides of
Tunnelville Road, a three-mile channel of vegetation that descends
alongside a narrow valley that, through the trees, looked like a river
of grass.</p>
<p>Near Rustic Road 55's junction with Wisconsin 131, just south of La
Farge, a herd of Texas-style longhorn cattle grazed. We followed the
highway north to Rustic Road 56, which climbs a high ridge lined with
Amish farms; one was serving as church that Sunday, and there were
dozens of buggies parked outside.</p>
<p>At times like these, visitors may feel far from home.</p>

country</a>.</p>
<p><em>Hiking:</em> There are many miles of trails in the reserve and in the state
park.</p>
<p><em>Wildflowers</em> : They're easily seen along roads, the river, in the
reserve and in two state natural areas: the Tunnelville Cliffs, above
the East Branch of the Kickapoo, and Mount Pisgah Hemlock-Hardwoods in
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/wildcat/">Wildcat Mountain State
Park</a>.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Morel mushrooms</em> : They're abundant but elusive, as they are
everywhere; try the reserve or state park. Typically, they peak around
Mother's Day.</p>
<p>If you can't find any, buy some at the <a href="http://viroquafood.coop/">Viroqua Food
Co-op</a>, the Kickapoo Exchange Natural Food
Co-op in Gays Mills or at the Morel Mushroom Festival in Muscoda on the
Wisconsin River in mid-May.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations:</em> There are many cabins and cottages for rent, and it's
handy to have a kitchen since restaurants are limited.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kvranch.com/">Kickapoo Valley Ranch</a> rents eight
well-appointed cabins.</p>
<p>I've stayed at <a href="http://www.trilliumcottage.com/">Trillium B&amp;B</a> on a
ridge outside La Farge, which has two cottages, 608-625-4492.</p>
<p>In Soldiers Grove, the renovated 1923 <a href="https://www.tobaccowarehouseinn.com/">Tobacco Warehouse
Inn</a> has six suites, some with
kitchens.</p>
<p><em>Camping:</em> There are 25 primitive campsites in the Kickapoo Valley
Reserve, $10 for up to 10 people. They're first come, first served.
Campsites are also available at <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/wildcat/">Wildcat Mountain State
Park</a>, 608-337-4775.</p>
<p>In Gays Mills, there's camping in <a href="http://www.gaysmills.org/robbpark.html">Robb
Park</a> next to the Kickapoo,
$15-$25. There are flush toilets, and some sites have electricity.
