<h2>On Lake Superior, an isolated peninsula yields up all sorts of riches.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/a/eagle_harbor_lighthouse2.jpg" alt="Eagle Harbor Light on the Keweenaw." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>On Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula, distance is both curse and blessing.</p>
<p>Jutting deep into Lake Superior, it's far from big cities - for
Detroit residents, Nashville and Washington, D.C., are closer than the
Keweenaw (pronounced KEY-win-awe).</p>
<p>It was &quot;beyond the most distant wilderness and remote as the moon,&quot;
statesman Patrick Henry told Congress after early mining attempts were
abandoned in 1771.</p>
<p>But its deposits of pure copper were the world's largest, and in 1843,
a copper rush brought in workers from dozens of nations. By 1913, 60,000
people lived in Calumet, extracting millions of pounds of copper for
Calumet &amp; Hecla Mining Co.</p>
<p>But a failed strike that year soured life for workers, and declining
demand, low prices and another strike ended the mining era for good in
1968.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Now, the Keweenaw merits only an occasional blip on the national radar.</p>
<p>Backpackers know that Copper Harbor is the jumping-off point for Isle
Royale National Park, and park headquarters is in Houghton, a college
town that National Geographic Adventure magazine called one of the
nation's Top 10 &quot;gateway towns&quot; for summer sports.</p>
<p>Besides hiking on Isle Royale, there's scuba diving to the shipwrecks
of the Keweenaw Underwater Preserve, kayaking on the Keweenaw Water
Trail and mountain biking on old mining and logging roads around Copper
Harbor and Calumet.</p>
<p>But most people come to the Keweenaw simply to explore.</p>
<p>Then, they see why distance is a blessing. There are no condo or
townhouse developments, no luxury resorts, no weekend McMansions taking
up shoreline.</p>
<p>Instead, there are blueberry patches, wildflowers and quiet beaches.
There are twisting roads under canopies of trees. There are villages
where working people live, and an 1844 fort where interpreters play
working people of the past.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/houghton_bridge.jpg" alt="boats sail under lift bridge in Houghton, Mich." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Portage Lake Lift Bridge connects Houghton and Hancock.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>And there are tourists, of course. They visit the 10 lighthouses, tour
the mines and cruise along Brockway Mountain Drive, renowned for fall
color.</p>
<p>They stop at the Jampot near Eagle River, where the cloaked monks of the
Society of St. John do a brisk business in ginger muffins, brownies and
oatmeal cookies.</p>
<p>They snap photos of bear cubs ambling along U.S. 41, which follows the
high ridge between Calumet and Copper Harbor.</p>
<p>But many of the &quot;tourists&quot; go way, way back.</p>
<p>&quot;We like to ask new people how they found us,&quot; says Chris Kvale, who
runs the Lake Breeze inn in Eagle Harbor with his wife, Marcia Raley.
&quot;It's interesting how many people have connections to Copper
Country.&quot;</p>
<p>Raley's great-grandfather, Judge William Raley, built a lakefront
warehouse in 1859 that his youngest son, Austin, turned into a lodge in
1923.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>His son Frank and Frank's wife, Helen, took it over, and their daughter
Marcia Raley spent carefree summers there in the '50s and '60s, often
joining guest families on their excursions.</p>
<p>Now she and Kvale drive up each summer from their Minneapolis home and
open it for appreciative guests, many of whom come back year after year.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a strong sense of place here, an attachment to the land,&quot;
she says. &quot;People come back for generations.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of her father's side of the family, however, joined an exodus that
accelerated in the 1920s, when the automotive plants around Detroit
began hiring en masse.</p>
<p>&quot;My great-grandfather said to his kids, 'Get out of this place. Mining
is dead. Lumber is gone. There are no resources,'&quot;she said. &quot;They all
left, except for my grandfather.&quot;</p>
<p>The Keweenaw is bustling no longer. But it holds many beauties,
including remnants of its industrial past.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/u/p/up_vintage_postcard_small.jpg" alt="A vintage postcard of the Upper Peninsula." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The first thing people see when they crest the hill above Houghton is
the giant 1908 shaft house of the Quincy Mine, looming on the opposite
hill above Hancock.</p>
<p>Below, the massive, double-deck Portage Lake Lift Bridge crosses the
shipping canal that separates the two towns; Keweenaw is an Ojibwe word
for &quot;place where one crosses.&quot;</p>
<p>From Hancock, the highway winds up the hill past Finlandia University,
the nation's only college founded by Finns, and heads toward Calumet.
Only a little more than 700 people live there now, plus nearly 2,000 in
adjoining Laurium, but many of the stately brick and red sandstone
buildings remain.</p>
<p>One of them is the Calumet Theatre, an 1899 opera house that's still a
performing-arts showcase, especially during the Pine Mountain Music
Festival in the summer.</p>
<p>It's also part of the Keweenaw National Historical Park, along with
Coppertown USA mining museum. Inside the museum, exhibits tell how
Calumet &amp; Hecla ran the town, building schools, churches, clinics,
bathhouses and recreational fields for their employees. It also owned
their houses and operated the stores.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/e/keweenaw_thermometer.jpg" alt="A giant thermometer on the Keweenaw." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>In the schools, it trained students in the skills the company needed.
Today, a historical plaque outside Washington School reads &quot;From Minors
to Miners.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The company giveth, but the company also taketh away,&quot; said Peter
Manzini, who was at the museum showing his grandson a re-creation of the
C&amp;H hospital. His father worked briefly in the mines, he said, but then
took over an Italian grocery in Calumet.</p>
<p>&quot;They made millions, but they took it all away, those Bostonians,&quot; he
said. &quot;My father saw to it that no one in the family worked in the
mines. It was a terrible life; terrible.&quot;</p>
<p>When he grew up, Manzini left Calumet to work in Detroit. But he
returned when he retired, drawn by vivid childhood memories of the busy
town.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, things were really going here then,&quot; he says wistfully.</p>
<p>Many people come back every year for Calumet's Heritage Celebration.
And in Central, a virtual ghost town after the rich Central Mine closed
in 1898, descendants of the original Cornish miners have been holding
annual reunions since 1907.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The loveliest parts of the Keweenaw are farther north, along the lake.
Fog-shrouded Eagle River is the county seat, with an 1866 Greek Revival
courthouse rising incongruously amid a meager collection of houses.</p>
<p>Thanks to surveys by state geologist Douglass Houghton, it became the
first boomtown in 1845, the same year 37-year-old Houghton drowned in
the lake, caught in an open boat by a nor'easter.</p>
<p>Today, tourists come to see Eagle River Falls, watch ore boats from the
cobblestone beach and buy fudge and ice cream at the Eagle River General
Store, open since 1867.</p>
<p>Seven miles up the road, Eagle Harbor is the peninsula's most charming
town, with a classic red-brick lighthouse, built in 1871, and a
well-protected harbor lined by a sandy swimming beach.</p>
<p>Father Frederic Baraga stayed at the old general store here, and at the
1853 schoolhouse across the harbor, a young teacher formed a dramatic
society that evolved into the Knights of Pythias, a secret fraternity
that performed charitable works.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/a/eagle_harbor_esrey_park.jpg" alt="Esrey Park on the Keweenaw Peninsula." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
North of Eagle Harbor, Esrey Park is a favorite picnic spot.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Eagle Harbor, the luckiest people stay at the 1859 Lake Breeze, which
its owners have gracefully brought into the present without sacrificing
character.</p>
<p>On the lake, it sits at the edge of the rocky shoreline; around the
corner, a long covered porch faces the harbor. Above the entrance, a
birch log carries the motto, &quot;Park Your Cares Outside.&quot;</p>
<p>Kayaks are parked on the grass, near overflowing flower boxes and
'50s-style metal chairs on which guests can watch for the eagles that
nest across the harbor. Inside, the aroma of balsam fir fills the tiny
lobby, and friends meet beside the fire to play cards or gaze at the
lake through picture windows.</p>
<p>Only a small sign at the edge of an unpaved drive points to the 10-room
lodge, where a hedge surrounds a small parking area. Raley and Kvale
barely advertise, but people find them anyway.</p>
<p>From Eagle Harbor, a two-lane road hugs the lake, passing Agate Beach,
Dan's Point and Esrey Roadside Park on its way to Copper Harbor.</p>
<p>In June, the resort village unrolls for tourists, who visit the gift
shops, take narrated cruises to the 1866 lighthouse and visit the 1844
fort at Fort Wilkins State Park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/houghton_downtown.jpg" alt="Downtown Houghton." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The college town of Houghton is the largest on the peninsula.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At Fort Wilkins, costumed interpreters play the roles of the military
folk who whiled away their days there, sent first to handle Indian
hostility and mining strife that never materialized and later to wait
out Civil War enlistments.</p>
<p>Some golf on the hilly course at Keweenaw Mountain Lodge, built by the
Works Progress Administration in the 1930s, or go hiking in Estivant
Pines, a nature sanctuary in virgin forest just outside town.</p>
<p>But the white pines are perhaps more impressive just around the
peninsula, where their feathery branches stand out against open sky on
the lake-hugging road between Bete Grise and Gay.</p>
<p>Bete Grise has a long public beach, with picnic tables and changing
rooms. But people who use the pullouts on the road to Gay and walk down
to the shore will have a private beach all their own, complete with
blueberry patches, driftwood seating and sand that blends into a red
sandstone shelf that's so soft it rubs off on toes.</p>
<p>Even on summer weekends, there's barely any traffic. For a long time,
mining and paper companies owned most of the land, and anyone could use
it for berry picking and agate hunting. More of it is up for grabs now,
but so far, development has been low-key.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/e/keweenaw_rocks.jpg" alt="The rock beach on Oliver Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Egg yolk-like rock is set into the soft beach rock on Oliver Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>That leaves its treasures intact for people who take the trouble to find
them.</p>
<p>&quot;This area, partly because of its remoteness, never has been the place
to go,&quot; Marcia Raley says. &quot;But the explorers get here.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula</h3>
<p><em>When to go:</em> By July, the black flies have mostly passed through, and
it's warm enough to swim in shallow coves.</p>
<p>In late July and early August, you can pick blueberries and
thimbleberries, and bear sightings are likely.</p>
<p>Fall is gorgeous, and there's ample snow in winter for skiers and
snowmobilers.</p>
