<h2>In far northern Minnesota, a scenic byway is a showcase for the outdoors.</h2>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Exploring the Minnesota landscape on a scenic byway, you'd expect to
see some singular features.</p>
<p>But Waters of the Dancing Sky Scenic Byway turns up a whole new face.</p>
<p>This is a burly part of the state, a scratchy-wool, buffalo-plaid kind
of place that might seem Bunyanesque in nature but actually was the
stomping grounds of a real-life legend, the shorter but tougher
voyageur.</p>
<p>First traversed by Europeans, this strip of Minnesota was one of the
last places to be settled in America.</p>
<p>Today, it's still a frontier, at least at its two ports of entry into
Canada, and its residents still revel in the outdoors, powered by
engines instead of paddles.</p>
<p>A 229-mile stretch of highway, this scenic byway was conceived in part
as a showcase for the showy lady's slippers and yellow moccasin orchids
that spring up along its ditches in June, and it has its share of
roadside wildflowers throughout the summer.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In August, the sunflower crop ripens, and the fields are ablaze with
bluegrass — literally ablaze, as in flaming. When I was traveling
through, the grass seeds had been harvested and the stalks set afire to
encourage growth for the next season.</p>
<p>All along the road from Roseau to Warroad, flames licked up from
jet-black soil, creating billows of smoke that nearly obscured the
late-afternoon sun.</p>
<h3>Capital cities</h3>
<p>Up here, a traveler sees many unusual things. There's a Hummer on tank
treads sitting at a junction in Karlstad, next to the Mattracks
rubber-track conversion-systems plant and around the corner from Murphy
the Moose, which stands next to a sign proclaiming Karlstad to be
&quot;Moose Capital of the North.&quot;</p>
<p>Down the road, Greenbush is the start of the stretch known for orchids,
but in August there was nothing to be seen along the road but thousands
of overheated turkeys, lying in piles under shade trees.</p>
<p>Badger is just a tiny burg, but it claims to be &quot;Mallard Capital of
Minnesota.&quot;</p>
<p>Roseau could put a claim on &quot;Hockey Capital of Minnesota,&quot; but first
it would have to duke it out with Warroad. It's also the home of
Polaris Industries, manufacturer of snowmobiles and ATVs, the main
conveyances for fun in the woods.</p>

<p>&quot;If you don't like to do things outdoors, I don't know what you're
going to find to do in Roseau,&quot; said Eveline Gordon, a clerk at
Annie's Trading Post.</p>
<p>Annie's, she said, &quot;is kind of an anomaly in these parts&quot; — from
its start as a scrap-metal yard, it expanded into furs, then seafood and
now also carries gifts and sportswear as well as casually stylish
women's apparel that would be snapped up in the Twin Cities. The local
women aren't sold on it, though, says Gordon.</p>
<p>&quot;They're so conservative,&quot; she says. &quot;The Woolrich woman is afraid
to wear something unusual.&quot;</p>
<p>Roseau's hockey archrival, Warroad, is 20 miles down the road, on Lake
of the Woods. Like Roseau, it's dominated by a single industry, Marvin
Windows.</p>
<p>The many Marvin buildings overshadow the town, which seems low on
houses. More people live within a five-mile radius than within the town
limits, says Kathie Quinn of the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>She says they're looking for lake views, hunting grounds or privacy —
or perhaps, like her, they enjoy watching for wildlife and seeing the
northern lights for which the scenic byway is named.</p>
<p>&quot;Just last week, we were all sitting out in the yard watching them,&quot;
Quinn says. &quot;It was gorgeous.&quot;</p>
<p>On the lakefront, Warroad's City Park is the first stop on the 223-mile
Pine to Prairie Birding Trail, with two observation towers that provide
a bird's-eye view into the surrounding marshes.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the 18th century, the town site was on the fur-trade route between
Lake Winnipeg and the Great Lakes, and in 1732, Pierre Gaultier de
Varennes, Sieur de la Verendrye, built a palisaded fort on an island to
the north.</p>
<p>In City Park, a plaque commemorates the day in 1736 when a Dakota war
party killed la Verendrye's eldest son, a priest and 17 voyageurs on a
nearby island, severing their heads and wrapping them in beaver pelts.</p>
<p>It was retaliation for la Verendrye's alliances with the Cree and
Assiniboine. Later, the Dakota fought with the Ojibwe for use of the
surrounding wild-rice fields, traveling in from the west on the Red and
Roseau rivers, or war road.</p>
<h3>Grist for legends</h3>
<p>From Warroad, the scenic byway continues east to Williams, &quot;Orchid
Capital of the Nation&quot; and home of the Williams Garden Club, which
marks the best roadside displays of blooms for the Wildflower
Celebration in June.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/n/international_falls_smokey_bear.jpg" alt="Smokey Bear is International Falls' mascot." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>A short detour to Zippel Bay State Park yields more wildflowers — four
species of lady's slippers and many other orchids in June and July, and
later, bottle gentian, seneca snakeroot and fireweed.</p>
<p>Named for one of the early settlers, sturgeon fishermen who sent their
fish to markets as far away as New York, Zippel Bay has one of the
state's most spectacular beaches.</p>
<p>Today, Lake of the Woods is better known for walleye, and Baudette has a
whopper. It's just one of many towns claiming to be &quot;Walleye Capital
of the World,&quot; but its 40-foot Willie Walleye seems to be the largest
— in concrete, anyway.</p>
<p>From Baudette, a bridge crosses the Rainy River to Ontario. In Baudette,
a traveler can pick up cans of Malkin's jams, McIntosh toffee — and
French voices, wafting over the airwaves on Radio Canada.</p>
<p>The scenic byway is most scenic along the Rainy River, on the way to the
Falls. Franz Jevne State Park is a mile detour, right on the river.</p>
<p>There's no attendant, no visitor center and no plaque to explain its
significance, but the rapids on which it sits was a gathering place for
North America's indigenous people, who came to its shores to fish for
sturgeon, reconnect with relatives and bury their dead.</p>
<p>The largest concentration of burial mounds in Canada can be found on the
opposite shore, a National Historic Site that's now part of the grounds
of Kah-Nah-Chi-Wah-Nung, an impressive heritage center with a
roundhouse, museum, restaurant and trails.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There are mounds on the American side, too, the largest concentration in
the Upper Midwest. They're just down the road, and once, people could
learn about them at the Grand Mound Historic Site, run by the Minnesota
Historical Society. Thanks to budget cuts, it's closed.</p>
<p>Just east of Franz Jevne State Park, travelers pass Basshenge, a
roadside collection of 21 steel sculptures of string basses erected by
local cabin owner Joseph Guastafeste, principal bassist for the Chicago
Symphony Orchestra.</p>
<p>Soon, traffic includes trucks stacked with logs, headed for the giant
Boise paper mill in International Falls. The forests are everything in
the Falls, supplying livelihood, identity and recreation, so a 26-foot
fiberglass Smokey the Bear is the town mascot.</p>
<p>Flanked by two cubs, Smokey stands at the end of downtown, just across
the street from the Koochiching Museums. Inside, exhibits draw tourists
from around the nation, many of them curious about the town's legendary
status as &quot;Icebox of the Nation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We just had to come to International Falls, because we always see it
on the news,&quot; said Shirley Rider of Maitland, Fla.</p>
<p>The other half of the museum is about local son Bronko Nagurski. This
Bunyanesque athlete made Ripley's &quot;Believe It or Not&quot; in 1937 for
being world champion in two sports at the same time, as a heavyweight
wrestler and an unstoppable fullback for the Chicago Bears — &quot;the
only ball carrier I've ever seen who ran his own interference,&quot;
according to an opposing coach.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But Nagurski was modest, declining to let the local high school football
team use his name; it had to settle for Broncos, with a bucking pony as
a mascot.</p>
<p>Of fame, he said, &quot;I just take it or leave it. It doesn't do anything
for me.&quot;</p>
<p>After his playing days were over, he came back to International Falls.
He raised a family and spent his spare time hunting and fishing,
enjoying the outdoors.</p>
<p>For people along this stretch of highway, that's the good life.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: <a href="http://watersofdancingsky.com/">Waters of the Dancing Sky Scenic Byway</a></h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : Between Karlstad and
Voyageurs National Park, just east of International Falls, the scenic
byway is 191 miles.</p>
<p>From Hallock through Lake Bronson State Park, on the west end of the
byway, it's 229 miles. Each end is roughly 5½ hours from the Twin
Cities.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> <strong>:</strong> Most of the lodgings along this stretch are
franchise motels. Just east of Zippel Bay, in the woods of Wheeler's
Point, <a href="http://www.wildwoodinnbb.com">Wildwood Inn</a> is an abundantly
decorated traditional B&amp;B with five rooms.</p>
<p>At the end of the byway near International Falls, <a href="http://www.shashaonrainylake.com/">Sha-Sha
Resort</a> has pleasant cabins with
screened gazebos and dining on a series of decks overlooking Rainy
Lake.</p>
