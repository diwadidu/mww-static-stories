<h2>On the Mississippi River between Minnesota and Wisconsin, a favorite driving route leads to some real treats.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/maiden_rock_bluff.jpg" alt="The view from Maiden Rock Bluff." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From the Maiden Rock Bluff state natural area, hikers have a spectacular
view of Lake Pepin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Along the shores of Lake Pepin, villages like to play a game called
&quot;Tempt the Tourist.&quot;</p>
<p>The tourists think they're going to go for a drive and see some scenery.
But the villages give them so many places to indulge themselves, they
end up mostly eating and shopping — not that anyone's complaining.</p>
<p>The highway around Lake Pepin is a gantlet of temptations — bakeries,
bistros, wine bars and gift shops. Some people never make it beyond
Stockholm in Wisconsin or Red Wing in Minnesota, just an hour from the
Twin Cities.</p>
<p>But this is the kind of place where it's fun to spin your wheels.</p>
<p>Lake Pepin actually is a 26-mile-long wide spot on the Mississippi,
created by the delta of the Chippewa River across from Reads Landing,
Minn.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Early explorers were quick to extol its beauty, and when steamboats
began traveling upriver in the 1820s, settlements sprang up to supply
travelers with wood and food.</p>
<p>General stores replaced wharves, then gave way to shops, galleries and
cafes that cater to tourists. Today, visitors have an array of choices
that's as expansive as the views.</p>
<p>It's a 70-mile drive around Lake Pepin, making it a perfect day trip.
We start in <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Red Wing</a>,
and our first stop is Old West Main Street, near Pottery Place, to pick
up baked goods or a picnic lunch.</p>
<p>If it's a fine day, we can take our picnic lunch to Bay Point Park to
watch the river traffic or up to Barn Bluff for a
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mississippi-river-views/">view</a> of the river valley.</p>
<p>Or we can drive across the bridge to Wisconsin and head along the Great
River Road to <em>Maiden Rock</em> , where we hope that Smiling Pelican Bakery
won't be out of its Viennese lemon tart.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_city_paddlewheeler.jpg" alt="The Pearl of the Lake cruise boat." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From Lake City, the Pearl of the Lake paddlewheeler gives tours.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Often it is, so we'll split a piece of three-berry pie in the bountiful
perennial garden.</p>
<p>The best shopping is down the road in tiny
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/stockholm-lake-pepin/">Stockholm</a>, jammed into the shadow of the bluff. In the 1980s, artisans and
shopkeepers began renovating the old clapboard and limestone buildings
and turning them into galleries; that drew more artists.</p>
<p>Stockholm Pottery &amp; Mercantile has been open since 1991 and showcases
the work of potter Diane Milner and local artists. So does Abode, a
fine-arts gallery across the road.</p>
<p>Up the street, the Stockholm Pie Company sells pie — savory ones as
well as fruits and creams — and also ice cream.</p>
<p>They're all within a few steps of the intersection of Wisconsin 35 and
Spring Street. A block down the highway, the Palate sells gourmet treats
and cookware and offers cooking classes.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The next town, <em>Pepin</em> , has been a popular day-trip destination for
people from the Twin Cities and Rochester since the <a href="http://www.harborviewpepin.com/">Harbor View
Cafe</a> opened in 1980. It exerts such a
pull that its annual reopening in mid-March signals the start of the
tourist season on Lake Pepin.</p>
<p>Hopeful diners often have to wait hours for a table, a boon for the
shops that have sprung up nearby.</p>
<p>Pepin also is the birthplace of <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ingalls-wilder/">Laura Ingalls
Wilder</a>. There's a
Laura Ingalls Wilder Historical Museum in town, a repository of
Laura-era artifacts. The author was born seven miles up the bluffs,
where her family's cabin is re-created at the Little House Wayside.</p>
<p>Down the highway from Pepin, the <em>Nelson</em> Cheese Factory has been making
cheese for more than a century, but it's kept up with the times.</p>
<p>First, it offered sandwiches and ice cream to passing tourists, then a
large array of imported gourmet goods, and now a patio and a fireplace
room where customers can sip wine and listen to jazz.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_city_apple_store.jpg" alt="The Pepin Heights shop in Lake City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Pepin Heights store sells produce from its Lake City orchard.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Across the bridge,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagles-wabasha/">Wabasha</a> is the only
town not bisected by a highway. For a long time, it retained the feel of
the 1950s along its riverside Main Street, where the 1856 Anderson House
was Minnesota's longest continuously operating hotel.</p>
<p>Tourists come year-round to see the five resident eagles at the National
Eagle Center and to watch eagles swoop out of nearby cottonwoods. Others
come to the shop Wind Whisper West, which sells kimonos most buyers
display as art.</p>
<p>Just up the river, tiny <em>Reads Landing</em> is an even better place to spot
eagles. You can do that right from your table at the <a href="http://www.rlbrewingco.com/">Reads Landing
Brewing Company</a>, which occupies an 1869
brick storefront on the river.</p>
<p>Just up the road, <strong>Lake City</strong> is the apple
capital, and its Pepin Heights is Minnesota's largest orchard; in fall,
stop at its store on the highway to pick up a bushel of HoneyCrisps.</p>
<p>On Lake Pepin, you can take your tastebuds around the world and back in
a single day.</p>

<p><em>Getting there:</em> Red Wing is an hour southeast of the Twin Cities. On
the south end, Wabasha is an hour and a half northwest of La Crosse.</p>
<p>For more about towns south of Wabasha, see our <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/mississippi-valley/">Mississippi Valley
section</a>.</p>
<p><em>When to go:</em> The spring season starts unofficially when the Harbor
View Cafe in Pepin opens on the second or third weekend of March, and
most shops are open Friday through Sunday.</p>
<p>Weekends are busy in summer; Thursdays and Fridays are a good time to
visit because there's less motorcycle traffic.</p>
<p>A few shops close for a day early in the week, but most stay open daily
through October, then weekends through Christmas. Many close for winter
and reopen for weekends in late March.</p>
