<h2>For stressed-out city folks, the shore of Lake Superior is hallowed ground.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/north_shore_rock_shore.jpg" alt="Lichen spots the craggy basalt rocks lining the North Shore." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The North Shore is lined with lichen-covered volcanic rock.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Ten thousand years ago, the melting of Minnesota's last glacier
transformed a placid beach into a rugged coast.</p>
<p>It's a 150-mile stretch of wild beauty, lined by piles of jagged black
basalt, cobblestone beaches and the mouths of dozens of rivers, tumbling
down from the old beaches of Glacial Lake Duluth.</p>
<p>Seven state parks follow their winding gorges, marked by rapids and
waterfalls, and the Superior Hiking Trail crosses them on its way from
Duluth to the Canadian border.</p>
<p>This is Minnesota's breathing space, to which tourists return like
spawning salmon, year after year, or whenever we need to fill our lungs
with brisk Lake Superior air.</p>
<p>We can't really swim in the water — it's usually about 40 degrees,
even in summer — but we can look at the views and walk through the
forests, and we do.</p>
<p>The romance of crashing waves and wooded solitude makes the North Shore
a favorite honeymoon and anniversary destination, but its popularity is
universal.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Only a few decades ago, most visitors stayed in mom-and-pop resorts,
usually a string of small cabins perched on the rocky shore. The
traditional spots since have been joined — and often supplanted by —
upscale condos and townhouses.</p>
<p>But the North Shore still is primarily for people who just want to be
outdoors.</p>
<p>There's so much to see and do that planning a trip can be hard. It helps
to know where the highlights are; for distances between state parks,
attractions and towns.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-minnesota/trip-planning-north-shore-minnesota/">North Shore by the
mile</a>.</p>
<p>The first stretch, on Old Highway 61 between Duluth and Two Harbors,
retains the feel of the old shore and has many old-fashioned resorts.</p>
<p>In spring, fishermen flock to the French, Sucker and Knife rivers for
smelt, salmon and trout. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/north-shore-scenic-highway/">Minnesota's scenic
61</a>.</p>
<p>The next stretch holds the densest concentration of scenery. Minnesota
61 passes through two tunnels cut through rock and over the waterfalls
of Gooseberry State Park, Minnesota's most-visited outstate park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/e/temperance_mouth_swimmers.jpg" alt="Swimmers at the mouth of the Temperance River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Temperance River was named because its mouth on Lake Superior has no
bar.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Split Rock Lighthouse, just up the road, is the most-photographed spot
on the shore and probably the state.</p>
<p>At Palisade Head, sheer pink cliffs rise from the lake, lining the shore
to Shovel Point at Tettegouche State Park. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/gooseberry-to-tettegouche/">The near North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>The stretch between Schroeder and Lutsen attracts a well-heeled crowd to
the cushy resorts and condos around Lutsen Mountains.</p>
<p>Many of the shore's most popular hiking trails are here, along the
Temperance, Onion and Poplar rivers, as well as Eagle Mountain, the
state's highest point. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">Hiking the North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>Grand Marais was founded by fur traders, loggers and fishermen and still
is the favorite spot of die-hard outdoors people, especially
cross-country skiers. It's also the beginning of the Gunflint Trail and
one of the gateways to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.</p>
<p>Hiking around here, especially around the Devil Track, Kadunce and Brule
rivers, is the most dramatic of the shore. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Four seasons
of Grand
Marais</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Few venture beyond Grand Marais, but those who do will be rewarded. Two
centuries ago, Grand Portage was a fur-trading metropolis, and Grand
Portage National Monument re-creates its colorful past in and around a
reconstructed stockade.</p>
<p>Next door, ferries leave for Isle Royale National Park, one of the
nation's best backpacking destinations. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/visiting-grand-portage/">Life on the
Grand
Portage</a>.</p>
<p>Six miles north, in Grand Portage State Park, the 120-foot High Falls of
the Pigeon River cascade over a sheer basalt face. This is the
unpassable chasm that forced the Ojibwe to make a 8½-mile grand detour,
a route the voyageurs later adopted to reach the fur-rich interior.</p>
<p>The British-owned North West Company post moved across the border in
1803, and that era is re-created at Fort William Historical Park, where
costumed interpreters work their magic in and around the continent's
largest reconstructed post.</p>
<p>It's just one of the attractions of Thunder Bay, the largest city on
Lake Superior and the most ethnically diverse. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/thunder-bay-summer/">Exploring
Thunder Bay</a>.</p>
<p>According to Canadians, the real North Shore starts there; it is, of
course, the north shore of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>But that's another story: For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/circle-tour-lake-superior/">Circling
Superior</a>.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Minnesota's North Shore</h3>
<p><em>Driving distances</em> : For a mile-by-mile guide to the landmarks of the
North Shore, from Canal Park in Duluth at 0.0 to the Canadian border at
150.0, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-minnesota/trip-planning-north-shore-minnesota/">North Shore by the
mile</a>.</p>
<p>It's 24 miles from Duluth to Two Harbors, then another 16 miles to
Gooseberry Falls, 6 miles to Split Rock Lighthouse, 12 miles to
Tettegouche State Park, 24 miles to Tofte and 7 miles to Lutsen.</p>
<p>From Lutsen, it's 10 miles to Cascade River State Park, 10 miles to
Grand Marais, 14 miles to Judge C.R. Magney State Park/Naniboujou, 21
miles to Grand Portage National Monument and 6 miles to the Canadian
border.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : Peak season along the North Shore is summer, when people
from all over the nation come to bask in the cool breezes of Lake
Superior. Bring a jacket and pants even in July and August; nights can
be cold, even around the traditional shore bonfire.</p>
<p>Fall weekends are even busier, when throngs come up to hike and see the
hardwood forest burst into color. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-colors-north-shore/">Colors of the North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>Late October and early November is an excellent time to hike; muddy
trails harden, falling leaves open up new vistas, the bugs are gone and
hotel rates drop. Just remember to wear blaze-orange — deer firearm
season starts in early November.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/north-shore-late-fall/">Quiet time on the North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>In winter, the North Shore is a sports paradise, with hundreds of miles
of trails for downhill skiing, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and
snowmobiling.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/ski-north-shore-minnesota/">Skiing the North
Shore</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-north-shore/">North Shore by
snowshoe</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_harbors_lighthouse_point_rock.jpg" alt="Lighthouse Point in Two Harbors." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Volcanic rock on Two Harbor's Lighthouse Point slides into Lake
Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When there's not enough snow, trails and frozen rivers are fine places
to hike. Temperatures along the shore are 10 degrees warmer than they
are inland, thanks to heat held by the lake, but biting winds often
erase the advantage.</p>
<p>The ski season at Lutsen Mountains extends into mid-April. But away from
the Lutsen area, prices at many hotels drop to half-price in March.
However, spring weather is unpredictable at best, and trails are
sloppy.</p>
<p>The best bet in spring is late May and the first half of June, when
wildflowers appear in the forests. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/wildflowers-spring-north-shore/">Wildflowers of the
North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>However, black flies may be a problem inland, away from lake breezes.
Mosquitoes also come out in force then. In most spots, both die down by
August.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : See <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/north-shore-lodgings/">Where to stay on Minnesota's North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>Make reservations as early as possible for summer and fall, weekdays as
well as weekends.</p>
<p>Reserve a year in advance for weekends during peak color season, the
last weekend of September and the first weekend of October. Color peaks
first inland, and that's where maples provide the most vivid reds and
oranges.</p>
<p>On the third weekend of October, Minnesota schoolchildren have a
four-day break, and the entire North Shore books up.</p>
<p>In winter, reserve a few weeks in advance for the best selection on ski
weekends.</p>
