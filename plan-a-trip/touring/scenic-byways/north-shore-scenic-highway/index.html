<h2>The old stretch of highway to Two Harbors is a rustic remnant of the old North Shore.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/u/sucker_river_bridge.jpg" alt="Bridges over the Sucker River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At the French River, people explore under the highway and train trestle.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Thanks to a four-lane stretch of Minnesota 61, tourists can zoom up to
Two Harbors from Duluth in 15 minutes flat.</p>
<p>The question is, why would anyone want to?</p>
<p>There's much more to see along this 19-mile stretch of old 61, a part
of the North Shore that has changed little in the last few decades.
It's not the fanciest part, but it may be the most genuine.</p>
<p>The 11 miles of shoreline from the Lester River to Stony Point are
undeveloped, thanks to Glensheen magnate Chester Congdon, who donated it
to Duluth with the stipulation that nothing would ever come between
highway travelers and their view of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Except for angling and boat-watching, not much goes on there, which is
how Congdon wanted it.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Fishermen haunt the mouths of the Lester, French and Sucker rivers at
dawn, angling for trout and salmon. In May they wait, along with
hundreds of ducks, for the smelt to run up the Lester and Knife.</p>
<p>In fall, they wait for Chinook salmon, who congregate at rivers' mouths
before their spawning run.</p>
<p>Grown-up fish are served a mile farther at the New Scenic Café, which
serves a mean pistachio-crusted walleye. It's not much to look at, but
it's one of the best restaurants on the North Shore, and its fruit pies
can stand up to any in the state.</p>
<p>Three miles farther, take Stony Point Drive to Stony Point, a grassy
meadow lined with pebble beach. On warm days, it's popular with
boat-watchers, picnickers and fishermen.</p>
<p>On windy days, it's a good place to watch the surf, and when waves
pound the shore in winter, the surfers come out.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/n/knife_river_smelt.jpg" alt="Fishing for smelt in the Knife River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In May, fishermen net smelt on the Knife River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Nearby is a roadside attraction that will be instantly familiar to
anyone who took long car trips in the 1960s. Off the highway, in a
spruce and balsam forest, Tom's Logging Camp shows what life was like
in the logging camps that once dotted the shore.</p>
<p>Visitors can wander among a blacksmith shop, bunkhouse and cook shanty
and see a goofy Paul Bunyan.</p>
<p>But children will most appreciate the petting deer and pygmy goats, as
well as the Old Northwest Co. Trading Post, an old-fashioned repository
of souvenirs.</p>
<p>&quot;We push hard to keep it the kind of tourist attraction that was around
when we were kids,&quot; says owner Lauren Weckman, who took over from her
father. &quot;We try to stay away from anything too modern.&quot;</p>
<p>Knife River is one of the oldest North Shore towns. It was the site of a
logging operation, a commercial-fishing port and, now, the North
Shore's largest marina.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At least two shipwrecks lie offshore — the log-rafting tug Niagara,
sunk in 1904, and the freighter Onoko, sunk in 1915.</p>
<p>Smoked fish still is sold from Russ Kendall's little wooden storefront
along the highway. His family has been in the business ever since his
father's fish truck broke down in Knife River on a 1924 delivery run to
Grand Portage.</p>
<p>The townspeople bought the fish, the father built a fish stand, and now
Kendall dispenses his own smoked slabs of trout, whitefish and salmon,
along with a little advice: &quot;Eat it just like a banana, and watch out
for the bones.&quot;</p>
<p>In &quot;town,&quot; next to the mouth of the Knife River, the Great!Lakes
Candy Kitchen has replaced Mel's Fish House. But the Canelake family
kept Mel's 1950s fish case to display their handmade chocolates and
candies.</p>
<p>Three miles north of Knife River, a Norwegian stabbur appears by the
side of the road. In the Middle Ages, stabburs were used as warehouses
and built top-heavy to keep out rodents.</p>

A candy shop now occupies the building that once housed Mel's Fish
House.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This one, complete with acanthus carving, was built by local silversmith
Brad Nelson as a Scandinavian imports shop. Two miles farther north,
Dale Burton sells decorative ironwork at his Burton Forge and Gallery.</p>
<p>There's a string of small, old-fashioned resorts on the last stretch of
Scenic Old 61, which ends on the outskirts of Two Harbors.</p>
<p>On the third Saturday of June, thousands of runners gather here for the
beginning of Grandma's Marathon, one of the most scenic marathons in
the world.</p>
<p>On that day, Scenic Old 61 is a party, lined with bands and cheering
spectators. But to those with a little extra time to spend, it's a lot
of fun any time.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: North Shore Scenic 61</h3>
<p><em>When to go</em> : In May, fishing reaches fever pitch; the smelt runs when
the streams that empty into Lake Superior reach 45 degrees, around
Mother's Day. On the third Saturday of June, <a href="http://www.grandmasmarathon.com">Grandma's
Marathon</a> is held on Scenic 61.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/north_shore_scenic_61.jpg" alt="Shacks along Minnesota's Scenic 61." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Fishing shacks line Stony Point, best-known for storm-watching and
surfing.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the third Saturday in September, the <a href="http://www.northshoreinline.com/">North Shore Inline
Marathon</a> uses Scenic 61. In winter,
storm-watchers and surfers converge on Stony Point.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : Just four miles from the Lester River, the <a href="http://www.innongitchegumee.com">Inn on
Gitche Gumee</a> has 10 northwoodsy
suites, some with whirlpool and fireplace and four with kitchens, and a
cottage that sleeps up to eight and has a whirlpool and fireplaces.
Weekday rates in winter, from Nov. 1 to Memorial Day weekend, are quite
good.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dodgeslog.com/">Dodge's Log Lodges</a>, on the lake near
Stoney Point, just south of Knife River, has six attractive cabins, all
with fireplaces.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.islandviewresortmn.com/">Island View Resort</a> in Knife River
would be a good place to take young children; it's across the road from
the lake, but sits in a grove of white pines and has a beautiful view
and a large lawn. It has 10 small cabins, all of which accept pets ($15
per day) and a larger, handicapped-accessible cabin.</p>
<p>Just north of Knife River, <a href="http://www.stonegateonsuperior.com/">Stonegate on
Superio</a> r offers eight cabins on
the lake.</p>
