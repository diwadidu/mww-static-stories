<p>In Wisconsin, people build whole trips around the roads less traveled.</p>
<p>Their destination? Nowhere. And on one of the state's lovely Rustic
Roads, nowhere usually is enough.</p>
<p>Across the state, brown-and-yellow signs point to lightly traveled roads
that preserve remnants of the past — the 1870 Cana Island lighthouse
( <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr38.aspx">Rustic Road
38</a>
near <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/baileys-harbor-door-county/"><strong>Baileys
Harbor</strong></a>
), or Amish farms ( <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr56.aspx">Rustic Road
56</a>,
south of <em>Ontario</em> ).</p>
<p>In the north woods near <em>Park Falls</em> , <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr105.aspx">Rustic Road
105</a>
goes through a <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadtrips/covered-bridges-midwest/">covered
bridge</a> — though it's a
replica of one of the classic bridges.</p>
<p>But often, the road is just a pleasant country lane that happens to be
spectacular in the fall or flush with wildflowers in spring.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the fall, <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr1.aspx">Rustic Road
1</a>
near <em>Rib Lake</em> is a gorgeous drive, winding around lakes through the
glacial terrain of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/ice-age-trail/">Ice Age National Scenic
Trail</a>.</p>
<p>Another rolling country road connects it to <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr62.aspx">Rustic Road
62</a>,
which skirts the lake at the feet of <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/timms-hill/"><strong>Timm's
Hill</strong></a>, the state's
highest point. Those who climb the observation tower are literally on
top of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr33.aspx">Rustic Road
33</a>
near <em>Hubertus</em> , motorists have a view of Holy Hill, whose spire they
can climb for an even better view, especially in fall.</p>
<p>The 12-mile <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr60.aspx">Rustic Road
60</a>
is another fall beauty, following a county road from <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/boulder-junction/"><strong>Boulder
Junction</strong></a>
past the lakes of Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest.</p>
<p>In fact, all the roads are lovely in fall; exploring them is a good way
to enjoy the colors without billboards or traffic.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lacrosse_rustic_road.jpg" alt="Rustic Road 26 near La Crosse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
South of La Crosse, Rustic Road 26 climbs a ridge from Mormon Coulee
Creek.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the spring, those who traverse five-mile <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr28.aspx">Rustic Road
28</a>
north of <em>Amery</em> will pass country churches and cemeteries and find
themselves at Apple River County Park, where thick beds of trilliums
crowd out even the dandelions.</p>
<p>South of <em>Maiden Rock</em> , <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr51.aspx">Rustic Road
51</a>
is more rustic than most, with rogue streams often crossing dips in its
narrow, packed-dirt surface. When it ends, those who don't double back
may find themselves lost in the ridges above <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/driving-lake-pepin/">Lake
Pepin</a>.</p>
<p>But in spring, its four miles are lined with an amazing array of
wildflowers.</p>
<p>When I was exploring the stretch one May, Laurie Hilden of nearby
Onalaska was there visiting her father and picking Mother's Day flowers
for her grandmother, who had requested them. She grew up just over the
hill.</p>
<p>&quot;This hasn't changed since I was a kid,&quot; Hilden said. &quot;It's so
unique — it's the kind of place you don't find much anymore.&quot;</p>

<h3>'This place is special'</h3>
<p>Since 1975, motorists have been able to find their way to Wisconsin's
prettiest nooks and crannies, thanks to the Rustic Roads program.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems to be near and dear to the hearts of Wisconsinites,&quot; says
coordinator Jane Carrola.</p>
<p>The roads are nominated by local jurisdictions and receive no special
protection, though one of the criteria is that the road not be slated
for development.</p>
<p>&quot;The Rustic Road designation is good for the first step, in saying,
'This place is special,'&quot; Carrola says.</p>
<p>Posted speed limits shouldn't exceed 45 mph, but slower is better. No
signs point to interesting sights, and the free guide offers only hints.</p>
<p>One fall, I revisited <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr26.aspx">Rustic Road
26</a>
south of <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/cruises-in-lacrosse/"><strong>La Crosse</strong></a> on a Sunday
morning, and I not only crawled along, I frequently stopped and got out.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/trempealeau_seven_bridges_summer.jpg" alt="Seven Bridges Road." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Off Rustic Road 64, McGilvray Road features five rare bowstring-arch
bridges.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's one of the older Rustic Roads, and a few mobile homes and newly
built houses are clustered around the end closest to La Crosse. Then, it
rounded a corner, where the 1854 Oehler Mill sat along Mormon Coulee
Creek, framed by cotton grass.</p>
<p>From there, it become as close to a mountain road as Wisconsin gets,
using switchbacks to climb up to Brinkman's Ridge.</p>
<p>From the top, there was a panorama of the Mississippi River Valley. A
windmill poked over the top of a cornfield, and an enormous white pine
grew incongruously at the end of a farm drive. At another ridgetop farm,
bison grazed.</p>
<p>Of course, there's not much of <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/vernon-county-wisconsin/">southwest Wisconsin coulee
country</a> that
isn't picturesque. South of Ontario and Wildcat Mountain State Park,
<a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr56.aspx">Rustic Road
56</a>
follows another ridgetop past views of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/spring-scenery/kickapoo-valley-wisconsin/"><strong>Kickapoo River
Valley</strong></a>, an 1855 chinked-timber
settler's cabin, a round barn and a series of Amish farms.</p>
<p>On a trip to the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/wisconsin-potosi-platteville/">historic lead-mining
district</a> in the southwest tip of the
state, I drove three, including <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr66.aspx">Rustic Road
66</a>
near <em>Hazel Green</em> , which follows a creek sunk deep into the flat
coulee floor and passes the tunnel of an old rail line from Galena and
an abandoned mine.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/sturgeon_bay_coast_guard.jpg" alt="The Canal Light in Sturgeon Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Rustic Road 77 follows Lake Michigan shoreline from the Coast Guard
station on Sturgeon Bay's ship canal.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Not far to the north, <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr70.aspx">Rustic Road
70</a>
is one of the most atmospheric Rustic Roads, a 10-mile roller coaster
that winds along a ridge and down through a dark, creepy forest canopy;
at the end, there's a church with a witch's-hat steeple and cemetery.</p>
<p>One of the newer routes, <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr99.aspx">Rustic Road
99</a>,
is around <em>Potosi</em> , where visitors are sure to stumble on the St. John
Mine and perhaps the remains of 1830s &quot;badger holes,&quot; or miner's
huts, on the opposite hill.</p>
<h3>Watch for an upcoming attraction</h3>
<p>Often, the Rustic Roads are simply beacons, leading to sights people
wouldn't see otherwise. That's how I ended up climbing Indian Moccasin
Nature Trail to the 35-foot-high sandstone arch of <a href="https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/naturalbridge/"><strong>Natural Bridge
State Park</strong></a> in
Sauk County. <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr21.aspx">Rustic Road
21</a>,
lined with drifts of lavender dame's rocket in early summer, goes right
past it.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/"><strong>Trempealeau</strong></a>, <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr64.aspx">Rustic Road
64</a>
is a rather ordinary road lined with country ramblers. But off it is
McGilvray Road, a footpath that once was a road to a town, now vanished,
on the Black River bottomlands.</p>
<p>Now part of the Van Loon Wildlife Area, the isolated path has an
Amazonian feel, crossing red-tinted streams on five rare bowstring-arch
bridges. It even has its own fan club, the <a href="http://www.7bridgesrd.org/about-mcgilvray-road.html">Friends of McGilvray
Road</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the roads are good for bicycling, though some are gravel.</p>
<p>Near the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/waupaca-lakes/"><strong>Waupaca Chain O'
Lakes</strong></a>, I
bicycled on <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr23.aspx">Rustic Road
23</a>
from <em>Rural</em> , a tiny village that was settled in the 1850s by Scots and
looks transplanted from New England, with white Greek Revival-style
houses set along the Crystal River.</p>
<p>I also bicycled on <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr24.aspx">Rustic Road
24</a>,
which starts from the edge of <em>Rural</em> and winds through a corridor of
red pines and past an 1854 coach house with a yard filled with
flea-market finds, where I stopped to chat with its genial owner.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/a/hartford_rustic33.jpg" alt="Rustic Road 33 near Holy Hill." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Hubertus, Rustic Road 33 gives motorists a view of Holy Hill.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Not far to the north, I took a detour from Mountain Bay State Trail and
bicycled the 14 miles of <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr47.aspx">Rustic Road
47</a>
from <em>Wittenberg.</em></p>
<p>The road was lined with all kinds of interesting things: the stone 1935
Germania Town Hall; errant boulders heaped at the edge of a cedar
forest; an Arts and Crafts high school and three country cemeteries. It
was also a <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/midwest-barn-tours/">route for barn
lovers</a>.</p>
<p>State bicycle trails often intersect Rustic Roads, and with a good map,
bicyclists can ride over and check them out. From the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/great-river-trail/"><strong>Great River
State
Trail</strong></a>
north of <em>Onalaska</em> , County Road XX leads to <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr64.aspx">Rustic Road
64</a>,
from which McGilvray Road starts.</p>
<p>South of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/menomonie-wisconsin-attractions/"><strong>Menomonie</strong></a>, the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/red-cedar-trail-menomonie/">Red Cedar State
Trail</a> parallels
<a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr89.aspx">Rustic Road
89</a>.
South of <em>Danbury</em> , the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/stcroix-falls/">Gandy Dancer State
Trail</a> intersects Rustic <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr79.aspx">Road
79</a>.
And south of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/minocqua-wisconsin-lake-vacation/"><strong>Minocqua</strong></a>, the <a href="https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/bearskin/">Bearskin State
Trail</a> crosses <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr58.aspx">Rustic
Road
58</a>.</p>
<p>And some of the roads are so short they can be walked or jogged, even
round-trip; the minimum length is two miles. In the cranberry country
east of <em>Spooner</em> , for example, 2.2-mile <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr71.aspx">Rustic Road
71</a>
follows the western shore of Stone Lake, under a canopy of trees.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/a/parkfalls_bridge_side.jpg" alt="A covered bridge near Park Falls." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Park Falls, Rustic Road 105 traverses the Smith Rapids covered
bridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Not all the routes are rural. In southeast Wisconsin, which has the
state's densest concentration of Rustic Roads, <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr29.aspx">Rustic Road
29</a>
takes motorists past the famous estates of <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/walking-lake-geneva/"><strong>Lake
Geneva</strong></a>
** .</p>
<p>We'd already seen the mansions up close on the Lake Geneva walking
path, so it was fun to see their backyards, many of which feature
horses, woods and split-rail fences.</p>
<p>From <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/sturgeon-bay/"><strong>Sturgeon
Bay</strong></a>,
<a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr77.aspx">Rustic Road
77</a>
gets travelers off busy Wisconsin 42, for a quiet cruise along the shore
of Lake Michigan from the ship canal and a fog-signal station called Big
Red.</p>
<p>However you travel a Rustic Road, be sure to take your time. The
highways are for rushing; these are for savoring.</p>
