<h2>Beaches, bays and forests are keys to this lovely peninsula.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/door_county_cave_point.jpg" alt="Waves at Cave Point County Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Waves crash at Cave Point County Park near Jacksonport.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Fish boils, cherry pie, chic shops and a nonstop stream of tourists.</p>
<p>Yes, that's Door County, all right. But so is this:</p>
<p>Secluded beaches of fine white sand. Estuaries lined with herons. Hiking
and bicycle trails winding through sun-dappled cedar forests.</p>
<p>Like Minnesota's rugged North Shore, Wisconsin's Door Peninsula was
settled by hardy Scandinavian fishermen and loggers.</p>
<p>This shore, however, is closer to big cities, which have been sending up
vacationing hordes for a century. During the summer, the hubbub can seem
overwhelming.</p>
<p>But there are good reasons so many people come to Door County. The towns
are irresistibly picturesque: Fish Creek, which has so many shops the
streets are perfumed by potpourri.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Ephraim, where the waterfront is lined by old-fashioned white-frame
hotels and steepled churches. Sister Bay, with its pretty waterfront
park and gazebo.</p>
<p>Tourists taper off between Ellison Bay and Gills Rock, at the &quot;tip of
the thumb.&quot;</p>
<p>In Gills Rock, life revolves around Hedgehog Harbor, home of fishing
boats and the ferries that take tourists to Washington Island and from
there to Rock Island.</p>
<p>The northern end of the peninsula is less busy, with quiet forests and
swimming either from placid beaches on the Green Bay side or more
dramatic ones on Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>There are hiking trails in five state parks, and the bicycling is superb</p>
<ul>
<li>on pastoral county roads through the interior, along the lightly
traveled lake side, in Peninsula State Park and on quiet Washington
Island.</li>
</ul>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitefish_dunes.jpg" alt="Whitefish Dunes State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Lake Michigan, Whitefish Dunes State Park has rocky shoreline as
well as sand dunes.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Of course, there's swimming from the many beaches, and boating from the
marinas.</p>
<p>The evenings, too, are made to be spent outdoors - under the stars at
a performance of the Northern Sky Theatre, surrounded by the pines of
Peninsula State Park, or walking through the grounds of the Peninsula
Players, whose murky cedar forest, strung with colored lights, looks
like a set for &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream.&quot;</p>
<p>On the Door Peninsula, there are endless opportunities to revel in the
great outdoors.</p>
<h3>Parks</h3>
<p>In addition to the state parks - Potawatomi, on the headlands of
Sturgeon Bay; Whitefish Dunes, just north of Sturgeon Bay on Lake
Michigan; Peninsula, on Green Bay between Fish Creek and Ephraim;
Newport, Wisconsin's only designated wilderness park; and Rock Island</p>
<ul>
<li>there are gorgeous county parks and state natural areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cave Point County Park, just north of Whitefish Dunes, is the best known
for its craggy, wave-splashed cliffs.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The rustic Door Bluff Headlands County Park, north of Ellison Bay, has a
spectacular view of Hedgehog Harbor over Green Bay.</p>
<p>Ellison Bluff County Park west of Ellison Bay also has a view from the
top of 100-foot limestone bluffs.</p>
<h3>Hiking</h3>
<p>All of the state parks have great trails. On the 3.6-mile Tower Trail in
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/Potawatomi/">Potawatomi State Park</a>, hike along the bay on the first part of the Ice Age National Scenic
Trail.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/whitefish/">Whitefish Dunes</a> has
trails through a variety of landforms; try the 2.4-mile Red Trail. In
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/peninsula/">Peninsula State Park</a>,
the two-mile Eagle Trail follows the bluffs; add the three-mile Skyline
Trail for more views.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/rockisland/">Rock Island State
Park</a>, hike to
Pottawatomie Lighthouse and around the island on the 5.2-mile Thordarson
Loop.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/c/schoolhouse_beach.jpg" alt="Schoolhouse Beach on Washington Island." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Travel Wisconsin</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Washington Island, Schoolhouse Beach is famous for its smooth
limestone.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For solitude and occasional Lake Michigan views, hike the seven-mile
Europe Bay Trail or three-mile Hotz loop in <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/newport/">Newport State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>Near Baileys Harbor, <a href="http://www.ridgessanctuary.org">Ridges Sanctuary</a>
has stunning trails that cross a series of sand ridges and wetland
strips called swales.</p>
<p>In the Mink River Estuary just east of Ellison Bay, Nature Conservancy
trails lead into the estuary from each side. From County Road P/Mink
River Road, watch for a green-and-yellow sign marking a small parking
lot.</p>
<p>From there, it's a beautiful hour-long walk through a corridor of cedar
and along a forest floor turned bright yellow by the fall leaves of
ferns and baby maples.</p>
<p>There are also 28 <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/NaturalAreas/county.html#Door">state natural areas in Door
County</a>,
which are maintained by the parks but have no services besides trails.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/door_county_logan_creek.jpg" alt="A boardwalk in Logan Creek." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A boardwalk winds across a boggy area in Logan Creek natural area.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Near Ridges Sanctuary off Ridges Road in Baileys Harbor, across from the
house with fire number 1981, a short drive leads to the trails of <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=57">Toft
Point Natural
Area</a>,
where the family of environmentalist Emma Toft once ran a fishing camp.</p>
<p>One of the best hikes for a drizzly (or very hot) day is <a href="https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=543">Logan
Creek</a>
south of Jacksonport, where a canopy of cedar, hemlock and balsam fir
protects hikers on two miles of trails. They're beautiful, with long,
winding boardwalks that cross hummocky areas.</p>
<p>These trails are owned by Ridges Sanctuary, which charges a trail fee
that also is good for the preserve itself in Baileys Harbor. From
Jacksonport, take Wisconsin 57 2½ miles south to Loritz Road and go a
quarter mile south. The natural area is on the west side of Clark Lake.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Bicycling</h3>
<p>The Door is made for bicycling. For a short trip, ride the 9½-mile
Sunset Trail through Peninsula State Park.</p>
<p>For a lovely 36-mile sightseeing tour, ride from Ephraim on County Road
Q across the peninsula to Cana Island Lighthouse and Ridges Sanctuary
near Baileys Harbor, then back on County Road F to Fish Creek and
through Peninsula State Park and past Eagle Bluff Lighthouse to Ephraim.</p>
<p>For a 25-mile ride that takes in the best sights of the &quot;tip of the
thumb,&quot; start in Ellison Bay and take Garrett Bay Road to Hedgehog
Harbor, just short of Porte des Morts, or Death's Door.</p>
<p>Cottage Road leads to Gills Rock and joins Wisconsin 42, which ends at
the ferry landing in Northport. From there, Porte des Morts Road leads
to Park Lane, which leads to Weborg Park, a tiny park atop a rocky beach
that's fun to explore.</p>
<p>Heading west, take Park Drive to Timberline Drive and south to Europe
Bay Road.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/rock_island_beach.jpg" alt="The beach at Rock Island State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The east edge of Rock Island is lined with white-sand beaches.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From there, a bicyclist has three options: east to Europe Bay beach,
south on Newport Drive to the east trailhead leading to the Mink River
or west to Wisconsin 42, in which case you'll turn right on Badger Road,
left on Birchwood Road and return to Ellison Bay on Garrett Bay Road.</p>
<h3>Swimming</h3>
<p>It's best in late summer, when Lake Michigan warms up. Try the long,
pine-fringed crescent of Europe Bay at <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/newport/">Newport State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>There are beautiful beaches at <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/rockisland/">Rock Island State
Park</a>, and if you like
to camp, that's the place to be.</p>
<p>There are also nice beaches at the town parks in Egg Harbor, Fish Creek,
Ephraim, Sister Bay and Ellison Bay.</p>
<p>Peninsula State Park has a sand beach on Nicolet Bay with a snack bar,
kayak rentals, playground and volleyball nets.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/i/fish_creek_view.jpg" alt="Peninsula State Park in Door County." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A couple relax on Eagle Bluff in Peninsula State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the Lake Michigan side, Whitefish Dunes has colder water but plenty
of sand and nature trails.</p>
<h3>Kayaking</h3>
<p>One of the best paddling tours is through the <a href="https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=218">Mink River
Estuary</a>, a Nature Conservancy preserve. It's one of the most pristine
freshwater estuaries in the nation, and its marshy shores are lined by
herons and egrets.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dcadventurecenter.com/rowleys.html">Door County Adventure
Center</a> rents kayaks and
offers kayak tours from Rowleys Bay Resort, southeast of Ellison Bay on
the Lake Michigan side.</p>
<p>For paddling on Green Bay, it also rents kayaks in Egg Harbor. In
Ephraim, <a href="http://www.bayshoreoutfitters.com/locations/ephraim-kayak-center/">Bay Shore Outdoors
Store</a>
rents kayaks and offers daily guided kayak tours around the peninsula.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Door County outdoors</h3>
<p><em>When to go</em> : In late May and early June, see the rare wildflowers at
Ridges Sanctuary near Baileys Harbor and at the 28 <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/">state natural
areas</a> in Door County.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/door_county_view.jpg" alt="The view from Eagle Bluff." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Peninsula State Park, there's a panoramic view of Green Bay from
Eagle Tower.

County</a>.</p>
<p>July, the first three weeks of August and October weekends are hectic.
Reserve far in advance.</p>
<p>Hotel rates start to go down in mid-August, and weekdays in September
and October are very pleasant and not too busy.</p>

<p><em>Accommodations</em> : For a list, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/best-motels-resorts-door-county/">Where to stay in Door
County</a>.</p>
<p><em>Camping</em> : <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/newport/">Newport State
Park</a>, Wisconsin's only
wilderness park, has some rustic sites that are walk-in but gorgeous:
Backpack Sites 14 and 16, on Lake Michigan and a stone's throw from
Europe Lake.</p>
<p>For more conventional camping, try <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/peninsula/">Peninsula State
Park</a>, where sites are
the state's most coveted.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baileys_harbor_kayakers.jpg" alt="Kayaking near Baileys Harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Door County Tourism</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A kayaker paddles around Cana Island Lighthouse near Baileys Harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The park is almost like a resort; it includes beaches, bicycle trails, a
professional theater and a golf course, and it's adjacent to shopping
and restaurants in Fish Creek and Ephraim.</p>
<p>The cost of a daily vehicle permit here is higher than in other state
parks: $10 for residents, $13 non-residents. However, you can visit
more than one park with it.</p>
<p>In Sturgeon Bay, <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/Potawatomi/">Potawatomi State
Park</a> on Green Bay also
is a good place to camp.</p>
<p>For more about Sturgeon Bay, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/sturgeon-bay/">The door to Door
County</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/rockisland/">Rock Island State Park</a>
has campsites on lovely beaches, but access requires two ferry
crossings.</p>
<p>For more about Rock Island, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/rock-island-state-park-wisconsin/">Wisconsin's Icelandic
outpost</a>.</p>
<p>As at all Wisconsin state-park sites, sites can be
<a href="https://wisconsin.goingtocamp.com/">reserved</a> up to 11 months in
advance at 888-947-2757.</p>
<p><em>Nightlife</em> : <a href="http://www.northernskytheater.com/">Northern Sky Theater</a>
performs in an amphitheater in Peninsula State Park in summer and at the
indoor Gould Theater.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.peninsulaplayers.com">Peninsula Players</a> perform in a
theater on the shores of Green Bay near Fish Creek.</p>
