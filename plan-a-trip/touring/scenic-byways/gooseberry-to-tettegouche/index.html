<h2>From Gooseberry Falls, a single stretch of highway is packed with Nature's spectacles.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/shovel_point_fall.jpg" alt="Shovel Point from Palisade Head." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
There's a spectacular view of Shovel Point from Palisade Head.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In one 19-mile stretch of Minnesota's North Shore, Nature presents a
one-two-three punch of incomparable beauty.</p>
<p>Just half an hour north of Duluth, Gooseberry Falls State Park presents
an eye-popping spectacle of waterfalls, lumpy beds of ancient lava and
twisted cedar clinging to rock outcroppings.</p>
<p>Six miles farther, Split Rock Lighthouse sits picturesquely on its
cliff, a tourist attraction since 1924, when people could get to it on
the newly completed Minnesota 61.</p>
<p>Few tourists on the North Shore fail to traipse the park's lakeside
trails, at least far enough to get a good photo of the pale-yellow
lighthouse.</p>
<p>And 12 miles past that, the trails of Tettegouche Park showcase rugged
headlands and a series of wild waterfalls, coursing creamy-gold down the
faces of black basalt heaved from the center of the Earth a billion
years ago.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's an embarrassment of natural riches.</p>
<p>Many visitors to the North Shore whiz right by this stretch on their way
to Lutsen or Grand Marais.</p>
<p>But those who don't have much time or don't want to spend it driving
would be smart to stay right here, near some of the North Shore's best
trails and best accommodations.</p>
<p>Gooseberry is the most-visited outstate park in Minnesota, no doubt
because its falls are only yards from the highway and because day
visitors pay no fee to park and walk to the river, along a trail
accessible to wheelchairs. There's a handsome visitor center of wood
and rock, with a gift shop and exhibits.</p>
<p>In the winter, the falls seethe rather than roar, but they are even more
beautiful under translucent curtains of icicles. A 20-kilometer web of
cross-country ski trails covers the park; often, skiers will spot the
tracks of the wolves who also use the trails.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/i/gitchigami2_debra.jpg" alt="Riding the Gitchi-Gami Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Debra Gagner</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Along the highway, bicyclists can ride from Gooseberry Falls to Beaver
Bay and beyond on the paved <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/gitchigami/index.html">Gitchi-Gami State
Trail</a>.</p>
<p>Four miles up the road, the five-mile Split Rock River Loop is one of
the most popular stretches of the Superior Hiking Trail, following and
then crossing the red-rock river gorge.</p>
<p>The 1909 lighthouse is 2½ miles farther, perched atop its 130-foot
cliff. Built in response to the epic 1905 storm that wrecked six ships
within a dozen miles of the Split Rock River, it was decommissioned in
1969.</p>
<p>The beacon always is lighted on Nov. 10, the anniversary of the Edmund
Fitzgerald sinking, when the names of the 29 crewmen are read and an
interpreter discusses the Fitzgerald, which went down off the coast of
Michigan's Upper Peninsula, not far from the Soo Locks.</p>
<p>From May 15 to Oct. 15, the lighthouse, fog-signal building and
keeper's quarters are open for tours. The visitors center, which
includes displays on commercial fishing and tourism and a 22-minute film
on the lighthouse, is open all year.</p>
<p>Across the cove from the lighthouse, the state park includes Gold Rock,
scene of a dramatic shipwreck during the 1905 storm. At its base, the
Madeira is a favorite of scuba divers.</p>
<p>Beaver Bay, the oldest continuously occupied white settlement along the
shore, appears four miles up the highway. This was the home of the
legendary John Beargrease, who carried mail along the shore from 1879 to
1900, via dog sled in winter.</p>
<p>He's buried in the little Ojibwe cemetery on a hill just off County
Road 4; during the annual John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon, the teams
stop to pay tribute.</p>
<p>Beaver Bay has cafes and some interesting shops, the best of which is
the Beaver Bay Agate Shop and Museum, a good place to pick up tips on
agate-picking spots and to see odd rocks.</p>
<p>At the edge of town, rock-pickers gather at the mouth of the Beaver
River, one of the best places to find agates.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/split_rock_fall.jpg" alt="Split Rock Lighthouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Split Rock Lighthouse has been a tourist draw since it was built in
1910.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Silver Bay is three miles away, home of a giant taconite-processing
plant and the roly-poly mascot Rocky Taconite. Two miles beyond that, a
narrow road winds up to Palisade Head, a sheer clifftop that provides
picnickers with sweeping views of Lake Superior shoreline.</p>
<p>Tettegouche State Park is just 2½ miles farther. Its 70-foot High Falls
on the Baptism River is the highest in Minnesota if you don't count the
120-foot High Falls of the Pigeon River, whose cascade along the
Minnesota border is shared with Ontario.</p>
<p>The 17 miles of hiking and cross-country ski trails wind through the
park to four lakes, including Mic Mac, where the park rents four
restored 1910 cabins. The most popular trails lead to Shovel Point, a
dramatically rocky palisade on the lake, and upstream to Two Step Falls
and, across a suspension bridge, High Falls.</p>
<p>And just up Minnesota 1 from Tettegouche, near Finland, the campus of
Wolf Ridge Environmental Learning Center includes a river, two gentle
mountains and two lakes, on which guests can paddle voyageur canoes.</p>
<p>The center also has a treetops ropes course and a rock-climbing wall,
and provides outdoors sports according to season — skiing, mushing,
snowshoeing, hiking.</p>
<p>On the near North Shore, there's a trail for everyone.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: The near North Shore</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : Gooseberry Falls is 39½ miles from Duluth's Canal
Park. From Gooseberry, it's 19 miles to Tettegouche State Park.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-minnesota/trip-planning-north-shore-minnesota/">North Shore by the
mile</a>.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations:</em> <a href="http://www.castlehaven.net/">Castle Haven Cabins</a>,
12 miles east of Two Harbors, has 12 two-bedroom cabins right on the
lake, and seven have wood-burning fireplaces.</p>
<p>Nearby, <a href="http://www.grandsuperior.com">Grand Superior Lodge</a> includes
newer log-style cabins and townhomes next to the lake. There's also a
restaurant and pool area.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gooseberry.com/">Gooseberry Trailside Suites</a>, in the woods
on the east side of Gooseberry Falls State Park, has four attractive
two-bedroom suites, each with wood-burning fireplace and full kitchen.
There's a sauna and a ski-waxing room outside.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/split_rock_keepers.jpg" alt="The keepers' houses at Split Rock Lighthouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Next to Split Rock Lighthouse, the keepers' houses overlook Lake
Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Split Rock Cabins has 10 nice housekeeping cabins on flat, grassy Lake
Superior shoreline. It's a half-mile west of the Split Rock River,
218-226-4735.</p>
<p>On the west edge of Beaver Bay, <a href="http://www.covepointlodge.com/">Cove Point
Lodge</a> sits next to the lake on a pretty
cove. It has a restaurant and pool area and also rents cottages.</p>
<p>The Americinn in Silver Bay may be a good place to take kids; it has a
110-foot spiral water slide and rates include breakfast with waffle bar.
218-226-4300.</p>
<p>Tettegouche State Park has two highly prized places to stay. The
luxurious Illgen Falls Cabin is atop 45-foot Illgen Falls on the Baptism
River, off Minnesota 1.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/state-park-cabins/">Cabin on a
waterfall</a>.</p>
<p>On the other side of the park, accessible only by a 1¾-mile gravel road
over which guests must tote all their supplies, are the four rustic
cabins on Mic Mac Lake.</p>

<p><em>Camping</em> : <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/split_rock_lighthouse/index.html">Split
Rock</a>, which doesn't have very many sites, is the hardest-to-get reservation
in the state. Sites are cart-in or backpack only.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/tettegouche/index.html">Tettegouche</a>, which also has a cart-in campground, and <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/gooseberry_falls/index.html">Gooseberry
Falls</a>
also are in the Top 10 most popular Minnesota camping parks.</p>
<p>Campsites at the inland <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/george_crosby_manitou/index.html">Crosby Manitou State
Park,</a>
east of Finland off Minnesota 1, are easiest to get. Campsites can be
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/reservations_campsite.html">reserved</a>
a year in advance.</p>
<p><em>Dining</em> : In Castle Danger, the <a href="http://www.rusticinncafe.com">Rustic
Inn</a> is a pleasant place to eat,
especially for breakfast or pie.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mnhs.org/splitrock"><strong>Split Rock Lighthouse</strong></a> : The
lighthouse is operated by the Minnesota Historical Society. It's open
for tours May 15 through Oct. 16 and the following weekend for the
Minnesota school break.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/split_rock.jpg" alt="The split rocks on the Split Rock loop." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A hiker climbs on split rocks along the Split Rock River hiking loop.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On Nov. 10, it holds a commemoration of the Edmund Fitzgerald (see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/north-shore-shipwrecks/">Gales of November</a>
). In winter, the visitors center is open Thursdays through Mondays; no
fee is charged, but you need a state-park vehicle permit.</p>
<p>Admission is $8. It's free during the annual state-parks open house in
early June and free for children on Children's Day.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wolf-ridge.org/">Wolf Ridge Environmental Learning Center</a> :
This beautiful campus in the hills above the North Shore, up Minnesota 1
near the village of Finland, has nearly 2,000 wooded acres that include
two lakes, two rivers and 18 miles of trails.</p>
<p>It has two indoor climbing walls, two high-ropes courses, three
orienteering courses, a ski chalet and a swimming beach.</p>
<p>It offers a weeklong family vacation in summer, family canoe trips,
Split Rock kayak tours, a fall hiking weekend and a Presidents Day
skiing, snowshoeing and dog-sledding weekend.</p>
<p>It also offers two-hour <a href="https://wolf-ridge.org/visit/split-rock-kayak-tours/">kayak
tours</a> around
Split Rock Lighthouse, $75.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/e/tettegouche_fall_mad.jpg" alt="High Falls in Tettegouche State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Madeleine Ringham</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Tettegouche State Park, High Falls is a hikers' destination.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Hiking</em> : The Split Rock River loop starts four miles north of
Gooseberry Falls, at the mouth of the Split Rock River; there's a
parking area. It's five miles up the west side of the red-rock gorge and
back down the other side.</p>
<p>In Tettegouche State Park, a trail follows the Baptism River upriver and
merges with the Superior Hiking Trail. At High Falls, the tallest
waterfall completely within the state, it crosses a suspension bridge,
heads back and crosses again at Two Steps Falls.</p>
<p>And don't miss the half-mile trail to Shovel Point, where basalt
headlands form a coastline that looks more like northern California than
Minnesota. The view, which includes Palisade Head to the south, is
incomparable.</p>

<p><em>Bicycling</em> : The <a href="http://www.ggta.org/">Gitchi-Gami State Trail</a>
follows the highway on a 13-mile segment from Gooseberry Falls State
Park to Beaver Bay.</p>
<p>For tips on combining the Gitchi-Gami with hikes on the Superior Hiking
Trail, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/north-shore-biking/">Walk 'n'
