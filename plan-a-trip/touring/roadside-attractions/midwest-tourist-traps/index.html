<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/wisconsin_dells_tourist_trap.jpg" alt="Downtown Wisconsin Dells." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Downtown Wisconsin Dells is a honky-tonk mix of carnival-style tourist
attractions and souvenir shops.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Americans have a love-hate relationship with their tourist traps.
They're so uncool . . . but so irresistible.</p>
<p>What makes something a tourist trap? It's a place that's so cheesy you
have to see if it's really as cheesy as it looks. A place so iconic
you've seen a million pictures of it. A place plugged by thousands of
highway billboards.</p>
<p>Mostly, it's a place everyone else has seen — so you have to, too. We
can't help ourselves, especially when it comes to anything that's odd or
oversized.</p>
<p>And why not? Few tourist traps have no redeeming qualities at all, and
most actually are pretty cool — or so you'll think afterward, once the
headache fades (I'm talking about you, House on the Rock).</p>
<p>Here are 10 tourists traps that might make you roll your eyes but still
are worth a visit.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Wisconsin Dells</h3>
<p>So you're standing under the tail of the plane sticking out of Ripley's
Believe It or Not, staring at the billboards all around you: Gentlemen's
Club. Torture Museum. Dells Bells Wedding Chapel.</p>
<p>Las Vegas? No, this is the town that TripAdvisor just named Best
Destination in the U.S. for Families.</p>
<p>Families that don't mind constant over-stimulation, apparently.
There's also a 60-foot Trojan horse, an upside-down White House, a
Castle of Terror and, of course, a lot of roller coasters and water
slides.</p>
<p>Roadside America, the bible of tourist traps, calls it &quot;one of
America's most over-the-top tourism meccas,&quot; and it certainly is.</p>
<p><em>Why you have to go</em> : Your kids will make you.</p>
<p><em>What if you don't want to?</em> Skip the Vegas-like strip and concentrate
on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/quiet-wisconsin-dells/">quiet side of the
Dells</a>,
preferably after Labor Day and before Memorial Day. Along the river, the
Dells are just as beautiful as they were when photographer <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/bennett-studio-wisconsin-dells/">H.H.
Bennett</a> made
them famous.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_green_house_rock_clown.jpg" alt="Creepy clowns at House on the Rock." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
You may feel eyes following you around House on the Rock.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="https://www.thehouseontherock.com/HOTR_AttractionMain.htm">House on the Rock</a></h3>
<p>Perched on a limestone spire overlooking the Wisconsin River Valley and
Frank Lloyd Wright's beloved Taliesen, this rambling complex near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/spring-green/">Spring Green</a> is
full of stuff, some museum-quality and some flea market-quality.</p>
<p>House on the Rock is like a train wreck — looking won't make you feel
good, but it's impossible to turn away. If you want to see everything,
it's a 2½-mile walk from the original &quot;Japanese house&quot; and Infinity
Room to the Doll Carousel Room, and you'll be accompanied the whole way
by tinny music from dozens of vaguely sinister mechanical orchestras.</p>
<p>You'll be exhausted, but you'll also be amazed. And you'll be asking
one question: Why?</p>
<p><em>Why you have to go</em> : 1) Because dozens of highway signs say you do. 2)
Once you've seen it, you don't have to go again.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3><a href="http://www.navypier.com">Navy Pier</a></h3>
<p>Millennium Park may be tourists' favorite milling-around spot now, but
Navy Pier became Chicago's No. 1 tourist attraction after it was
reopened in 1995, and it keeps adding ingenious new ways to separate
tourists from their cash.</p>
<p>Outside, there's a Ferris wheel, musical carousel, wave swinger and
various thrill rides.</p>
<p>Much of the inside is lined with souvenir shops and snack stands. Don't
go there, if you have
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/chicago-with-kids/">children</a> who
beg.</p>
<p><em>Why you have to go</em> : There's a lot of free stuff to see and hear, too</p>
<ul>
<li>pirate shows by the resident Navy Pier Buccaneers, marching bands,
beer-garden concerts, a stained-glass museum, Wednesday and Saturday
fireworks. Just keep a good grip on your wallet.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-mall-america/">Mall of America</a></h3>
<p>There's literally no bigger tourist trap than this vast mall in the
Minneapolis suburb of Bloomington, with 4.2 million square feet of
stores, restaurants and attractions.</p>
<p>It's the No. 1 tourism attraction in Minnesota — those 10,000 lakes
aren't even in the running.</p>
<p>The attractions include Nickelodeon Universe, the nation's largest
indoor family theme park — you <em>do</em>
love SpongeBob SquarePants, don't you? — which offers more than 30
rides, including the Dutchman's Deck adventure high-ropes course.</p>
<p>There's also the 1.2 million-gallon Sea Life Minnesota aquarium,
FlyOver America flight simulation ride and an 18-hole miniature golf
course.</p>
<p>And then there's that other attraction — no tax on clothing.</p>
<p><em>Why you have to go</em> : Because everyone back home will think there's
something wrong with you if you don't.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadside-attractions/paul-bunyan-minnesota/">Paul Bunyan</a></h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/bemidji_bunyan_babe2.jpg" alt="Bemidji's famous Paul Bunyan and Babe." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Paul and Babe await tourists on Bemidji's lakefront.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Minnesota, no one leaves
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/bemidji-bunyan-minnesota/">Bemidji</a>
without getting a picture taken with Paul Bunyan.</p>
<p>This 18-foot, plaid-shirted lumberjack began the mania for oversized
town mascots when local Rotarians built him to attract people to the
town's Winter Carnival in 1937.</p>
<p>Paul and his blue ox Babe were a hit, landing on the pages of Life
magazine and the New York Times. In 1938, Bemidji's Winter Carnival
drew 100,000 people to the town of 7,200, and now Paul and Babe are
considered the height of Americana, appearing in coffee-table books the
world over.</p>
<p>There's also a giant Paul in nearly Akeley, his hand extended so kids
can climb on. Seven miles east of Brainerd, a 27-foot Paul Bunyan at
Bunyanland theme park can talk. And Paul Bunyan's wife, a buxom
17-footer, lives in Hackensack.</p>
<p><em>Why you have to go</em> : You haven't really been to Minnesota unless
you've snapped a picture of a giant Bunyan. (In a pinch, though, snap
one of the many other <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadside-attractions/giant-mascots/">giants</a> in the region.)</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.freshwater-fishing.org/">Freshwater Fishing Hall of Fame and Museum</a></h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/a/hayward_big_fish.jpg" alt="Big muskie in Hayward." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The mouth of Hayward's giant muskie is a favorite spot for weddings.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This complex in the northern Wisconsin town of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/indulgent-retreats/hayward-wisconsin-shops-inns/">Hayward</a>
includes 300 mounted fish, 1,000 antique motors and 50,000 lures, rods,
reels and accessories.</p>
<p>But what reels in the tourists is the 4½-story concrete and fiberglass
muskellunge, the local trophy fish. It's half a city block long, and
its jaws are big enough for 20 people or, occasionally, a wedding
party.</p>
<p><em>Why you have to go</em> : There are a lot of fiberglass fish in the north
woods, but this is the biggest.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.niagaracave.com/">Niagara Cave</a></h3>
<p>Did you think you'd checked Paul Bunyan off your list? Not so fast.
This cave near the Minnesota town of Harmony, one of several near the
Iowa border, includes a ledge that guides long called Paul Bunyan's
bed.</p>
<p>Tours indulge in less kitsch these days, but guides still point out an
Elephant's Head, a three-tier Wedding Cake and the Battleship.</p>
<p>Every cave is as sensational as your imagination — so bring yours
stoked to see the most. There's also a 60-foot waterfall, a Cathedral
Dome formed by a whirlpool and a 625-foot Grand Canyon Room, not to
mention thickets of stalactites.</p>
<p><em>Why you have to go</em> : It's cool, all right — 48 degrees year-round.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.cornpalace.org/">Corn Palace</a></h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mitchell_corn_palace.jpg" alt="The Corn Palace." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Every year, there's a new tableau on the Corn Palace in Mitchell, S.D.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you like to look at the seed art at the Minnesota State Fair, you'll
love the facade of this 1921 Moorish exposition hall in Mitchell, S.D.</p>
<p>Every year, local grain, grasses and 13 shades of corn are arranged in a
mural illustrating a theme.</p>
<p>There are free guided tours, with guides sharing &quot;a-maize-ing&quot; facts
about how the murals are created. Stay for a rodeo, car show, tractor
pull or polka festival inside.</p>
<p><em>Why you have to go</em> : The drive to the Black Hills would be really
boring if you didn't.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/best-sights-mackinac-island/">Mackinac Island</a></h3>
<p>This island in the straits between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron is more
fudgy than cheesy. As soon as tourists step off the boat, they're
assailed by aromas from a dozen fudge shops as well as aromas from
something else that's brown and gooey — manure from the hundreds of
horses who pull tourists around in wagons and carriages.</p>
<p>If you don't venture beyond the congested harbor area of this car-free
island, you'll think it's nothing but overpriced fudge and T-shirt and
bike-rental shops.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinac_tourist_trap.jpg" alt="Downtown Mackinac Island." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Fudge and bike-rental shops dominate the main street of Mackinac Island.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>So skip the fudge, rent the bikes and ditch downtown as fast as you can.
The island is encircled by a paved, eight-mile bicycle trail, and the
wooded interior, which rises like the back of a turtle, is crisscrossed
by more trails.</p>
<p><em>Why you have to go</em> : It's the classiest kind of tourist trap (just
watch where you step).</p>
<h3><a href="http://dayoopers.com/thetrap3.html">Da Yoopers Tourist Trap &amp; Museum</a></h3>
<p>Tourists with even an ounce of curiosity become tourist-trap roadkill at
this roadside attraction in Ishpeming, on Michigan's Upper Peninsula.</p>
<p>Who can resist Big Gus, a 23-foot blue chainsaw (world's largest) that
really runs, or Big Ernie, a working rifle (world's largest) mounted on
the bed of an antique pickup truck?</p>
<p>Inside the museum, see a 10-foot mosquito and a patented Sno-Cicle, a
snow machine with wheels &quot;for the one month we ain't got no snow.&quot;</p>
<p>In the tourist trap, you can buy packages of Roadkill Helper and a
T-shirt showing a Yooper seven-course meal — a pasty and a six-pack.</p>
<p><em>Why you have to go</em> : Who doesn't love a good Yooper joke?</p>
