<p>In Wisconsin, nonconformity is cast in concrete.</p>
<p>In the middle of the last century, a motley collection of ordinary folk
— a dairy farmer, a car dealer, a tavern owner, a factory worker —
took a sharp turn away from the ordinary.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, they began to fashion fairy-tale characters, castles,
temples and historical figures out of concrete, adorning them with bits
of glass, crockery, porcelain and seashells and toiling until their
yards overflowed with figures.</p>
<p>Why? Because they felt like it. Long before the New Age dawned, they had
learned to follow their bliss.</p>
<p>The fruits of their labor can be found from the shores of Lake Michigan
to the Mississippi River, along highways, in the wooded yard of a summer
cottage and at the John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Today, thousands of people come from all over the world to marvel at the
artists' originality. They weren't prodigies or geniuses, but what
these self-taught artists lacked in polish, they made up for in sheer
exuberance.</p>
<p>&quot;I just love the passion,&quot; says Terri Yoho, executive director of the
Kohler Foundation, which restored the sites. &quot;When someone does
something just because they want to, and they don't care about anybody
else, or money, it's so real and pure.&quot;</p>
<p>For many, creating art was an antidote to tedium.</p>
<p>Herman Rusch, a retired farmer who created Prairie Moon along the
Mississippi, called it &quot;a good way to kill old-age boredom.&quot;</p>
<p>Dairy farmer Nick Engelbert, who created Grandview in the hills of
southwest Wisconsin, and furniture painter James Tellen, who filled the
yard of his cottage near Lake Michigan, both started creating figures
after they had been waylaid by illness.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/sparta_wegner_ship.jpg" alt="Roadside Distractions." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

tribute to the Bremen ocean liner.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>And it was a way to pay tribute to people and things close to their
hearts.</p>
<p>In the countryside near Sparta, Wis., car dealer Paul Wegner had retired
and didn't want to hunt or fish. So, inspired by a visit to the
Dickeyville Grotto in the state's southwest tip, he and wife Matilda
came home and built a glass church.</p>
<p>Then, they fashioned an American flag, a replica of their
50th-anniversary cake, a big white heart, a star and the Bremen ocean
liner, which reminded them of the one on which they had emigrated from
Germany.</p>
<p>After Paul died in 1937, Matilda kept working on the <a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/preserved-sites/wegner-grotto/">Wegner
Grotto</a>.</p>
<p>In the north woods, former lumberjack and tavern owner Fred Smith
started building figures of people he liked or admired — he filled the
yard of his tavern with 203 figures, which he called the Wisconsin
Concrete Park.</p>
<p>His neighbors in Phillips, Wis., thought he was a crackpot, but the
flamboyant Smith didn't care: &quot;I've been having a good time all my
life!&quot; he said, even after a 1964 stroke forced him into a rest home.</p>
<p>The work was good for their souls — and today, it's good for ours.</p>

<h3>True originals</h3>
<p>In a mass-produced world, their idiosyncratic visions are like a breath
of fresh air. I visit them whenever I can.</p>
<p>Driving along the Mississippi on Wisconsin 35, I always stop at <a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/preserved-sites/prairie-moon-sculpture-garden-and-museum/">Prairie
Moon Sculpture Garden and
Museum</a>, where Rusch installed a Hindu temple, a crenellated stone watchtower
and three dozen other concrete sculptures, including a colorful arched
fence with conical tips painted gold.</p>
<p>Driving between my favorite towns in southwest Wisconsin, Mineral Point
and New Glarus, I stop at
<a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/preserved-sites/grandview/">Grandview</a>, where whimsical figures populate the rolling yard of Nick Engelbert.</p>
<p>There's an organ grinder, a Viking in a boat, Snow White and the Seven
Dwarves, a Hapsburg castle, King Neptune and the Family Tree that
depicts his own four children as monkeys.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/sheboygan_tellen_temple.jpg" alt="A temple is part of the Tellen Woodland Sculpture Garden." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Garden.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>One of the newer sites preserved by the Kohler Foundation is the <a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/preserved-sites/tellen-woodland-sculpture-garden/">Tellen
Woodland Sculpture
Garden</a>, in a quiet neighborhood on the outskirts of Sheboygan.</p>
<p>James Tellen worked in a furniture factory, painting decorative details.
In 1942, in a hospital recovering from an illness, he was inspired by
the concrete sculptures he could see in the churchyard across the
street.</p>
<p>For the remaining 15 years of his life, he created concrete figures for
the yard of his log summer cottage, often displaying the sly humor seen
at Grandview.</p>
<p>Unlike Smith, Tellen had the encouragement of his friends and family,
and his 1957 obituary in the Sheboygan Press called his sculpture
environment &quot;one of the finest exhibits of outdoor art in the state.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He stands away from the others,&quot; Yoho says. &quot;He was a businessman,
more mainstream than some of the other artists. And he was very well
read, with a lot of respect for history and his religion.&quot;</p>

<h3>Rescue missions</h3>
<p>For three decades, the Kohler Foundation in nearby Kohler has
painstakingly preserved such works; since the artists created them for
themselves, not posterity, most had fallen into nearly irreparable
states of decay.</p>
<p>Now, it's begun to rescue sites outside Wisconsin, such as one in
Chauvin, La., where an enigmatic man named Kenny Hill left more than 100
concrete sculptures along a bayou.</p>
<p>&quot;That was magical, and nobody knew about it, not even in the town where
he did it,&quot; said the late Ruth DeYoung Kohler, who was the longtime
president of the Kohler Foundation and director of the John Michael
Kohler Arts Center, which occupies her grandfather's former home in
Sheboygan.</p>
<p>&quot;They needed someone to say, 'This is important.' Fred Smith was the
first, and when we first went up to talk to him, his family was talking
about razing the place.&quot;</p>
<p>Smith's will specified if the figures weren't moved, they belonged to
the tavern, which had been sold. When they went to Phillips to move the
heavy figures, Kohler said, the tavern owner put up mounds of dirt to
block the DNR front-end loader and gave away free beer so customers'
cars would clog the parking lot.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/i/dickeyville_grotto.jpg" alt="Rocks and shells adorn the Dickeyville Grotto." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Dickeyville Grotto.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But Kohler and her crew succeeded in moving the figures across the lot
line, where they were restored and remain today.</p>
<p>&quot;Even that first day, people began to think about them differently,&quot;
she said. &quot;Some even stayed to help us. There was a change in the mind
set.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, the <a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/preserved-sites/wisconsin-concrete-park/">Wisconsin Concrete
Park</a>
is world-renowned, drawing thousands of visitors yearly.</p>
<p>Even though the Kohler Foundation's goal is to allow local people to
take over after restoration is complete, Yoho says it never loses
contact.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like a child who goes off and gets married and has a life of its
own,&quot; she says. &quot;That doesn't mean you forget about them.&quot;</p>
<p>The Kohler Foundation continues to go to great lengths to preserve great
examples of outsider art, which is what curators call it. Another
project had to be retrieved from a Minnesota antiques dealer and the
various people to whom he had sold or consigned the life work of Carl
Peterson.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>A blacksmith and cabinetmaker, Peterson also was a self-taught artist.
Between the turn of the century and 1937, he created an Environmental
Sculpture Garden of Nature in the southwest Minnesota farm town of St.
James.</p>
<p>&quot;We got a call from a friend at the Art Institute in Chicago, who said,
'There's some really cool stuff going up for auction in Maine Tuesday, I
think you'd like it,' &quot; Yoho said.</p>
<p>&quot;So we bought all the pieces available, and then we tracked down the
consigner, and he had some of the rest, including a 45-foot flagpole, a
birdbath and eight or 10 miniature concrete castles.</p>
<p>&quot;Then we sent an intern to St. James to look around, and we paid some
people to let us excavate, and we found some old rubble and pieces. We
started putting things together, and suddenly the castles are fitting
together like a village. So what had been the size of a doghouse
suddenly became much bigger, with unbelievably constructed pieces. It
was done with such incredible care; it's mesmerizing.&quot;</p>
<p>The center has more than 50 pieces, and 15 of the large-scale works are
displayed in its gardens.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel bad that we had to take them out of state; we feel really
bad,&quot; Yoho said. &quot;But we feel really good that we're able to preserve
them. Everyone here has become very attached to them.&quot;</p>
