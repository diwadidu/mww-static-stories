<h2>Here's another round-up for everyone who loves the odd and offbeat.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distractions_30.jpg" alt="Roadside Distraction No. 36." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Lucette Diana Kensack in Hackensack, Minn.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At MidwestWeekends, we love anything that makes us veer off the highway
and say, &quot;Wow, what the heck is that?&quot;</p>
<p>We call these things Roadside Distractions, and we always take a photo.</p>
<p>One of our favorites: Lucette Diana Kensack in Hackensack, Minn.,
halfway between Brainerd and Bemidji.</p>
<p>The first 17-foot Lucette was created in 1952 by a grocer in this small
town and dubbed &quot;Paul Bunyan's sweetheart.&quot;</p>
<p>But a storm lopped off her head and damaged her back and hands, and she
was replaced by this beaming, newly buxom Lucette.</p>
<p>For a while, a waving, midget-sized Paul Jr. stood beside her,
problematic for some since Lucette still was only a sweetheart.</p>
<p>That is, until little Paul became legitimate with the &quot;discovery&quot; of a
marriage license in 2001.</p>
<p>The Associated Press covered the story, calls poured in from around the
nation, and the town sent out 500 parchment copies at $2 apiece and
organized a Lucette &amp; Paul Wedding Anniversary Weekend.</p>
<p>Lucette stands on the shores of Birch Lake, along the Paul Bunyan State
Trail.</p>

The hobo in Starbuck.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Hobo in Starbuck</h3>
<p>The 8-foot hobo of Starbuck is on Lake Minnewaska in west-central
Minnesota.</p>
<p>During the Depression, hundreds of out-of-work men rode the rails into
Starbuck, where they looked for work or food and, at night, gathered in
a wooded area along the shores of the lake.</p>
<p>Many townspeople befriended the men, and the gathering spot became known
as Hobo Park.</p>
<p>Starbuck also is known for baking a 70-foot piece of lefse, the
Scandinavian flatbread, setting the world's record.</p>
<p>A good time to visit this summer would be August, when Starbuck holds a
<a href="http://www.starbuckdragonboat.com/">Dragon Boat Festival</a> on the lake,
and late July, when Glenwood holds its
<a href="http://www.waterama.org/">Waterama</a> festival on the other end of the
lake.</p>
<p>The town of Alexandria is 25 miles to the north, where you can see
another very large traveling man: Big Ole the Viking.</p>

enigma</a>.</p>
<h3>Welcome to Stoughton</h3>
<p>The first things most visitors see is this &quot;Velkommen til Stoughton&quot;
(Welcome to Stoughton) mural in this southern Wisconsin town.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distraction_25.jpg" alt="Roadside Distraction No. 34." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Velkommen til Stoughton mural.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Stoughton, 20 miles south of Madison, has been devoutly Norwegian since
early immigrants made it a tobacco-growing and wagon-manufacturing
center.</p>
<p>It calls its annual Syttende Mai celebration the largest outside Norway,
and it might be the largest anywhere.</p>
<p>Its first Syttende Mai ball was held in 1868, and its celebrations have
been tourist attractions since the turn of the century.</p>
<p>The mural is on a building along the Yahara River. The twirling young
folks are the town's famed Norwegian Dancers.</p>

The snow gauge on the Keweenaw Peninsula.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Snow gauge on the Keweenaw</h3>
<p>The 32-foot snow gauge on Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula is along U.S.
41 between Mohawk and Phoenix.</p>
<p>This is Big Snow country, with an average snowfall of 187 inches. The
record high, 390.4 inches, was set in the winter of 1978-79, and the low
of 81.3 was set in 1930-31.</p>

<h3>The black duck of Blackduck</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distraction_55.jpg" alt="Roadside Distraction No. 32." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The black duck of Blackduck.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The black duck is in Blackduck, a small town that's northeast of
Bemidji in northern Minnesota.</p>
<p>It's about as northwoods as you can get, next to Blackduck State Forest
and on the edge of Chippewa National Forest.</p>
<p>This 1985 fiberglass duck is one of several in the town, where hunting
and fishing are favorite pastimes.</p>
<p>The original black duck was made in 1938, the year after Bemidji's
giant Paul Bunyan first made a splash. That year, it rode on a float in
Bemidji's Winter Carnival with Paul Bunyan's rifle, which actually
fired.</p>
<p>The 16-foot duck also spent a week in a Dayton's display window in St.
Paul, where it appeared in the Winter Carnival there.</p>

Hiawatha in Ironwood, Mich.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Hiawatha in Ironwood</h3>
<p>The 52-foot giant
<a href="https://www.ironwoodchamber.org/business/hiawatha-statue/">Hiawatha</a>
is
in Ironwood on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, just over the Wisconsin
border.</p>
<p>Built in 1964 and named for theÂ  noble brave of Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow's 1855 poem &quot;Song of Hiawatha,&quot; this imposing fellow
wears a feathered headdress and fringed buckskin leggings and cradles a
peace pipe.</p>
<p>Ironwood calls it &quot;the world's tallest and largest Indian.&quot;</p>
<p>From U.S. 2 in Ironwood, turn left onto Douglas Boulevard, or Business
2. At the T, turn right onto Frederick Street, then take an immediate
left onto Suffolk Street.</p>

The voyageur in Cloquet, Minn.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>The voyageur of Cloquet</h3>
<p>This voyageur is in Cloquet, Minn., near Duluth.</p>
<p>French-Canadian voyageurs were the workhorses of the fur trade, paddling
giant canoes laden with trade goods from the St. Lawrence Seaway to the
interior of the content, returning with bales of beaver pelts.</p>
<p>This one stands along the St. Louis River, the largest Lake Superior
tributary in the United States. With Ontario's Nipigon River, it
contributes about one-fourth of the lake's annual water input.</p>
<p>More importantly, it connects Lake Superior to the Mississippi, via the
little Savanna River. From what is now the Duluth harbor, voyageurs
paddled up the St. Louis to John Jacob Astor's fur post next to the
Ojibwe village of Fond du Lac.</p>
<p>To get to present-day Cloquet, they had to portage around the hellacious
rapids in what is now Jay Cooke State Park.</p>
<p>The 20-foot Cloquet voyageur is made of fiberglass, though it looks like
wood. It's just north of downtown in Dunlap Island Park, just off
Minnesota 33.</p>
<p>For more about voyageurs, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/fur-trade/">Scenes from the fur
trade</a>.</p>

The first mural of many in Ashland, Wis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Asaph in Ashland</h3>
<p>Ashland, Wis., is the location of this mural, one of many that celebrate
the history of this town on Lake Superior's Chequamegon Bay.</p>
<p>The trompe l'oeil painting, on a brick building at the junction of U.S.
2 and Wisconsin 13, features <a href="http://www.visitashland.com/murals/mural-1/">Asaph
Whittlesey</a>, who founded
Ashland in 1854.</p>
<p>In 1860, Whittlesey was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly. To get
to the state Capitol in Madison, he had to travel 235 miles by snowshoe
to Sparta, where he could catch a train.</p>
<p>The mural is based on a famous photograph of him taken during his
journey. It wraps around the corner of the building and features six
other prominent residents.</p>
<p>Kelly Meredith and Sue Martinsen created the mural, which became so
popular that locals asked for more. Now, more murals pay tribute to
lighthouse keepers, veterans, lumberjacks, pilots, waitresses, jazz
musicians and shop clerks, all based on real people and photos.</p>
<p>One of the murals shows Ashland's 1916 concrete <a href="http://www.visitashland.com/murals/mural-4/">ore
dock</a>, the world's
largest and the source of the high-school team name, Oredockers. The
eight-story dock has since been torn down by its owner, the Canadian
National Railway.</p>

bay</a>.</p>
<h3>The Woodruff penny</h3>
<p>Woodruff, Wis., is the home of the World's Largest Penny.</p>
<p>The penny commemorates a fundraiser that went viral long before the
Internet. In 1953, a country doctor known as &quot;the Angel on
Snowshoes&quot; wanted a hospital for the people of Woodruff.</p>
<p>A local geometry teacher was looking for a way to teach his students the
concept of a million. A child said, &quot;How about a million pennies?&quot;</p>
<p>They flooded in from around the world, and Dr. Kate Newcomb got her
hospital.</p>
<p>Woodruff adjoins the popular resort town of Minocqua. For more about the
area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/minocqua-winter/">Minocqua's white
magic</a>

<h3>Honest Abe in Sheboygan</h3>
<p>Honest Abe lives at the <a href="http://www.jmkac.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=151&amp;Itemid=134">James Tellen Woodland Sculpture
Garden</a>
outside Sheboygan, Wis.</p>
<p>Tellen's depiction of a young Abraham Lincoln splitting a log is just
one of many quirky concrete sculptures in a wooded yard between town and
Kohler-Andrae State Park.</p>
<p>James Tellen worked in a furniture factory in Sheboygan, painting
decorative details. In 1942, in a hospital recovering from an illness,
he was inspired by the concrete sculptures he could see in the
churchyard across the street.</p>
<p>For the remaining 15 years of his life, he created concrete figures for
the yard of his log summer cottage. Many displayed a sly sense of humor.
Some depicted pioneer scenes; others reflected his Christian faith.</p>
<p>The sculpture garden is in a quiet neighborhood just south of Sheboygan.
From Wisconsin 28, turn east on County Road EE, then go south on
Evergreen Drive about 1 mile, just past Indian Mound Road.</p>

The 48-foot-tall Black Hawk overlooks Oregon, Ill.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Black Hawk on the Rock River</h3>
<p>The Rock River town of <a href="http://www.oregonil.com/">Oregon, Ill.</a>, is the
home of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_Statue">Black Hawk</a>,
or the Eternal Indian.</p>
<p>In 1908, Chicago sculptor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorado_Taft">Lorado
Taft</a> started the 48-foot-tall
concrete statue on a river bluff that once was part of an art colony
that Taft founded in 1898.</p>
<p>Today, the statue is in <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/dnr/Parks/Pages/Lowden.aspx">Lowden State
Par</a>
<a href="http://dnr.state.il.us/lands/landmgt/parks/r1/lowdensp.htm">k</a>, across
the river from Oregon.</p>
<p>The statue is not a likeness of the Sauk leader Black Hawk, though Taft
said it was inspired by him.</p>
<p>Black Hawk became a tragic figure in 1832, when he tried to lead more
than 1,000 followers back to their village of Saukenuk, where Rock
Island now stands.</p>
<p>A military force of soldiers and volunteers, including a young private
named Abraham Lincoln, mobilized to stop him, and belligerent
politicians and newspaper editors called for scalps.</p>
<p>Black Hawk fled north along the Rock River and tried to surrender. The
sorry episode ended with a massacre on the Mississippi River near De
Soto, Wis.</p>
<p>&quot;Rock River was a beautiful country,&quot; Black Hawk said. &quot;I loved my
towns, my cornfields, and the home of my people. I fought for it.&quot;</p>
<h3>Smokey the Bear</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distractions_59.jpg" alt="Roadside Distraction No. 59." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Smokey the Bear lives in International Falls.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>International Falls is the home of Smokey the Bear.</p>
<p>This Minnesota paper-mill town, across the Rainy River from Fort
Frances, Ont., is devoted to cutting down and processing trees, not
preserving them.</p>
<p>The forests are next door in Voyageurs National Park, which has 344
square miles of water, islands, peninsulas and shoreline.</p>
<p>Smokey, who is 26 feet tall and was made in 1954, lives in Smokey Bear
Park. In summer, there are concerts there on Wednesday nights.</p>
