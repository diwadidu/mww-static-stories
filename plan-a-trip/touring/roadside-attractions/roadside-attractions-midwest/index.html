<h2>Do you love the odd and offbeat? Here's where to find some prime examples.</h2>

The big muskie in Hayward.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At MidwestWeekends, we love anything that makes us veer off the road and
say, &quot;Wow, what the heck is that?&quot;</p>
<p>A lot of highly unusual things can be found along the streets and
highways of the Upper Midwest. We call these things Roadside
Distractions, and we always take a photo.</p>
<p>Here are some of our favorites.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadside-attractions/roadside-attractions-upper-midwest/">Roadside Distractions
II</a>.</p>
<p>And to plan your own road trip in the state that inspired the most
unusual artists, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadside-attractions/Wisconsin-folk-art/">Road trip: Wisconsin's concrete
art</a>.</p>
<h3>Hayward's muskie</h3>
<p>Perhaps the most iconic giant attraction in Wisconsin is the 143-foot
muskellunge at the <a href="http://www.freshwater-fishing.org/index.php">Fresh Water Fishing Hall of
Fame</a> in Hayward.</p>
<p>Visitors can climb into its toothy jaw, 48 feet above the ground, which
holds 20 and is a popular place for weddings.</p>
<p>Hayward is famous for its world-record muskies, many pulled from the big
Chippewa Flowage, though it lost the title for Musky Capital of the
World to Boulder Junction, across the state.</p>
<p>In June,  it holds a big <a href="http://www.muskyfestival.com/">Musky Festival</a>, with watermelon- and ice-cream eating contests, a carnival,
children's games and a parade. And of course, there are fishing and
casting contests.</p>
<p>For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/lumberjacks-hayward/">Hayward's
lumberjacks</a>

Hayward</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distraction_20.jpg" alt="Roadside Distraction #24." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Big Fish in Bena, Minn.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Bena's Big Fish</h3>
<p>The Big Fish in the northern Minnesota town of Bena, near the southern
shore of Lake Winnibigoshish.</p>
<p>This 65-foot-long muskie stretches outside a supper club called — what
else? — the <a href="http://bigfishsupperclub.com/">Big Fish</a>.</p>
<p>Built in 1958, it began life as the Big Muskie Drive-in, with a window
near its gills to serve customers. It became an icon of American road
culture and made a cameo in the 1983 movie &quot;National Lampoon's
Vacation.&quot;</p>
<p>Over time, the wood-and-tarpaper muskie deteriorated and was used as a
storage shed.</p>
<p>In 2009, the Preservation Alliance of Minnesota put the Big Fish on its
annual list of the state's <a href="http://www.preservationnation.org/magazine/2009/todays-news/save-minnesotas-big-fish.html">10 Most Endangered Historic
Places</a>.</p>
<p>A local donor stepped in with financial support, and the muskie was
restored.</p>
<h3>Goats in Sister Bay</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distraction_37.jpg" alt="Roadside Distractions #23." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The goats on the roof of Al Johnson's Swedish Restaurant.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In summer, these goats spend the day grazing on the roof of <a href="http://www.aljohnsons.com">Al
Johnson's Swedish Restaurant</a> in Sister Bay,
Wis.</p>
<p>The goats are even more famous than the Swedish pancakes with
lingonberries at this Door County landmark, started in 1949 and now
operated by Al and Ingert Johnson's children Lars, Rolf and Annika.</p>
<p>The first goat arrived as a gag gift in 1973, the year the family
renovated and put a sod roof on the restaurant. The goat attracted the
attention of so many passersby that the Johnsons put more goats up to
graze.</p>
<p>In 1996, they trademarked the right to use goats on a roof to attract
business.</p>
<p>The goats live in a barn during the winter and at night, and climb up to
the roof on a stairway each morning.</p>
<h3>The Music Man in Mason City</h3>
<p>Mason City, Iowa, is the location of this statue of Meredith Willson as
the Music Man.</p>
<p>Willson, whose play &quot;The Music Man&quot; became a Broadway smash in 1957
and Hollywood hit in 1962, grew up in Mason City.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distractions_9.jpg" alt="Roadside Distractions #22." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Meredith Willson as "The Music Man" in Mason City.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>He was a member of its renowned high-school band before moving to New
York and the music school that became Juilliard.</p>
<p>Besides &quot;The Music Man,&quot; he also wrote &quot;The Unsinkable Molly
Brown&quot; and composed the Beatles hit &quot;Till There Was You&quot; and
&quot;It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas,&quot; as well as many
other standards.</p>
<p>He was a music director and performer on pioneering radio shows, working
with George Burns, Gracie Allen and Jack Benny, and composed film
scores, earning Oscar nominations and winning a Grammy and Tony awards.</p>
<p>The statue is on the grounds of Willson's 1895 boyhood home, which is
next to the 1912 River City Streetscape and Meredith Willson Museum
inside Music Man Square.</p>
<p>The town still is known for its marching band. Over Memorial Day
weekend, Mason City's <a href="http://www.nibandfest.com/">North Iowa Band
Festival</a> draws bands from around the
Midwest. There's a carnival, craft show and car cruise, but don't miss
the 10 a.m. Saturday band parade on Saturday.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_grove_concrete_viking.jpg" alt="A concrete Viking in Spring Grove." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Tovar the Terrible in Spring Grove, Minn.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For more about Mason City, also known for the last remaining hotel
designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/wright-hotel-mason-city/">Wright in Mason
City</a>.</p>
<h3>Tovar in Spring Grove</h3>
<p>Tovar the Terrible lives in Spring Grove, in the southeast corner of
Minnesota. The 12-foot Viking stands in front of the old creamery.</p>
<p>A few feet away, a troll with a &quot;Belly by Budweiser&quot; banner draped
across its bulbous brown stomach leers at passersby. The figures were
made by full-blooded Norwegian Owen Vaaler, a local businessman.</p>
<p>Across the street, there are three more figures in Viking Memorial Park.
There's a traditionally heroic bronze Viking, dedicated to ancestors
&quot;who started here with so little that we might have everything.&quot;</p>
<p>And there are two smaller bronze figures, one holding a wrench and one a
pitchfork.</p>
<p>They're Ola and Per, who appeared in a nationally beloved comic strip
written by Spring Grove native Peter Rosendahl between 1918 and 1942 for
the Decorah Posten.</p>
<p>The pair's bumbling misadventures illustrated the bumpy path undertaken
by Norwegian immigrants.</p>

<h3>Clair d'Loon in Mercer</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distraction_50.jpg" alt="Roadside Distraction #20." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Clair D'Loon in Mercer, Wis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the north woods of Minnesota and Wisconsin, everybody loves to spot a
loon and hear its haunting call. Some towns carry the love of a loon
even farther — towns like the northeast Wisconsin town of Mercer.</p>
<p>The Mercer loon can be seen along U.S. 51, halfway between Minocqua and
Hurley. Her nickname: Clair d'Loon.</p>
<p>Mercer calls itself <a href="http://www.mercerwi.com/">Loon Capital of the
World!</a> It's got a good claim to that title,
being the jumping-off point for the Turtle-Flambeau Scenic Waters Area,
a miniature Boundary Waters that's managed by the state DNR.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/turtle-flambeau-mercer-wisconsin/">Tranquility in the
Turtle-Flambeau</a>.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, there are two other giant loons.</p>
<p>On Minnesota's Iron Range, the town of Virginia has a pretty good lock
on its claim to the World's Largest Floating Loon, which is anchored on
Silver Lake.</p>
<p>And in northwest Minnesota, the town of
<a href="http://www.vergasmn.com/">Vergas</a>, between Detroit Lakes and Fergus
Falls, calls itself Home of the World's Largest Loon, which is
arguable. The Vergas loon, which sits on the shore of Long Lake, is 20
foot tall, but the Virginia loon is 20 feet long.</p>
<p>Both loons beat Mercer's Clair, who is only 16 feet tall but, we think,
the prettiest loon.</p>
<p>Manitowish Waters, famous for Dillinger's shootout at Little Bohemia,
is just down the road from Mercer. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/gangsters-wisconsin/">Chasing gangsters in
Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<h3>Karl Oskar and Kristina in Lindstrom</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distractions_29.jpg" alt="Roadside Distraction #19." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Lindstrom, Minn., is the location of Karl Oskar and Kristina, the main
characters of Vilhelm Moberg's wildly popular &quot;Emigrants&quot; novels.</p>
<p>In Chisago County, Swedish settlers found &quot;a rich and stoneless
Småland,&quot; the impoverished province so many emigrants left. Their
letters home started a boom that eventually gave Chisago County the
largest concentration of Swedes outside Sweden.</p>
<p>They became American, but after a century, they retained so much of the
old language and so many of the customs that Swedish writer Vilhelm
Moberg came to the area in 1948 to research a quartet of historical
novels.</p>
<p>He explored the area by bicycle — there's a statue of him and his
bicycle in Chisago City — and based his novels partly on the journals
of immigrant Erik Norelius, who left Sweden with Daniel Lindström in
1853.</p>
<p>Moberg's 19th-century characters - especially Kristina, who was
reluctant to leave her family in Sweden — seemed so real to modern
Swedes that they're still traveling to Minnesota to see where the
fictional couple lived and died.</p>
<p>In 1995, Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA premiered their
musical &quot;Kristina från Duvemåla&quot; in Sweden. It was a success there
and also in the United States, where it opened in Minneapolis as
&quot;Kristina&quot; a year later.</p>

Minnesota</a>.</p>

King Gambrinus in La Crosse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>King Gambrinus in La Crosse</h3>
<p>In the 19th century, the fortunes of La Crosse, Wis., rose on a tide of
beer from many breweries. G. Heileman was the last of the big breweries,
and in 1939, it installed a statue of King Gambrinus in front of its
building.</p>
<p>Gambrinus is a legendary king of Flanders; some say he invented beer,
others that he was a 13th century Flemish warrior who was acclaimed for
his beer recipes.</p>
<p>Gambrinus still is toasting visitors, though Heileman now is City
Brewery.</p>
<p>La Crosse always has been a destination for drinkers, with as many as
eight breweries, three colleges and a downtown with so many consecutive
bars it once held a Guinness world record.</p>
<p>The yearly beer festival (besides Oktoberfest in fall) is <a href="http://betweenthebluffsbeerfest.com/">Between the
Bluffs Beer, Wine and Cheese
Festival</a> in April.</p>

<h3>The Root Beer Lady in Ely</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distractions_35.jpg" alt="Roadside Distraction #17." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Dorothy Molter Museum in Ely.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Ely is the home of the <a href="http://rootbeerlady.com/">Root Beer Lady</a>,
Dorothy Molter.</p>
<p>Molter, a Chicago nurse who came to Ely in 1930, was the last person
allowed to live within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. She
supported herself by brewing root beer, which she gave to passing
canoeists for donations.</p>
<p>After her death in 1986, her cabins were dragged by dog sled from Knife
Lake, near the Canadian border, to their new home in Ely.</p>
<p>Today, they're part of the Dorothy Molter Museum, where visitors can
see the feisty outdoorswoman in a video. The bottles she used and reused
now are collector's items.</p>
<p>The museum is open daily from Memorial Day to Labor Day, weekends in
September, Saturdays in October and occasionally in winter.</p>

Ely</a>.</p>
<h3>A concrete moose in Phillips</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distraction_47.jpg" alt="Roadside Distraction #16." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A moose at the Wisconsin Concrete Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The <a href="http://www.friendsoffredsmith.org/">Wisconsin Concrete Park</a> in the
north-central town of Phillips is the location of this
concrete-and-glass moose.</p>
<p>Fred Smith, their creator, is best known for creating people, especially
those he liked or admired. He made the man who delivered kerosene to
local farmers in an ox-drawn wagon and Mabel the Milker, who milked by
hand.</p>
<p>He built the whole Budweiser Clydesdale team and also Kit Carson, Paul
Bunyan and Sacagawea, the Shoshone woman who led the explorers Lewis and
Clark.</p>
<p>&quot;She's the one who opened up the whole country,&quot; Smith said.
&quot;That's why I got so many Indians here. I like Indians because
they're damn smart people.&quot;</p>
<p>Oddly, his people and horses are quite stiff. Of all the 203 figures he
built between 1950 and 1964, the moose are the most lifelike.</p>
<p>During his lifetime, the locals thought Smith was a crackpot. Today,
thousands of people annually visit the park, which was restored by the
Kohler Foundation and now is operated by the Friends of Fred Smith.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distraction_26.jpg" alt="Roadside Distraction #15." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The coffee cup in Vining, Minn.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The park is just south of Phillips on Wisconsin 13, just north of U.S.
8, and open daily. On the second Saturday in August, the Friends throw a
Wisconsin Concrete Park Celebration, with guided tours, music and, of
course, art activities for everyone.</p>
<h3>Sculptures in Vining</h3>
<p>In the lakes area of west-central Minnesota, east of Fergus Falls,
retired construction foreman Ken Nyberg has furnished the village of
Vining with a whole set of quirky scrap-metal sculptures.</p>
<p>In addition to the pouring coffee, there's a foot with an oversized big
toe, a square knot, a 20-foot clothes pin, a pliers gripping a
cockroach, an elephant made of lawnmower blades, a knife slicing a
watermelon and a potted cactus.</p>
<p>Here are some nice
<a href="http://thebigstuffproject.blogspot.com/2008/07/vining-sculpture-park.html">photos</a>
of the sculptures. There's also a more traditional cowboy and an Indian
on a horse, plus smaller sculptures in Nyberg's nearby yard.</p>
<p>Vining is on the <a href="http://byways.org/explore/byways/2242/travel.html">Otter Trail Scenic
Byway</a>, which
happens to be thick with giant roadside attractions. For more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/otter-trails/">Otter trail country</a>.</p>
<h3>The hodag of Rhinelander</h3>
<p>The fearsome hodag lives in Rhinelander, Wis.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distraction_46.jpg" alt="Roadside Distraction #14." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The hodag is the mascot of Rhinelander, Wis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This mythical beast was born in the logging camps around this
north-woods town. Camp newcomers were first to be regaled with stories
about it, supplemented by bloodcurdling wails from the nearby swamp.</p>
<p>Then, in 1896, timber cruiser Gene Shepard actually came up with a
spiked, leathery carcass he said he'd found in the swamps. He managed
to keep the hoax going for a week before confessing that he'd made it.</p>
<p>The locals didn't mind. By then, Rhinelander had acquired the nickname
Hodag City and a mascot for its sports teams. The beast also has lent
its name to a big <a href="http://www.hodag.com/">country festival</a> in July.</p>
<p>The hodag now crouches outside the visitors center year-round, and
smaller, artist-decorated hodags stand around town in summer and are
shown off in parades.</p>
<h3>St. Urho in Finn land</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/e/menagha_st_urho.jpg" alt="St. Urho the grasshopper-slayer." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
St. Urho in Menahga, Minn.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>St. Urho is still spearing grasshoppers in <a href="http://www.menahga.com/">Menahga,
Minn</a>.</p>
<p>Menahga, south of Park Rapids in Minnesota's lake resort country, was
settled predominantly by Finns.</p>
<p>According to legend, a plague of grasshoppers once threatened the wild
grapes that blanketed ancient Finland, but they were banished by a chant
from St. Urho (&quot;<em>Heinasirkka, heinasirkka, menetaalta hiiteen</em>,&quot; or,
&quot;Grasshopper, grasshopper, go away&quot;).</p>
<p>Some people call St. Urho the Finnish version of St. Patrick, who is
said to have driven snakes from ancient Ireland.</p>
<p>Along with the Minnesota town of Finland, Menahga celebrates St. Urho's
Day when other towns celebrate St. Patrick's Day, with music, dancing
and costumes of the traditional purple and green.</p>
<h3>Larry the Logroller in Wabeno</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distractions_13.jpg" alt="Roadside Distractions #11." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Larry the Logroller in Wabeno, Wis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Larry the Logroller lives in Wabeno, Wis.</p>
<p>A century ago, lumberjacks cleared the pine forests around this hamlet,
midway between Tomahawk and Marinette. Today, the surrounding land is
part of Nicolet National Forest.</p>
<p>The old days can be revisited at the Wabeno Logging Museum, which has a
replica of a logging camp in addition to 21-foot, 9-inch Larry, who is
carrying a grappling hook used on log drives down rivers.</p>
<p>If you've never seen Larry the Logroller but think he looks awfully
familiar, that's because he's also a Muffler Man.</p>
<p>Starting in 1962, nearly 300 of these towering figures were made by
International Fiberglass of Venice, Calif. The first figure was a Paul
Bunyan holding an ax, made for the PB Cafe on Route 66 in Flagstaff,
Ariz.</p>
<p>The company then got large orders from Texaco and Phillips for figures
who could hold mufflers and tires. Others were adapted into lumberjacks,
Vikings, cowboys, Indians and even spacemen and Alfred E. Neuman, the
mascot of Mad magazine.</p>
<p>In Bemidji, Minn., the big Indian in front of Morell's Chippewa Trading
Post also is a Muffler Man.</p>
<h3>Rocky Taconite in Silver Bay</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distraction_19.jpg" alt="Rocky Taconite in Silver Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Rocky Taconite can be seen in Silver Bay, Minn.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Rocky Taconite celebrates the resurrection of the iron-ore mining
industry on Minnesota's Iron Range and its shipping ports along the
North Shore.</p>
<p>Rocky stands atop a rock slab just west of Minnesota 61 on County Road 5
in Silver Bay, which was created in 1954 around a new plant built to
process <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taconite">taconite</a>.</p>
<p>Considered a waste rock when high-grade iron ore was plentiful, taconite
became valuable when a University of Minnesota engineer figured out how
to extract the ore and roll it into pellets.</p>
<p>A plaque at Rocky's base explains that he pays tribute to the turning
of &quot;a useless rock into a useful, valuable product and a huge new
industry for Minnesota.&quot;</p>
<p>Rocky is just one of many big mascots around the lake; for more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/giant-statues-lake-superior/">Giants of Lake
Superior</a>.</p>

<p>Kate Fitzwilliams of Baraboo, Wis., was the first to identify the

west of Madison.</p>
<p>He's the <a href="http://www.mounthorebtrollway.com/fieldguide/tourist.html">Tourist
Troll</a>, one
of 22 wooden trolls along Main Street (aka The Trollway) and around
town.</p>
<p>And the rat? According to carver Michael Feeney, it &quot;follows him
everywhere he goes, subsisting on The Tourist Troll's constant trail of
crumb and scraps of food.&quot;</p>
<p>Mount Horeb has gone to town with the troll theme, conceived because the
population once was predominantly Norwegian and also because it needed
to draw tourists back to its businesses after downtown was bypassed by
Wisconsin 18/151.</p>
<p>It calls itself Troll Capital of the World, and it can be found at
<a href="http://trollway.com/">Trollway.com</a>. The local brewpub is called the
Grumpy Troll, which hosts the Thirsty Troll Brew Fest in September.</p>

<h3>A jester in Pipestone</h3>
<p>This oddity can be seen in the southwest corner of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Pipestone is the home of this irreverent jester, who is thumbing his
nose at . . . well, we don't know.</p>
<p>He's one of a dozen sandstone gargoyles, including an ogre blowing a
raspberry, on the quartzite facade of the 1896 Leon Moore Building.</p>
<p>The downtown building is one of 20 on the National Register of Historic
Places, each made of the locally quarried pink rock, as hard and grainy
as pipestone is soft and smooth.</p>
<p>Leon Moore not only owned a quartzite quarry, but he could sculpt stone.
And obviously, he had a sense of humor.</p>

<h3>Hamburger Charlie in Seymour</h3>
<p>In the friendly little town of Seymour, Wis., just west of Green Bay, a
12-foot statue of Hamburger Charlie stands in the town park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/roadside_distractions_7.jpg" alt="Roadside Distractions #7." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Hamburger Charlie lives in Seymour, Wis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The story is that in 1885, at the age of 15, Charlie Nagreen loaded up
his oxcart with meatballs and drove from his home in Hortonville, Wis.,
to the fair in Seymour.</p>
<p>His meatballs didn't sell well on plates because people wanted to keep
moving between exhibits. So Charlie squashed the meatballs between
slices of bread, put onions on top and called it a hamburger, after the
German town where ground beefsteak was popular.</p>
<p>He sold his burgers at area fairs for the next 65 years. In 2007, the
Wisconsin Legislature recognized Seymour as the Original Home of the
Hamburger.</p>
<p>Every year, on the first Saturday in August, the town celebrates <a href="http://www.homeofthehamburger.org/">Burger
Fest</a>, featuring a hot-air balloon rally, a
hamburger-press strength contest, a ketchup slide, a burger-eating
contest and the World's Largest Hamburger Parade.</p>
<p>There's also a giant fiberglass burger on a grill in the town park. We
don't know how much it weighs, but at Burger Fest in 2001, the
townsfolk cooked up a real burger that weighed 8,266 pounds.</p>

<h3>Herman Rusch and Prairie Moon</h3>
<p>You can find the <a href="http://www.kohlerfoundation.org/preservation/preserved-sites/prairie-moon-sculpture-garden-and-museum/">Prairie Moon Sculpture Garden &amp;
Museum</a>
and its creator, Herman Rusch, along the Mississippi River in southwest
Wisconsin, halfway between Alma and Fountain City in Cochrane.</p>
<p>Rusch was a retired farmer who, looking for &quot;a good way to kill old-age
boredom,&quot; began fashioning sculptures out of concrete, stone and
broken glass.</p>
<p>By the time he died in 1985 at age 100 — &quot;Beauty creates the will to
live,&quot; he said — he'd fashioned nearly 40 sculptures, including a
Hindu temple, three dinosaurs, a crenellated stone watchtower and a
beautiful arched fence, with conical red posts tipped with gold.</p>
<p>There's also a self-portrait in concrete, but it's a poor substitute
for the real Rusch, who often played his fiddle for visitors.</p>
<p>&quot;I met Herman Rusch when he was almost 100,&quot; says Leo Smith, a
renowned carver who works in Fountain City. &quot;He was a little bitty guy
who was always smiling, and when he played the fiddle, he exuded
joy.&quot;</p>
<p>The Kohler Foundation restored Rusch's works, as well as three by
Rushford, Minn., farmer Halvor Landsverk, and curious visitors can roam
the grounds from dawn to dusk.</p>
<p>The Cochrane-Fountain City area was a wellspring of what the foundation
calls outsider art. It's also restored and added several pieces by
Cochrane shopkeeper Fred Schlosstein, a shopkeeper in Cochrane, and John
and Bertha Mehringer of Fountain City.</p>
<p>Between 1920 and 1940, Schlosstein created a concrete village in his
yard. It included people, buildings and animals-elephants, deer,
bears, herons-plus castles and planters.</p>
<p>He also kept two alligators in ponds. He died in 1953, two years before
Herman Rusch started working on his outsider-art oeuvre.</p>
<p>The Mehringers who built their Fountain City Rock Garden between 1933
and 1935, with rocks, mirrors and many shards of clear, brown and green
glass. Several of their birdhouses have been moved to Prairie Moon.</p>

<h3>The Snowshoe Priest of Lake Superior</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/a/father_baraga.jpg" alt="Roadside Distractions #5." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>High above <em>Michigan's L'Anse Bay</em> , between the Keweenaw and Abbaye
peninsulas west of Marquette, a 35-foot bronze statue of a robed priest,
holding a cross and snowshoes, stands on a cluster of steel clouds,
suspended 25 feet above the ground by beams.</p>
<p>It's the <strong>Shrine of the Snowshoe Priest</strong> .</p>
<p>The Snowshoe Priest was Father Frederic Baraga, a native of Slovenia and
one of the original tough guys of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Long before John Beargrease delivered the mail along Minnesota's North
Shore, Father Baraga delivered the Word-everywhere.</p>
<p>He arrived in 1830 at age 23 and traveled by canoe, horse, dog sled and
snowshoe between Ojibwe settlements in Sault Ste. Marie in Michigan,
Grand Portage in Minnesota and La Pointe on Wisconsin's Madeline
Island.</p>
<p>He became known as the Snowshoe Priest and, in his spare time, compiled
an Ojibwe dictionary that still is used.</p>
<p>He became the first bishop of Upper Michigan in 1853, served until his
death in 1868 and is buried in the 1890 Romanesque cathedral in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/marquette-michigan/">Marquette</a>, where efforts to canonize him began in 1952.</p>
<p>Those efforts got a big boost in March 2010, when a patient with a liver
tumor, as shown by CT scan and ultrasound, prayed to the bishop and
placed his stole over the pain. After that, exploratory surgery found no
tumor.</p>
<p>If the miracle is recognized as authentic, the diocese will need to
verify one more miracle in order for the bishop to be declared a saint.</p>
<p>There's another memorial on the Cross River on Minnesota's North
Shore, where the priest blew safely ashore during a storm in 1846. It's
known as <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadside-attractions/father-baraga-cross/">Father Baraga's Cross</a>.</p>
<p>The shrine is one of many roadside distractions around Lake Superior.

<h3>An American Gothic barn</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/e/cedar_rapids_grant_wood_shed.jpg" alt="Roadside art in eastern Iowa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Just east of <em>Cedar Rapids, Iowa</em> , on U.S. 30 near the entrance to
<a href="http://www.iowadnr.gov/Destinations/StateParksRecAreas/IowasStateParks/ParkDetails.aspx?ParkID=610113&amp;idAdminBoundary=202">Palisades-Kepler State
Park</a>, local art teacher Mark Benesh has painted a reproduction of Grant
Wood's famous &quot;American Gothic&quot; on the front of a barn.</p>
<p>Grant Wood was born nearby in rural Anamosa and moved to Cedar Rapids
when he was 10. He studied at the School of the Art Institute in Chicago
and traveled to Europe, but he returned to Iowa to paint and teach art
at the University of Iowa.</p>
<p>&quot;American Gothic&quot; is at Chicago's Art Institute, but the <a href="http://www.crma.org/">Cedar
Rapids Museum of Art</a> holds the largest collection
of Wood's work. The studio where he painted &quot;American Gothic&quot; in
1930 is three blocks away, and tours are free.</p>
<p>To see the rolling countryside Wood loved to paint, drive the 68-mile
<a href="http://byways.org/explore/byways/2183/travel.html">Grant Wood Scenic
Byway</a> from Anamosa
to Macquoketa and on to Bellevue on the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>The estate on which Wood and two other artists founded the <a href="http://www.grantwoodartgallery.org/stonecitycolony.htm">Stone City
Art Colony</a> in
1932 still can be seen just west of Anamosa overlooking the Wapsipinicon
River.</p>
<p>The house depicted in &quot;American Gothic&quot; is in Eldon, Iowa, near
Ottumwa, and is open daily for free tours. The <a href="https://americangothichouse.org/">American Gothic House &amp;
Center</a> provides pitchforks and
costumes for photos.</p>
<h3>A covered bridge in Wisconsin</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/o/covered_bridge.jpg" alt="A bridge on Wisconsin's Glacial River State Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Around here, folks have a powerful sense of nostalgia-call it the
Norman Rockwell effect.</p>
<p>We love to go on scenic drives in the countryside, and we love our
covered bridges, even the ones that only look old.</p>
<p>This is one of the prettier ones we've seen. It spans a tiny creek that
flows from the southeast corner of Lake Koshkonong, between <em>Fort
Atkinson and Milton in southeast Wisconsin</em> , and it features a roof
with a caboose-style cupola.</p>
<p>It was built in 2000 with century-old barn timbers, mostly for the
benefit of bicyclists on the 8½-mile Glacial River Trail, which
parallels Wisconsin 26. It's also become popular as a setting for
wedding photographs.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, bicyclists also got lucky on a 12-mile spur of the <a href="http://lakewobegontrail.com/">Lake
Wobegon Trail</a> in central Minnesota. From
Albany, the trail heads north to Holdingford, where a covered bridge
crosses the Two Rivers River.</p>
<p>Holdingford, which built the bridge in 2008, now calls itself &quot;Gateway
to Lake Wobegon.&quot;</p>
<p>For photos of three more covered bridges, see our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150457491940129.419756.104777055128&amp;type=1">Facebook

<h3>Oz Park in Chicago</h3>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/parks-facilities/oz-park">Oz
Park</a> in
Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood</strong> is the site of the Scarecrow.</p>
<p>The Scarecrow is accompanied by the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion and
Dorothy and Toto (see our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150438772430129.415815.104777055128&amp;type=1">Facebook
album</a>
for pictures). The park honors L. Frank Baum, who lived in nearby
Humboldt Park when he published &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; in
1900.</p>
<p>It includes Emerald Gardens and Dorothy's Playlot, which also honors
retired local schoolteacher Dorothy Melamerson, whose savings funded
many park improvements.</p>
<p>The park is a block east of the corner of Webster Avenue and Halsted
Street, an easy trip from downtown and a nice destination for children
who are tired of sightseeing and museums.</p>

<h3>Hobos in Harmony</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/a/harmony_hobos.jpg" alt="Roadside Distractions #1." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A trio of hobos marks the start of the Harmony-Preston Valley State
Trail in the <em>southeast Minnesota town of Harmony</em> .</p>
<p>&quot;Life Along the Rails&quot; is the work of local woodcarver Stanley &quot;Slim&quot;
Maroushek, who trained with the famous Bily brothers of Spillville,
Iowa.</p>
<p>The figures pay tribute to the hobos who once camped near the train
depot and looked for odd jobs they could do around town. The locals
often called them hoe-boys, since many weeded gardens.</p>
<p>This shows Steamtrain Satch (in front), Handbag Hallie (in back) and
Hank (with bag). Other hobos are Sleepy Slim, Oklahoma Oscar and Dawg.</p>
<p>Harmony is only three miles from the Iowa border and is known for
Niagara Cave.</p>
