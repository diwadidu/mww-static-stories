<h2>Beneath the surface, a Minnesota river town moves fast.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/winona_sugarloaf_skating.jpg" alt="Inline skater on trail in Winona" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Skaters, runners and bicyclists love the five-mile trail around Lake
Winona.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For a river town that has everything going for it, Winona is a little
hard for a tourist to get to know.</p>
<p>Those who venture off U.S. 61 find a downtown that's long, spread out
and a little forlorn on weekends. To find its Mississippi riverfront,
they have to cut across train tracks and around a concrete levee wall.</p>
<p>For 50 years, a paddlewheeler sat atop the riverbank, serving as museum,
event center and gathering spot. The Julius C. Wilkie was only a replica
of a steamboat, but it served as city icon and festival namesake, so
when the rotting structure was demolished in 2008, it left a dent in the
city's identity.</p>
<p>Sugar Loaf Mountain, the city's other icon, is literally dented.
Quarrymen whittled the limestone pinnacle down to its present shape and
used the stone for Winona's sidewalks; before that, it was a dome
called Wapasha's Cap, after the influential Dakota leader whose camp
was at its base.</p>
<p>The town is famous for its stained glass, but most of the buildings that
contain them are closed on weekends. It's also famous for Watkins home
remedies, made in Winona since 1885 and still on the shelves.</p>
<p>What kind of town is this, anyway?</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>To find out, just look around: It's a beautiful town.</p>
<h3>Stunning views</h3>
<p>Winona is blessed by location. The stretch of river between Winona and
Dubuque, Iowa, lined by towering green bluffs, is the loveliest on the
Mississippi, often likened to the Rhine in Germany.</p>
<p>Even starchy Lt. Zebulon Pike was struck by the view on his way up the
Mississippi in 1805, calling it &quot;a prospect so variegated and romantic
that a man may scarcely expect to enjoy such a one but twice or thrice
in the course of his life.&quot;</p>
<p>It's most stunning from above, where the Garvin Heights overlook
affords views of the town, thick with steeples and domes and spread
between Lake Winona and the twisting Mississippi.</p>
<p>But it's also striking from the streets, whose stone edifices sport an
abundance of turrets and towers, and from the water, where arrowhead
marshes and wooded islands dot sloughs and channels.</p>
<p>One June, I was in Winona for Steamboat Days, which celebrates the
town's founding by a river captain who, upon the signing of the 1851
Treaty of Mendota, hurried upstream in his steamboat Nominee to stake a
claim to land still occupied by a Dakota village of 300.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/winona_steamboat_float.jpg" alt="A steamboat float in Winona's Steamboat Days parade." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Winona royalty rides a float during the town's Steamboat Days.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The parade is the highlight of the festival, and I looked for clues to
the city in its procession of princesses, Percherons and Shriners in
coolie hats, feathered headdresses and toy-sized red Corvettes.</p>
<p>It was great spectacle but not very illuminating, so I headed over to
the Winona County Historical Society Museum, in a 1915 armory built to
look like a medieval fortress. After Europeans replaced the Dakota, many
of whom were taken away in steamboats, Winona became a busy frontier
port.</p>
<p>The flimsy steamboats had such a shallow draft pilots often took
shortcuts across flooded fields, but they lasted for only a few years
before they exploded, burned, collided with other boats, were crushed by
ice or snagged on submerged logs.</p>
<p>After this colorful era, Winona became a grain-shipping terminus, then a
lumber-milling town.</p>
<p>In 1885, Plainview businessman J.R. Watkins moved to Winona and began
using wagon salesmen to distribute his liniments and tonics, which
contained stiff doses of alcohol.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>By the turn of the century, the wide-roving Watkins Men had made him
rich.</p>
<p>Winona's wealth gave the town of 27,000 an unusually large number of
splendid buildings, many of which barely escaped urban renewal in the
1960s.</p>
<p>The castlelike 1888 county courthouse is perhaps best known, followed by
the 1912 Prairie School-style Merchant's National Bank and the 1895
Church of St. Stanislaus, whose blindingly white domes can be seen from
overlooks 20 miles down the river.</p>
<p>All three have beautiful stained glass, as does the 1911 Prairie-style
Watkins administration building and the historical society museum, whose
art-glass window is a visual history of the town.</p>
<p>On Broadway, the 1886 Alexander Mansion B&amp;B has been painstakingly
restored after years as an apartment building. Now, it's opulent enough
for its namesake, Maude Alexander, whose family was enriched when her
brother married J.R. Watkins' only daughter and her mother became J.R.
Watkins' second wife.</p>
<p>The gleaming Victorian decor, evening wine and hors d'oeuvres and
four-course organic breakfast impressed my fellow guests.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/winona_garvin_heights.jpg" alt="A Mississippi River view from Winona." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From Garvin Heights, there's a panoramic view of the river valley.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Gerald O'Dwyer of Chicago had come to Winona three weeks earlier for a
wedding, and he liked the river valley and town so much he returned to
spend the weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;When I came up, I got whiplash, it was so beautiful,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm
just taken with this area.&quot;</p>
<h3>Exploring lakes and sloughs</h3>
<p>In summer, people head outdoors to bike or skate the five miles around
Lake Winona. Just across the bridge in Trempealeau National Wildlife
Refuge, they get on their bikes and head south on the 24-mile Great
River State Trail.</p>
<p>They swim in Lake Goodview or even in the Mississippi River from the
beach on Latsch Island, across from downtown.</p>
<p>And they explore the sloughs, which are perfect for the boats made right
in town by Wenonah Canoe. When I was in town, I kayaked on the quiet
Prairie Island sloughs.</p>
<p>Herons flapped and kingfishers squabbled as I paddled past the wooded
islands where the Dakota built winter homes, to get away from the
prairie winds.</p>
<p>In his 1883 &quot;Life on the Mississippi,&quot; Mark Twain called them the
Thousand Islands, &quot;too beautiful for anything; green? Why, you never
saw foliage so green, nor placed so thick . . .&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/winona_st_stanislaus.jpg" alt="The white domes of Winona's St. Stanislaus gleam in the sun." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The white domes of St. Stanislaus are a city landmark.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Emerging onto the Mississippi just below Lock and Dam 5A, I watched a
train roll along at the foot of the opposite bluff as I paddled upriver
and back into the sloughs.</p>
<p>That took only an hour, so I drove farther along Prairie Island Road to
Verchota Landing and put in there, paddling northwest.</p>
<p>The gracefully rounded bluffs on both sides, a radiant green in the
early-evening sun, were a mesmerizing sight.</p>
<h3>A city of festivals</h3>
<p>These days, however, Winona is banking on more than its beauty.</p>
<p>In 2002, three nationally known directors who were working together on a
University of Minnesota/Guthrie Theater actor-training program decided
Minnesota needed a professional summer Shakespeare festival.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They hadn't even considered Winona when the city began to court them,
alerted by Theatre du Mississippi director Maggy Jacqmin and her
husband, Will Kitchen, a Winona planning commission member who knew
someone who knew one of the directors.</p>
<p>By the festival's second season, theatergoers were coming in from 36
states, and the next year the season was expanded from five weeks to
six.</p>
<p>The festival now uses the campus of Winona State University and hopes to
build a permanent theater. In addition to the plays, festivities include
free concerts, lectures, actor conversations, an art exhibit, dramatic
vignettes and historic walking tours.</p>
<p>&quot;Winona, for me, is continually surprising,&quot; says founding director
Paul Barnes, a resident of Ashland, Ore., who says he now spends more
time in Winona than anywhere else.</p>
<p>&quot;I love its small-town ambience. It has kind of a down-and-dirty river
town kind of history, and it's a blue-collar town but has two
universities. It's a really interesting town, a real mix.&quot;</p>
<p>Things are happening in Winona. It has a fine restaurant, Signatures, at
the Bridges Golf Club in the bluffs above town. The man responsible,
state Sen. Bob Kierlin, also is behind the handsome Minnesota Marine Art
Museum on  Riverview Drive.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/winona_backwaters.jpg" alt="Mississippi backwaters in Winona." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Wisconsin's bluffs frame the Mississippi backwaters on the north edge
of town.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The city is working with consultants to figure out how to take advantage
of its riverfront.</p>
<p>&quot;They really have their eyes on the future,&quot; Barnes says.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it can always count on beauty.</p>
