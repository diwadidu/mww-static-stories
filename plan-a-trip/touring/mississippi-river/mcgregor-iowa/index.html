<h2>A picturesque river town in Iowa claims more than its share of characters.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/c/mcgregor_river.jpg" alt="McGregor from the river." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
McGregor's docks have a front-row view of river traffic.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Over the years, the byways around McGregor, Iowa, have seen an
extraordinary procession of people.</p>
<p>Between 650 and 1300, Woodland Indians built animal-shaped burial
mounds, 29 of which are preserved nearby at Effigy Mounds National
Monument.</p>
<p>In 1673, Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet arrived via the
Wisconsin River, claiming the land for France and paving the way for the
fur trade, whose center was just across the river in Prairie du Chien.</p>
<p>Lt. Zebulon Pike paddled through in 1805, choosing a site on the
500-foot bluffs south of town for a fort, though it was built instead on
the prairie across the river.</p>
<p>In 1837, Scotsman Alexander MacGregor started running a ferry across the
Mississippi. The new port of McGregor boomed during the Civil War, and
the streets became clogged by wagons full of grain from the wheat fields
to the west.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There was other river traffic, too. The young sons of harnessmaker
August Ringling saw their first circus performance when a showboat drew
up to McGregor's docks.</p>
<p>But railroads eclipsed the river, and McGregor faded. Until, that is,
the tourists came. Today, it's tourists who clog the streets, especially
on fall weekends.</p>
<p>This corner of Iowa is perhaps the most beautiful stretch of the
Mississippi, with its rounded bluffs framing a jumble of islands and
sloughs.</p>
<p>The two state parks atop the bluffs just south of McGregor have the
river's most spectacular views: Pikes Peak, with 12 miles of hiking and
skiing trails, and Wyalusing, across the river in Wisconsin, with 20.</p>
<p>McGregor itself is tucked away in a little bowl, hugged on three sides
by wooded bluffs.</p>
<p>There's no way to get there that's not relentlessly scenic: by way of
Decorah and bluff country from the west; along the River Road and
Lansing from the north; along the Wisconsin River Valley and Prairie du
Chien from the east; and via Dubuque and Guttenberg from the south.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/c/mcgregor_pikes_peak.jpg" alt="The view from Pikes Peak State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The view from Pikes Peak State Park is spectacular.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>One fall, I drove in from the west and stopped seven miles out of town
at Spook Cave, at the base of a bluff along Bloody Run Creek.</p>
<p>There, I piled into an old aluminum fishing boat with seven other people
and our teen-age guide, Randee, who explained that locals named the cave
for the hollow sound of water splashing over rock.</p>
<p>Then we glided into an opening, dynamited in 1953, and squeezed under a
low ceiling and through a passage.</p>
<p>&quot;We call this Lovers Lane, because you either learn to love the person
next to you or the wall,&quot; Randee said.</p>
<p>At first, we saw little besides broken-off stalagmites cemented around a
&quot;wishing well.&quot; Then we entered Formation Alley, with its glossy
Frozen Waterfall, soda straws and ribbon stalactites, with one pearly
white set called &quot;Jaws&quot; that did look just like a row of incisors.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Randee pointed out two bats, confirmed by shrieks from the boat behind
us, and pointed out the wooden shaft overhead where enterpreneur Gerald
Mielke brought in a tractor to clear out mud and rocks.</p>
<p>Farther down U.S. 18, halfway down the hill to McGregor, I found another
unusual attraction. It was Danial Slaughter's yard, part of a business
called Wood Crafts &amp; Junk, but also a folk-art extravaganza.</p>
<p>There was a quarter-ton painted Elvis carved from a tree trunk. There
was Pancho Villa, Uncle Sam, King Tut, Frankenstein, Paul Bunyan and a
giant nutcracker. And there were all kinds of gewgaws, stuck here and
there — bowling pins, license plates, carousel horses, antique gas
pumps.</p>
<p>Along Main Street, I stopped at the Historical Museum, which houses an
even more peculiar sight — sand &quot;paintings&quot; inside bottles.</p>
<p>Andrew Clemens was a local deaf man who, using 45 shades of sand he
scraped from the walls of a cave in Pikes Peak State Park, executed
impossibly intricate portrayals of Victorian houses, locomotive engines,
even George Washington on a horse.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/c/mcgregor_iowa_streets.jpg" alt="Historic buildings line McGregor's Main Street." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
McGregor's Main Street is framed by bluffs and lined with 19th-century
buildings.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>By the time Clemens died in 1894, at the age of 37, he was known among
high society around the world.</p>
<p>The slender hickory sticks he used to arrange the sand are displayed in
the museum, along with a bottle with a floral bouquet and the legend
&quot;Merry Christmas 1891,&quot; written in a flowing script of black sand.</p>
<p>There's another attraction down the street, at River Junction Trade Co.,
a shop that may as well be a museum.</p>
<p>Catering to re-enactors, theme-park actors and anyone else who needs an
outfit from the years 1870-1900 — &quot;the cowboy, the gunfighter and the
riverboat gambler,&quot; says owner Jim Boeke — River Junction carries
lace snoods, drover's shirts, ostrich-feather fans, carpetbags, period
pistols, sheriff's badges and a lot more.</p>
<p>Somehow, over the years, McGregor became a cradle for people with
unusual visions. Its bread and butter today, however, is sightseeing and
shopping.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Most of the antiques in northeast Iowa seem to have found their way to
McGregor's shops, and three weekends of craft festivals draw even more
shoppers.</p>
<p>And now a new breed of tourist is coming for the hiking, canoeing and
bird-watching at Effigy Mounds and in Yellow River State Forest. It's a
beautiful part of the state — and definitely not flat.</p>
