<h2>A scenic Mississippi River town is a magnet for day-trippers from the Twin Cities.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/e/red_wing_from_river2.jpg" alt="Barn Bluff frames Red Wing on the Mississippi." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Mississippi River, Barn Bluff frames Red Wing.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For many years, Red Wing has been Twin Citians' favorite day-trip
destination.</p>
<p>It's adorable, with its brick storefronts, flowering planters hung from
lampposts and rows of stately Victorian houses in three historic
districts.</p>
<p>Sitting on a sharp elbow of the Mississippi, it's a small town that
still looks the part — it has a bakery, a barber shop, a homespun café
— and it was the first Minnesota town on the National Trust for
Historic Preservation's list of Distinctive Destinations.</p>
<p>It looks good framed by the boxy green mound French explorers called
Mount La Grange, or barn mountain. From its flat top, hikers get a
spectacular view of the river winding north and Lake Pepin to the south.</p>
<p>In town, Levee and Bay Point parks provide a front-row seat for watching
the river action — towboats pushing barges, cruisers and fishing
boats, trains thundering past the slate-roofed depot.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's a lovely backdrop for what visitors like to do best in Red Wing —
wander. Especially in the fall, when leaf peepers are on the prowl.</p>
<p>Red Wing is ideally located for roaming. It's at the top of <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/driving-lake-pepin/">Lake
Pepin</a>, a wide spot in the Mississippi that is a 70-mile scenic drive,
especially in fall, when orchards and wineries showcase their goods.</p>
<p>It's surrounded by bluffs and is the eastern trailhead of the popular
19½-mile Cannon Valley Trail, which follows the Cannon River. And it's
barely 45 minutes from St. Paul.</p>
<p>For many years, Red Wing was a prime shopping destination. It's still
dedicated to collecting; Red Wing Stoneware, the blue-speckled crockery
first made in the town between 1877 and 1967, still draws crowds for the
Collectors Society convention in July.</p>
<p>Many artists work around Red Wing. In October, thousands of shoppers
come to the juried Fall Festival of Arts.</p>
<p>Pottery Place, the brick stoneware factory that was renovated in 1982,
still draws shoppers.</p>
<p>But most of the antiques and specialty stores are gone. Red Wing has
diversified: Today, it's known for bicycling, hiking, wineries, music
and eagle-watching as well as shopping.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/e/red_wing_mississippi_queen_wave.jpg" alt="People wave as the Mississippi Queen leaves Red Wing." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Mississippi excursion boats often stop in Red Wing.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's even a good place to bring children — big Colvill Park, on the
south end of town, has one of the region's best playgrounds and is the
eagle-watching hot spot in winter.</p>
<p>History always has been a draw. From the day the first eager
entrepreneur stepped off the dock, Red Wing has been the little town
that could.</p>
<p>Like other frontier boom towns, it rode the waves of prosperity; its
trick, however, was always bouncing back after the hard knocks.</p>
<p>Partly, it's due to a charmed location. For centuries before the white
settlers came, there was a thriving village in the shadow of Barn
Bluff.</p>
<p>It was a good place for the 300 Santee Dakota who lived there in bark
houses: scenic, fertile, on a water highway.</p>
<p>Of course, this also made it attractive to white settlers, who
eventually took it for themselves and named it for the local Dakota
chiefs, descended from an ancestor who used a dance fan made of a big
swan's wing, tinted with red ocher.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The fertile fields and river made the new town the largest primary grain
market in the world. But when the wheat centers moved west, other
industries developed — among them, leather and, from the abundant
local clay deposits, pottery.</p>
<p>Today, those industries have made a name for Red Wing that goes far
beyond regional boundaries. Starting in 1877, the crocks and jugs of Red
Wing Stoneware became fixtures in town and rural kitchens.</p>
<p>The big brick plant closed in 1967, but in 1982 it reopened as Pottery
Place, a shopping center.</p>
<p>In 1987, potter John Falconer bought the rights to the name Red Wing
Stoneware and began making the familiar crocks with speckled blue
Bristol glaze.</p>
<p>Why do people love them so much? Partly because they're so durable
&quot;you can take a nail and scratch the surface and see only a silver line
from the metal,&quot; said Falconer, who sold the company in 1998 and now
runs Falconer Vineyards in the bluffs near town.</p>
<p>All along, collectors have kept Red Wing a pottery capital, swelling its
population during the annual July convention.</p>
<p>Red Wing Shoes also has spread the red-wing logo throughout the world.
It's been growing since its founding in 1905, getting its customers and
employees through the Depression with a 99-cent shoe.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/e/red_wing_pottery_place.jpg" alt="Pottery Place in Red Wing." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The old Red Wing Pottery factory now is Pottery Place, a shopping mall.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Now, the company has a factory store and museum on Main Street that
features the World's Largest Boot, a size 638½ D made for the
company's 100th anniversary in 2005. This leather leviathan required 80
pounds of brass just for its eyelets.</p>
<p>Red Wing Shoes also was responsible for restoring the 1875 St. James
Hotel, which it bought in 1977, and it helped rejuvenate the Sheldon
Theatre, bequeathed to the city by one of its many tycoons in 1900 and
reopened with its original glitter in 1988.</p>
<p>But the tourists mostly come to Red Wing because it's so pretty. The
views are fabulous, not just from Barn Bluff but from Sorin's Bluff,
across from it, and even from such river-level spots as Bay Point Park,
where a village of houseboats rise and fall on old-fashioned gin poles.</p>
<p>Today, visitors, especially from the big city, consider Red Wing
small-town America at its best.</p>

is a good place to relax with a cold beer on a summer evening.</p>
<p>There are several places to eat in the St. James Hotel.</p>
<p><em>Bicycling</em> : There are two ways to reach the scenic, 19½-mile <a href="http://www.cannonvalleytrail.com/">Cannon
Valley Trail</a> to Cannon Falls. One
trailhead is off Old West Main Street just north of Pottery Place, and
one is 1½ miles north, off Minnesota 61 in Anderson Park. A daily Wheel
Pass, available at self-serve stations, is $4.</p>
<p><em>Hiking and views</em> : From downtown Red Wing, East Fifth Street leads
straight to the foot of Barn Bluff. The main path follows the north side
of the bluff, shady and cool on hot afternoons, and passes a vertical
rock face frequented by climbers.</p>
<p>At the other end of the bluff, steps lead to an overlook and a grassy
slope that faces town and is a popular spot to watch Fourth of July
fireworks.</p>
<p>A path atop the bluff leads through prairie to the southern overlook,
where it dead-ends; those who want to return on the sunny south face
have to return to the overlook before heading down.</p>
<p>For a really great lengthwise view of Barn Bluff, drive up Sorin's
Bluff, just across from it. You'll also get a good view of the High
Bridge, the town, the sharp elbow of the Mississippi and the Prairie
Island nuclear-power plant to the north.</p>
