<h2>Take in the views from 500 feet above the famous river.</h2>

At Effigy Mounds near Marquette, Iowa, the Fire Point Trail provides
spectacular views.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For centuries, blufftop views of the Mississippi have inspired
superlatives.</p>
<p>Jonathan Carver called the view from Barn Bluff &quot;the most beautiful
prospect that imagination can form.&quot; Stephen Long said, &quot;The sublime
and beautiful (are) here blended in the most enchanting manner.&quot;</p>
<p>Those early explorers embellished their speech to impress folks back
home. Nowadays, most people who take in the scenery just say &quot;Wow.&quot;</p>
<p>Breathtaking panoramas start in the Twin Cities gorge and continue to
Barn Bluff, a boxy mound that rises between Red Wing and the river.</p>
<p>From there, the Mississippi widens into Lake Pepin, which dissolves into
a tangle of sloughs and islands, marking  the 260-mile-long Upper
Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The stretch from Winona to the Rhine-like river valley of northeast Iowa
is perhaps the most beautiful part of the entire Mississippi River,
lined with rounded bluffs.</p>
<p>On many of them, people can get a bird's-eye view up and down the
valley.</p>
<p>Turkey vultures and pelicans fly by at eye level. But the church spires
and silos of civilization look tiny, like details in a diorama.</p>
<p>The world looks different, 500 feet up. Each view is well worth the
trouble to get there.</p>
<p>In fall, these panoramas are especially picturesque. Expect peak colors
to start in early October and work their way south. Here's a gallery of
a dozen great views between the Twin Cities and Dubuque.</p>
<h3>River gorge from end of Summit Avenue, <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/st-paul-sightseeing/">St. Paul</a></h3>
<p>Start your tour right in the middle of the urban area, on the only gorge
along the river's entire length. The best viewpoint on this heavily
wooded stretch, carved by the steady upstream march of St. Anthony
Falls, is at the end of Summit Avenue in St. Paul.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_paul_gorge_view.jpg" alt="A view up the Mississippi gorge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In St. Paul, an overlook on East River Parkway affords a view of the
Mississippi River gorge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Walk behind the World War I monument to a fenced overlook, then climb
down to a limestone ledge that juts over the bluff. From here, there's
an unobstructed view north toward downtown Minneapolis and south to the
Ford Parkway bridge.</p>
<p>Steep trails lead down to the river, where you can hunt for fossils or
watch rowers, canoeists and kayakers.</p>
<p>It's just south of the Lake Street/Marshall Avenue bridge, along East
River Parkway. There's a small parking area.</p>
<p>Another great Twin Cities overlook is <strong><a href="http://www.ci.stpaul.mn.us/facilities.aspx?pagenum=20&amp;RID=53&amp;Page=detail">Indian Mounds
Park</a></strong>
in St. Paul, on the bluff east of downtown. To get there, take the
Warner Road along the river and turn left on U.S. 61 and then Burns
Avenue. From I-94, take the Johnson Parkway exit south to Burns Avenue.</p>
<h3>Barn Bluff, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Red Wing, Minnesota</a></h3>
<p>French explorers called this boxy bluff Mount La Grange, or barn
mountain. From its flat top, 18th-century explorer Jonathan Carver said
he saw &quot;the most beautiful prospect that imagination can form.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/e/red_wing_barn_bluff2.jpg" alt="Hikers on Barn Bluff." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Hikers walk along the flat top of Barn Bluff in Red Wing.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It sits right in the path of the Mississippi, which had to make a sharp
turn to get around it.</p>
<p>The main path follows the north side of the 343-foot bluff, shady and
cool on hot afternoons, and passes a vertical rock face frequented by
climbers. At the north end of the bluff, there's an overlook and a
grassy slope that faces town.</p>
<p>From there, hikers can watch traffic crawl past the brick storefronts
and grain elevators of Red Wing and barges chug toward St. Paul. It's
also a popular spot to watch Fourth of July fireworks.</p>
<p>A path atop the bluff leads through prairie to the southern overlook,
where it dead-ends; those who want to return on the sunny south face
have to return to the overlook before heading down.</p>
<p>To get there, take East Fifth Street south from downtown Red Wing; it
leads straight to the foot of Barn Bluff.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/e/red_wing_sorins_bluff.jpg" alt="View from Sorin's Bluff in Red Wing." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The view from Sorin's Bluff includes Barn Bluff.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Sorin's Bluff in Memorial Park, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Red Wing</a></h3>
<p>For a really great lengthwise view of Barn Bluff, climb this
lesser-known bluff just across from it. You'll also get a good view of
the High Bridge, the town, the sharp elbow of the Mississippi and the
Prairie Island nuclear-power plant to the north.</p>
<p>This view is disabled-accessible; climb it by car from East Seventh
Street. Memorial Park includes round stone picnic tables, a disc-golf
course, mountain-bike trails and, in winter, four miles of challenging
ski trails.</p>
<h3>Frontenac State Park, on <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/driving-lake-pepin/">Lake Pepin</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/frontenac/index.html">Frontenac State
Park</a>
occupies a prominent point on the Mississippi, a well-known landmark for
steamboat captains.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>One overlook can be reached by car, but the steep, bluffside trails also
offer views — in the spring, of wildflowers and migrating songbirds,
as well as the river.From the nondescript town of Frontenac Station,
turn east off U.S. 61 and drive up to the state park.</p>
<p>If you have a minute, drive the other way through old Frontenac, on the
river. Founded in 1854 by the scions of an aristocratic Cincinnati
family, who had come up the Mississippi to hunt, it became Minnesota's
first resort area when Israel Garrard opened the Lake Side Hotel in
1865.</p>
<p>The general's 1854 St. Hubert's Lodge is still there, a French
Gallery-style house with a big, two-level veranda. It's the anchor of 
&quot;the Front Row,&quot; which includes Dacotah Cottage, built by his
brother Lewis in 1858; and the 1854 Locust Lodge, built for his business
partner.</p>
<p>Thanks to Israel Garrard, the railroad never came through quiet
Frontenac. To keep it away, he donated land two miles inland, and it was
built there.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/l/alma_view_spring.jpg" alt="The view from Buena Vista Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A couple take in the view from Buena Vista Park in Alma, Wis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Buena Vista Park, Alma, Wisconsin</h3>
<p>This wide-open limestone outcropping on the bluffs 500 feet above Alma
(pronounced EL-ma by locals)
provides a view of the river valley that's
nearly hypnotic.</p>
<p>There's a view of Lock and Dam 4, the town fishing float and the wide
river plain, broken by the channels and islands of the wildlife refuge.</p>
<p>The park is a two-mile drive from the south edge of town, which has just
two streets, a commercial stretch along the highway and a residential
area set into the steep bluff.</p>
<h3>Garvin Heights, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/winona-minnesota-fun/">Winona, Minnesota</a></h3>
<p>From the Garvin Heights overlook, 575 feet above the valley, there are
20-mile views up and down the river valley.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/winona_garvin_heights.jpg" alt="A Mississippi River view from Winona." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Winona lies at the foot of Garvin Heights.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Lake Winona is just below, and the town rolls toward the river, with its
collection of striking churches and commercial buildings; two sections
of downtown are National Historic Districts.</p>
<p>This view — actually, the view from the nearby Sugarloaf outcropping --
even impressed the notoriously unsentimental Lt. Zebulon Pike, who came
through in 1805 and called it &quot;a prospect so variegated and romantic
that a man may scarcely expect to enjoy such a one but twice or thrice
in the course of his life.&quot;</p>
<p>To get there, turn west off U.S. 61 onto Garvin Heights Road.</p>
<h3>Great River Bluffs State Park, south of <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/winona-minnesota-fun/">Winona</a></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/great_river_bluffs/index.html">Great River Bluffs State
Park</a>, 20 miles south of Winona, has perhaps the highest overlook on the
Upper Mississippi and is a great hiking destination, especially in
spring and fall.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/winona_great_bluffs.jpg" alt="View in Great Bluffs State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Great River Bluffs State Park treats hikers to many views.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The trail to King's Bluff provides views of the river valley as well as
Queen's Bluff, a state scientific and natural area that can be hiked
only with a permit. On the sun-baked sides of the bluffs, unusual plant
species flourish on goat prairies.</p>
<p>Shorter trails lead to other overlooks. According to river buff Duke
Addicks, writing in Big River magazine, the overlook off the picnic area
is the highest on the Upper Mississippi at 631 feet above the river.</p>
<p>If you're heading south on U.S. 61, take County Road 3, also Apple
Blossom Scenic Byway, to the park entrance.</p>
<p>If coming from the south, take Interstate 90 to County Road 12 south,
which connects to County Road 3 north.</p>
<h3>Brady's Bluff, <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Trempealeau, Wisconsin</a></h3>
<p>It takes some effort to reach the top of 520-foot Brady's Bluff, but
the view is magnificent.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/trempealeau_bradys_bluff.jpg" alt="The view from Brady's Bluff in Trempealeau." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From the top of Brady's Bluff, hikers can see as far north as Winona.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The towers and domes of Winona gleam 15 miles to the north, and just
below the bluff is little Trempealeau Mountain, which is ringed by the
river and was named by French explorers La Montagne Qui Trempe a l'Eau,
or, &quot;the mountain that soaks in the water.&quot;</p>
<p>It's also a bird-watching aerie. Upriver, the Trempealeau National
Wildlife Refuge draws flocks of migrating waterfowl; downriver, the Van
Loon State Wildlife Area bottomlands attract still more.</p>
<p>From Trempealeau, which sits right on the river, drive north into
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/perrot/">Perrot State Park</a> and take
one of three hiking trails to the bluff top.</p>
<p>In spring, Brady's Bluff is one of the region's best places to find
spring wildflowers, especially the jeweled shooting star.</p>
<h3>Grandad Bluff, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/lacrosse/">La Crosse, Wisconsin</a></h3>
<p>This windswept bluff, standing by itself on the east edge of La Crosse,
is impossible to miss.</p>
<p>It rises 590 feet above the sandy plain on which sits the town, named by
French traders for the ball game played by local Winnebago, or Ho Chunk,
and settled by early fur traders.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lacrosse_granddad_view.jpg" alt="The view from Granddad Bluff in La Crosse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the top of windswept Grandad Bluff, there's a guide to La Crosse
landmarks.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The sweeping views from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandad_Bluff">Grandad
Bluff</a> include the islands
and channels created by the Black and La Crosse rivers as they flow into
the Mississippi. On a plaque, landmarks are labeled, including the
bridges over the Mississippi.</p>
<p>To get there, drive across town along Main Street. A road winds around
the bluff and up, passing the Alpine Inn, where a blue neon sign hangs
in a window: &quot;Thanks for getting your duff up the bluff.&quot;</p>
<p>On top, there's a limestone pavilion with fireplaces, picnic tables and
a bathroom.</p>
<h3>Mount Hosmer City Park, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/lansing/">Lansing, Iowa</a></h3>
<p>This is one of the great views, and it has a great story to match.</p>
<p>In 1851, Lansing was just a cluster of cabins, one of many that served
passing steamboats. When one steamboat stopped to refuel, a 20-year-old
passenger named Harriet Hosmer challenged a purser to a footrace up the
steep bluff and won.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lansing_view.jpg" alt="The view from Mount Hosmer in Lansing." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The view from Mount Hosmer in Lansing.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Hosmer was a Massachusetts sculptor who had come west to study anatomy
after being denied admittance to medical schools in the East.</p>
<p>After her trip up the Mississippi River, she returned to the East and
then traveled to Rome, where she joined an international circle of
artists that included novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, who modeled one of
his characters after her.</p>
<p>Now, tourists trace her path up the 450-foot bluff, driving up hairpin
curves that seem almost vertical. The top is a park, with a playground,
picnic tables and pavilion.</p>
<p>The best view is from a pullout; sit on the retaining wall and take in a
three-state panorama, including Lansing's 1931 Black Hawk Bridge,
perhaps the loveliest on the Upper Mississippi.</p>
<p>To get to Mount Hosmer, drive up Main Street and turn right on Sixth
Street.</p>
<h3>Effigy Mounds National Monument, <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/great-river-road/northeast-Iowa-fall/">Marquette, Iowa</a></h3>
<p>High on the bluffs north of Marquette, this national park-service site
preserves 195 burial mounds left by an ancient people.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/o/iowa_hiker_effigy_mounds.jpg" alt="A hiker enjoys the view from Effigy Mounds in Iowa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Trails follow the blufftop at Effigy Mounds National Monument.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There are many mounds in the area. But these are remarkable because 31
are in the shapes of birds, reptiles and mammals, including the
137-foot-long Great Bear Mound.</p>
<p>In the visitors center, a film and exhibits show artifacts and explain
what is known about the three cultures that built the mounds between 500
B.C. and 1300.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nps.gov/efmo">Effigy Mounds National Monument</a> is a good
place to hike, especially in fall. There are 14 miles of hiking trails
on the heavily wooded bluffs, including two-mile Fire Point Trail, where
overlooks provide sweeping views of the river valley.</p>
<p>For more on fall in northeast Iowa, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/northeast-Iowa-fall/">One fall
swoop</a>.</p>
<h3>Pikes Peak State Park, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mcgregor-iowa/">McGregor, Iowa</a></h3>
<p>These 500-foot bluffs above McGregor caught the eye of <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/zebulon-pike/">Lt. Zebulon
Pike</a> in 1805, when
he was scouting for fort sites.</p>
<p>The fort instead was built across the river on the Prairie du Chien
flats, so Pike's aerie, now <a href="http://iowastateparks.reserveamerica.com/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=IA&amp;parkId=610141&amp;topTabIndex=CampingSpot">Pikes Peak State
Park</a>, was turned over to tourists.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pikes_peak_view_madeleine.jpg" alt="A little girl runs along a blufftop path in Pikes Peak State" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Pikes Peak State Park near McGregor, trails follow the top of a
500-foot bluff.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Its wide-open views of the river plain, from overlooks and 12 miles of
hiking trails that thread through ravines and forests, are mesmerizing.</p>
<p>Those who stand at its overlooks become voyeurs of life on the vast
river plain below, where trains inch across the water on bridges, barges
and houseboats lie at anchor and fishing boats putter into marshy
corners.</p>
<p>Admission is free, as it is to Iowa state parks. There's no interpretive
center, but there's a concession stand that sells snacks and postcards.</p>
<p>To get there, take County Road X56 into the bluffs.</p>
<h3>Wyalusing State Park, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/northeast-Iowa-fall/">Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin</a></h3>
<p>From the top of the 500-foot bluffs in <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/wyalusing/">Wyalusing State
Park</a>, just south of
Prairie du Chien, there's a splendid panorama that includes the islands
and sloughs around the mouth of the Wisconsin River.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/y/wyalusing_view_madeleine.jpg" alt="The view from Wyalusing State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Rock outcrops provide views in Wyalusing State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This is where Father Jacques Marquette and explorer Louis Joliet first
paddled onto the Mississippi River — the first Europeans to see it —
after traveling down the Wisconsin River from Green Bay in 1673.</p>
<p>Trails lead to overlooks and along effigy mounds left by ancient
Indians, especially along the Sentinel Ridge Trail, which also includes
a monument to the passenger pigeon.</p>
<p>Three shorter trails start from the campground, including the mile-long
Bluff Trail, which takes hikers past the ocher limestone of Treasure
Cave. The park also has eight miles of mountain-biking trails.</p>
<h3>Eagle Point Park, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/dubuque/">Dubuque, Iowa</a></h3>
<p>Dubuque, which is built on a series of hills, has many great views. One
of them is from old-fashioned <a href="http://www.cityofdubuque.org/573/Eagle-Point-Park">Eagle Point
Park</a>, just north of
downtown and overlooking Lock and Dam 11.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/dubuque_eagle_point_park_view.jpg" alt="a family walks along Eagle Point Park in Dubuque" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Dubuque is full of great views, including this one from Eagle Point
Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was happy result of civil pride, wounded in 1907 with an East Coast
parks expert visited and declared, &quot;I have never seen a place where the
Almighty has done more and mankind less, than Dubuque.&quot;</p>
<p>Judge Oliver Shiras spearheaded the drive to create a park, and Eagle
Point opened in 1909, with overlooks, picnic areas and gardens. In the
1930s, beautiful Prairie-style pavilions were added by WPA crews.</p>
<p>For a good view of downtown Dubuque, which includes many church
steeples, the gold-leaf dome of the courthouse and the bridge, ride the
<a href="http://www.fenelonplaceelevator.com/">Fenelon Place</a> funicular to the
bluff above downtown.</p>
<p>For more river-valley views, hike the trails of the <a href="http://www.minesofspain.org/">Mines of Spain
State Recreation Area</a> south of town.</p>
