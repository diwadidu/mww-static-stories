<h2>These days, the riverfront is an even bigger draw than the bars.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/la_crosse_mississippi_queen.jpg" alt="Mississippi Queen in La Crosse Wisconsin." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>We'd been in La Crosse for barely an hour, and everyone we'd met was a
certified character.</p>
<p>In Riverside Park, Frank and Faith Rimmert and Jonathan and Barb Rimmert
were decked out in top hats, waistcoats and crinolines to meet the
Mississippi Queen paddlewheeler, portraying the 19th-century locals who
would have assembled.</p>
<p>&quot;If your relatives were coming for a visit, you'd come to greet
them,&quot; said Faith Rimmert, a volunteer for the La Crosse County
Historical Society. &quot;People picked up things being shipped in, or maybe
you'd be looking for a servant — you'd say, 'I want that person for
a servant in my house.'&quot;</p>
<p>As the history buffs smiled for the camera, a wedding party in black
dresses, black fishnet stockings and purple ankle boots hurried toward
their own photo session in a gazebo.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then, a lime-green 1953 fire truck full of German shepherds drew up,
blasting its horn. It was Charles Weeth of La Crosse Skyrockers, a
volunteer group that puts on special effects and fireworks shows at city
festivals.</p>
<p>&quot;I can do a hundred effects off this thing,&quot; he said. &quot;I've got
really loud whistles that set off a fountain of silver sparks and one
that goes whoosh in a great ball of fire. Oh, we have a lot of fun
here.&quot;</p>
<p>He invited us to hop in and said he was still recovering from
Oktoberfest, which had ended six days before. When I asked if it was
true the festival had become more sedate in recent years, he had to
think about it for a while.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, there aren't the riots and tear gas and all,&quot; he said. &quot;But
you know how it is when alcohol and testosterone and estrogen get all
tied together.&quot;</p>
<p>La Crosse always has been a destination for drinkers, with as many as
eight breweries, three colleges and a downtown with so many consecutive
bars it once held a Guinness world record.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/la_crosse_carriage.jpg" alt="A carriage in La Crosse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Not long ago, a reputation was nearly all La Crosse had. Damage from a
1965 flood forced the city to demolish many historic buildings, turning
the riverfront into an empty patch of sand.</p>
<p>A new mall off the interstate drew business from downtown, and the big
department stores closed. Even its status as a drinking town took a hit
in 1999, when its last brewery closed briefly.</p>
<p>But downtown La Crosse is looking spruced up these days, with new brick
pavers and period street lamps. The brewery is back, partly owned by
employees and renamed City Brewery for its 1858 origins.</p>
<p>And there's a microbrewery in North La Crosse, where the Pearl Street
Brewery produces a line of signature ales as well as handcrafted
seasonal and specialty beers.</p>
<p>The sand patch now is a verdant park surrounded by hotels. The giant
Mississippi Queen stops there to let passengers go sightseeing, evoking
the era of Mark Twain, who got off a boat in 1882 and pronounced La
Crosse &quot;a choice town.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Named for a game</h3>
<p>We were there during Historic Downtown La Crosse Days, so we joined a
tour led by architectural historian Barbara Kooiman.</p>
<p>The town is named for the game French traders saw the local Ho-Chunk
playing; the first resident set up a fur post to trade with them, and by
the time Twain arrived, La Crosse was a thriving rail and river center
with nearly two dozen lumber mills.</p>
<p>Some of the downtown he saw — &quot;blocks of buildings, which are stately
enough, and also architecturally fine enough, to command respect on any
city&quot; — is still there.</p>
<p>The 1879 Italianate Pamperin Cigar Co. is there, still with original
copper panels under its windows, as well as the 1872 Healy Block, where
Dr. Frank &quot;White Beaver&quot; Powell ran a drugstore, and the 1878 John
Walter Building, now with a 1933 Art Moderne facade.</p>
<p>&quot;We have quite a gem here,&quot; Kooiman said. &quot;People talk about all the
buildings torn down, but we have a nice concentration here.&quot;</p>
<p>As we walked farther from the river, the buildings became newer with
each block, until we reached the Prairie School Odin J. Oyen Building,
built in 1912 for an interior designer, and the 1930 art-deco Hoeschler
Building, with sconces and mosaic panels.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/la_crosse_sixpack.jpg" alt="The world's largest six-pack in La Crosse, Wis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;That's what's neat about La Crosse,&quot; Kooiman said. &quot;As you
progress away from the river, the styles shift with each decade.&quot;</p>
<p>Behind the historic facades that day, costumed characters were
portraying Oyen, Frank Powell and Dr. Adolph Gundersen, who founded the
local hospital. John Satory, a former president of the historical
society, has played Powell and merchant Mons Anderson.</p>
<p>But this year, he was behind the counter of his Satori Arts shop on
Pearl Street.</p>
<p>On a shelf over his head sat boxes of products once made in La Crosse</p>
<ul>
<li>Jay-Tee Japan Green Tea, Peerless Beer and Funk's Happy Boy
Confections, made on the site of town founder Nathan Myrick's cabin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another case held Doc Powell memorabilia, including a ruler stamped
&quot;White Beaver's Cough Cream and Wonder Worker,&quot; which Powell marketed
with his friend William &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody, who often came to visit.</p>
<p>Powell was a medical-college graduate, and his mother was part Seneca,
known as a medicine chief, Satory said. &quot;He believed in herbal
medicines, so people thought he was a quack.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lacrosse_granddad_bluff_view.jpg" alt="The view of La Crosse from Granddad Bluff." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
For a great view of the city, drive up to Grandad Bluff.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the sidewalk outside the shop, people lounged in the sun, eating
ice-cream cones from an old-time parlor. Overhead, painted ladies looked
on from murals on the boarded-up windows of the 1887 Schwartz Block,
once a disreputable hotel.</p>
<p>&quot;This neck of the woods was really a bad part of town,&quot; Satory said.
&quot;They used to arrest GIs if they were found in the area.&quot;</p>
<h3>A brew or two</h3>
<p>We couldn't leave town without seeing the World's Largest Six Pack at
City Brewery. When it was Heileman, the only La Crosse brewery to
survive Prohibition, the giant storage cylinders bore the Old Style
logo; today, they look like cans of La Crosse Lager.</p>
<p>The last time I visited, our tour guide told us that students once tried
to tap the cans with an ax, nearly blowing up the neighborhood.</p>
<p>A second guide said he hadn't heard that story, but he offered a stupid
drinking trick of his own: One Oktoberfest, he said, some men sawed the
stein out of the hand of King Gambrinus, the potbellied medieval
connoisseur whose wooden statue stands outside the brewery.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They used it to drink beer during the festival, then returned it to the
king.</p>
<p>In La Crosse, drinking legends are legion, many revolving around the
brewery, which once offered unlimited imbibing before and after tours.</p>
<p>Back downtown, we stopped by the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Casino-Bar/74272200673">Casino</a>, a
former speakeasy whose Art Moderne interior Barbara Kooiman had urged us
to see.</p>
<p>Run for more than 30 years by the late Donald Padesky, who refused to
sell big-brewery American lagers, the bar now specializes in cocktails
as well as good beer and is on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>Outside the Pearl Street bar, people still were sitting at sidewalk
tables, enjoying the evening and drinking — except they were drinking
coffee, not beer.</p>
<p>Maybe we left too early, or maybe La Crosse has calmed down even more
than we thought. But no matter what, it'll always have its reputation.</p>
