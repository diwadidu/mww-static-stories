<h2>A once-shabby Mississippi River town now is a tourists' playground.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/dubuque_view_bridge.jpg" alt="Steeples and bridges dominate the view of Dubuque." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Church steeples and bridges dominate the views from Dubuque's

<p>For much of its existence, Dubuque, Iowa, has been a little short on
charisma.</p>
<p>It started out well, with a lead-mining boom and eight breweries and
Victorian mansions filled with millionaires.</p>
<p>But it faded into obscurity. For years, its last brewery sat empty next
to the 1856 Shot Tower, where laborers once turned molten lead into
bullets and cannonballs by dropping it through screens into cool river
water.</p>
<p>Dubuque does have Iowa's three oldest churches, its three oldest
colleges and its only courthouse with a gold-leaf dome. It still has its
historic mansions and spectacular cityscape views from the world's
shortest and steepest railway.</p>
<p>But to many tourists, Dubuque is a Peoria, a synonym for stodgy middle
America. They'd rather drive across the river to shop in Galena, or see
the famous &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; site in nearby Dyersville.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But Dubuque is a backwater no longer. These days, it's calling itself
&quot;Masterpiece on the Mississippi.&quot;</p>
<p>Just as in Minnesota's port city of Duluth, people were raring to get
at the water. In Dubuque, there was already a riverboat casino moored in
the Ice Harbor, and a riverboat museum.</p>
<p>But there was no place for people to hang out on the riverfront,
strolling along and watching the towboats and paddlewheelers go by.</p>
<p>They got that and more.</p>
<p>Borrowing the most famous line from &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; — &quot;If you
build it, they will come&quot; — a city-sponsored partnership brought in
a riverfront resort and water park, a national river museum and aquarium
and a handsome glass-and-stone events center.</p>
<p>The Riverwalk, paved in pink and cream stone, connects them all.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/dubuque_fenelon_horizontal.jpg" alt="The Fenelon cable railway in Dubuque." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Fenelon Place funicular climbs a 65-degree grade.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From the Ice Harbor and a plaza where the Mississippi Queen and her
sisters dock, the path follows the river-edge dike to an amphitheater in
front of the ornate 1899 Dubuque Star Brewing Co., which now houses
Stone Cliff Winery and Tasting Room.</p>
<p>Dubuque isn't so stodgy anymore. And sure enough, the people are
coming.</p>
<p>Dubuque always has been blessed geographically. When my son and I were
driving to the top of the Fenelon Place Elevator on a September trip, he
looked around and said, &quot;Geez, I feel like we're in San Francisco.&quot;</p>
<p>On the side of a wooded bluff, two little rail cars run up and down, the
legacy of a banker who, in 1882, decided he needed a faster way to get
home for his noontime meal and nap.</p>
<p>Today, the little cars pulls tourists up a 65-percent grade toward a
magnificent view of Wisconsin, Illinois, the river valley and the
steepled downtown, surrounded by hills thick with Victorian manses.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;They call this little Rome, because it's built on seven hills, like
Rome, Italy,&quot; said the cable-car operator, who said he used the cars
himself to deliver newspapers when he was a boy.</p>
<p>Far below, we could see a paddlewheeler pulling out of the Ice Harbor
for its dinner cruise. Speedboats carved white wakes on the river, and
cars streamed across the elegant Julien Dubuque Bridge.</p>
<p>We watched, mesmerized, as the last rays of sunlight lit up the gold
dome of the 1891 courthouse and the white spires and turrets of
churches; the heavily Catholic town of 58,000 is famed for its large
numbers of churches and even greater proportion of taverns.</p>
<p>Dubuque's neighborhoods, lined with sturdy brick storefronts, have an
uncanny 1950s quality and have been used in movies, filling in for
blue-collar Boston in &quot;Field of Dreams.&quot;</p>
<p>Since 2016, though, they've looked a little different: Nearly 40
beautiful murals have been painted on historic on brick buildings,
thanks to a volunteer arts organization.</p>
<p>Change is particularly striking along the riverfront.</p>

<p>When we got to the seven-story Grand Harbor Resort, families were
arriving loaded with coolers and bags of snacks, as if for a slumber
party.</p>
<p>In the 25,000-square-foot indoor water park, children were flocking to a
deejay who was conducting hula-hoop competitions and trivia contests,
complete with microphones for contestants and neon digital scores.</p>
<p>The resort is pretty classy, and not just for Dubuque. Its staff
includes friendly concierge/porters, and when we asked about trolley
tours, one gave us the cell-phone number of the operator and told us to
call for a pick-up right in front of the hotel.</p>
<p>That's what we did the next day, touring the city in the drizzle with a
driver who filled us in on the town's fortunes since the 1788 arrival of
Quebecois fur-trader Julien Du Buque.</p>
<p>Du Buque mined lead with the permission of the Mesquakie, under the
aegis of Spain, until his death in 1810.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Settlers came in the aftermath of the ugly Black Hawk War, and Missouri
farm boy Mathias Ham began pulling millions of dollars in lead ore from
the earth.</p>
<p>After the Civil War, mining slowed and the big fortunes were made by
lumber barons - Henry Stout, king of the Wisconsin pineries - and
such entrepreneurs as A.A. Cooper, whose covered wagons carried pioneers
over the Oregon Trail.</p>
<p>We got off the trolley at the National Mississippi River Museum &amp;
Aquarium, on the Ice Harbor. It's on the site of the Dubuque Boat &amp;
Boiler Works, founded as the Iowa Iron Works in 1851 and once the
nation's largest shipbuilder on inland waters. It closed in 1972.</p>
<p>The museum is quite a place. In its movie theaters, we watched towboats
push barges through locks and Ojibwe bend stalks of wild rice into
canoes. We listened to delta blues and zydeco and felt vibrations from
the New Madrid earthquake of 1811.</p>
<p>In the virtual pilothouse of a towboat, we watched fellow tourists smack
their barges into a bridge pier, despite having been warned it takes a
tow a mile and a half to stop even at 9 mph.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/dubuque_riverboat.jpg" alt="A paddlewheeler leaves the harbor in Dubuque." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We stood at the erosion table and pushed buttons to make rain fall and
rivers flow faster. Kids especially love the waist-high table, on which
tiny farms and houses sit atop sand plateaus, sometimes falling to
floods or erosion.</p>
<p>In the bayou aquarium, an alligator draped itself over the prow of a
wrecked rowboat, and a giant snapping turtle waved its fleshy yellow
legs, skin as thick and wrinkled as an elephant's.</p>
<p>Many river denizens are amazingly prehistoric-looking; in another
aquarium, beady-eyed paddlefish swam alongside shovelnose sturgeon and
longnose gar.</p>
<p>Our favorite spot was the River Wetlab, which made me feel like a kid
again, fooling around in a creek.</p>
<p>We held mussels, watched crayfish poke themselves in the eye and touched
hard pink clumps midway up the stalk of a cattail — real snail eggs.</p>
<p>As it turns out, an afternoon is not long enough to see everything at
the National River Museum.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/dubuque_eagle_point_park_view.jpg" alt="a family walks along Eagle Point Park in Dubuque" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Dubuque is full of great views, including this one from Eagle Point
Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We had to make a quick tour of the older riverboat museum, which had a
nifty 1/8-scale model of the third Dubuque steamboat and a life-size
Marquette and Joliet in a canoe and a clammer in a johnboat filled with
mussels.</p>
<p>Out back, we walked past the otter tank to the wetland, filled with
ducks, and past a wigwam to the 1934 William Black, a steam-powered
dredge.</p>
<p>The next morning, the sun had returned. Looking out our window, I saw
the Robin B. Ingram pushing its cargo upriver through the railroad swing
bridge, soon followed by the Penny Eckstein. Soon the Riverwalk filled
with boat-watchers, dog-walkers and Sunday strollers.</p>
<p>It's odd that most cities along working rivers have ignored their
waterfronts for so long. Because when they can, the people come.</p>
