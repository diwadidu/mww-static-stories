<h2>dd</h2>
<p>FRONTENAC/An oasis of old-fashioned gentility</p>
<p>Perhaps nowhere in Minnesota are the 1850s preserved as perfectly as they are in Old Frontenac.</p>
<p>That was when entrepreneurs were swarming up the Mississippi, eager to make money. But in 1854, Israel and Lewis Garrard, scions of an aristocratic Cincinnati family, came to hunt.</p>
<p>They got no further than Lake Pepin, where the river widens. Struck by the beauty of a point on its western banks, they stopped, bought land from an Indian trader and lived as country gentlemen while the frontier grew up around them.</p>
<p>When the Civil War started, Israel went back to Ohio and fought for the Union. When he came back, he was a general and had a renewed appreciation for tranquility.</p>
<p>When development came too close to the quiet point, he rebuffed it: In the 1870s, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul wanted to go through the riverside settlement � to anyone else, an economic windfall � but Israel made the railroad lay its tracks two miles away.</p>
<p>Thanks to him, Old Frontenac still is the most peaceful spot on either side of this scenic stretch of river, the only settlement besides Wabasha that is not bisected by a highway or rail line.</p>
<p>And yet, few of the tourists who whiz by on Minnesota 61, past the nondescript town of Frontenac Station, even know it�s there. Which is just the way the old general would have wanted it.</p>
<p>If visitors turn off 61 and drive the two miles to the river, they�ll see a village that is remarkably unchanged since his days. On a terrace overlooking the river, on park-like grounds, stand Southern-style white-frame manors with long verandas.</p>
<p>Behind them, along narrow gravel lanes, are smaller houses, many once occupied by the German-immigrant workers that Israel Garrard brought from Cincinnati, whose town site his grandfather once owned.</p>
<p>The general's 1855 St. Hubert's Lodge, named after the patron saint of hunting, became the hub of a genteel resort; novelist Harriet Beecher Stowe and actress Marie Dressler were among his guests.</p>
<p>Below, on the oak-shaded point, he turned an 1859 grain warehouse into the Lake Side Hotel, opened in 1865.</p>
<p>It drew well-heeled vacationers from New Orleans, Memphis and St. Louis and made Frontenac Minnesota�s first resort, a stop on what frontier artist George Catlin promoted as &quot;The Fashionable Tour.��</p>
<p>In 1881, the American Travellers Journal called Frontenac &quot;the Newport of the Northwest.��</p>
<p>The society traffic faded when railroads supplanted steamboats in the 1880s, but the hotel operated as the Frontenac Inn from 1907 until 1939, when the Methodist Church bought it and adjoining cottages and used them as a retreat until 1987.</p>
<p>After that, the point was quiet. It's still quiet, but ordinary visitors once again can partake of Frontenac's tranquility. Local cabin owners Linda and Bill Flies bought the church retreat on the point and made a 1941 dorm into a classy B&amp;B, part of a Chateau Frontenac complex that will include a renovated hotel and cottages, all white with green shutters, like the manors on the terrace above.</p>
<p>Israel Garrard's house also is a B&amp;B. Lovingly maintained by local resident Priscilla Flynn, it still contains much of Garrard's furniture and library.</p>
<p>The French Gallery-style house, with a big, two-level veranda across its front, is the anchor of &quot;the Front Row,'' which includes Dacotah Cottage, built by Lewis in 1858; Winona, built in 1889 for Israel�s son George, with a stone wall added in 1905; and the 1854 Locust Lodge, built for Evert Westervelt, Israel's original partner.</p>
<p>Israel and his family were the only Garrards to stay in Frontenac for good. Three other brothers came and went: Lewis, who was the town doctor for many years; Kenner, a much-decorated Army officer; and Jeptha, a lawyer who lived at the hotel for a time in the 1890s while he tested a flying machine.</p>
<p>Jeptha�s experiments, in which he sent his airship and a hired parachute jumper on a track down the steep face of Point No Point and over Lake Pepin, provided entertainment for summer visitors, who called the hired pilot &quot;The Victim.��</p>
<p>There's not much to do in Frontenac, besides strolling and watching traffic pass the point: barges, trains rumbling at the foot of the Wisconsin bluffs, yachts from Lake City�s marina. In summer, three passing Queens � Delta, American and Mississippi � evoke the steamboat era.</p>
<p>Frontenac State Park is next door; it's known for its overlooks, displays of spring wildflowers and bird-watching, especially during the warbler migration in May.</p>
<p>But the world at large comes only up to Frontenac�s fringes. And that's the way Israel Garrard always wanted it.</p>
