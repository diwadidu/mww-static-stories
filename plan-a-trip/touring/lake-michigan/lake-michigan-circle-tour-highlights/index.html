<p>Smack in the middle of the Upper Midwest, Lake Michigan is irresistible
in summer.</p>
<p>It's America's freshwater Riviera, and everyone competes for a little
piece of that beautiful sand: beach bums, lighthouse buffs, campers on a
budget.</p>
<p>A road trip around its shores is one of the world's most scenic drives,
a thousand miles of lakeshore lined by state, county and national parks</p>
<ul>
<li>and two big cities.</li>
</ul>
<p>But it's tricky to plan a Circle Tour of Lake Michigan. What to see,
what to do, where to stay? If you wait till the last minute, you may not
find a place.</p>
<p>Here's a nine-day, eight-night Circle Tour of Lake Michigan that takes
in the highlights.</p>
<p>Start planning as far in advance as possible — six months if you're
planning to camp on weekends in Michigan beach parks, 11 months in
Wisconsin parks.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/camping-lake-michigan/">Camping around Lake
Michigan</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Plan up to a year in advance if you want to stay anywhere on holiday or
festival weekends in a beach town or in one of the many state-park
cabins.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/michigan-state-park-cabins/">Michigan's great lake
cabins</a>.</p>
<p>For an overview of what you'll see, go to <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/circle-tour-lake-michigan/">Circling Lake
Michigan</a>.</p>
<p>For half a Circle Tour, with a short cut by ferry, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-tour/">Lake Michigan
with kids</a>.</p>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-circle-tour-lake-michigan/">Planning a Circle Tour of Lake
Michigan</a>, which lists the biggest festivals.</p>
<p>The shoreline is 1,640 miles long, but it's about 1,100 miles by car,
or less if you want to skip one of the four largest peninsulas - the
Door in Wisconsin, the Garden in the Upper Peninsula and the Mission and
Leelanau in Lower Michigan.</p>
<p>Since you have to start somewhere, we start in Green Bay.</p>
<h3><em>Green Bay to the Straits of Mackinac, 255 miles</em></h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/r/cross_village_legs.jpg" alt="Legs Inn in Cross Village." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Cross Village, the historic Legs Inn serves Polish food and beer.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Get an early start if you want to see the best attractions along this
stretch, mostly along U.S. 2 through the Upper Peninsula.</p>
<p>Less than an hour from <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/green-bay-kids/"><strong>Green
Bay</strong></a>,
you'll come to the <a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/history-heritage/peshtigo-fire-museum-203446">Fire
Museum</a>
in Peshtigo, where more than 1,000 people died in an 1871 forest fire
that largely was overlooked because the Great Chicago Fire happened the
same day.</p>
<p>Half an hour east of the Wisconsin-Michigan border, take a break on the
lovely beach at J.W. Wells State Park. In Escanaba, see the 1868 Sand
Point Lighthouse.</p>
<p>At this point, it's possible to head north on U.S. 41 for a detour to
Marquette or Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, stops on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/lake-superior-circle-tour-highlights/">Lake
Superior Circle Tour</a>.</p>
<p>Continuing east on U.S. 2, two unusual sites are worth a short detour.
On the Garden Peninsula, the intact but abandoned <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/fayettetownsite">Fayette Historic
Townsite</a> was a boom town in
the 1880s, when its giant furnaces smelted ore into iron, then shipped
it to the big cities.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>As soon as you're back on U.S. 2, it'll be time to turn off for
<a href="http://www.visitmanistique.com/bigspring.shtml">Kitch-iti-kipi Spring</a>, where you'll get onto a raft and propel yourself across the spring to
watch water bubbling from deep within the earth, like an underground
volcano.</p>
<p>On the Straits of Mackinac, either spend the night in <a href="http://www.stignace.com/">St.
Ignace</a>, take the ferry to Mackinac Island or
cross the Mackinac Bridge to spend the night in <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/mackinaw-city-colonial-michilimackinac/">Mackinaw
City</a>.</p>
<p>It's expensive to stay on the island, but it's worth it if you get up
early to enjoy the quiet before day-trippers arrive.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/best-sights-mackinac-island/">Mackinac Island</a>, a short ferry ride</h3>
<p>This fabled island really is spectacular. Get away from its
fudge-infested main street as soon as possible to tour Fort Mackinac and
bluffs lined by magnificent Golden Age &quot;cottages.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/ludington_big_sable.jpg" alt="Big Sable Point Lighthouse near Ludington." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Tourists can climb the 1867 Big Sable Point Lighthouse in Ludington
State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Bicycles are the best way to see this car-free island. Bring or rent one
to circle it on the eight-mile Lake Shore Road and cross its rounded
hump-he Ojibwe called it Michilimackinac, land of the great turtle,
for the way its interior rises from the lake.</p>
<p>You'll see famous Arch Rock, the Sugar Loaf, the ruins of Fort Holmes,
nature trails and carpets of wildflowers.</p>
<h3><em>Mackinaw City to Traverse City, 106 miles</em></h3>
<p>Many people give short shrift to <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/mackinaw-city-colonial-michilimackinac/"><strong>Mackinaw
City</strong></a>, but that's where you'll find one of the lake's biggest family
attractions: Colonial Michilimackinac, a fur-trade post staffed by
interpreters who portray the year 1775, when the British controlled it.</p>
<p>If you also plan to go to Fort Mackinac on Mackinac Island, buy a Triple
Choice Ticket and visit Colonial Michilimackinac and also Old Mackinac
Point Lighthouse or Historic Mill Creek Discovery Park, which includes a
425-foot zip line and 50-foot-high forest canopy bridge.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinac_arch_rock2.jpg" alt="Arch Rock on Mackinac Island." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Mackinac Island, tourists visit Arch Rock by foot, bicycle or
horse-drawn wagon.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From Mackinaw City, drive west to Cross Village and have a meal at the
<a href="http://www.legsinn.com/">Legs Inn</a>, whose fieldstone façade is lined
with white stove legs. Founded by a Polish immigrant in 1921, it
combines Old World traditions with a quirky outsider-art aesthetic.</p>
<p>From Cross Village, the <a href="https://www.michigan.org/article/road-trip/stops-scenic-road-trip-along-m-119-and-tunnel-trees">Tunnel of
Trees</a>
follows the Lake Michigan shoreline to the old-money enclave of Harbor
Springs and the resort town of Petoskey.</p>
<p>In pleasant Charlevoix, take a stroll along the canal that connects Lake
Michigan to big Lake Charlevoix and see the stone &quot; <a href="https://www.visitcharlevoix.com/Earl-Young_">mushroom
houses</a> &quot; designed and
built by local resident Earl Young. You can even <a href="https://www.mushroomhouses.com/">rent
one</a> if you want.</p>
<h3><em>Traverse City to Empire via</em> <em>the Leelanau Peninsula</em> <em>, 85 miles</em></h3>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/"><strong>Traverse
City</strong></a>
has an enviable spot at the foot of Grand Traverse Bay and two long
peninsulas. Swim from its beaches, bicycle the TART Trail, shop and eat
in its appealing downtown or take a cruise on the tall ship
<a href="http://www.tallshipsailing.com/manitou/">Manitou</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/a/fayette_ruins2.jpg" alt="Ruins at Historic Fayette Townsite." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The town of Fayette was a boom town in the 1880s.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you love lighthouses (and wineries), travel to the tip of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/old-mission-peninsula-michigan-spring/">Old
Mission
Peninsula</a>
to see the Old Mission Point Lighthouse or up the Leelanau Peninsula to
<a href="https://www.grandtraverselighthouse.com/">Grand Traverse Lighthouse</a>.
You can stay there as a <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/volunteer-lighthouse-keepers/">volunteer
keeper</a>, and also at other lighthouses around the lake.</p>
<p>Then continue on to <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/sleeping-bear-dunes/"><strong>Sleeping Bear Dunes National
Lakeshore</strong></a>, the one
<em>required</em> stop on the Lake Michigan Circle Tour.</p>
<h3><em>Empire to Holland, 184 miles</em></h3>
<p>Get up early to play in the giant sandbox of Sleeping Bear Dunes. Do the
Dune Climb, swim from the beaches, hike the Empire Bluff trail and tube
down the Platte River.</p>
<p>Continue down the lake to Ludington State Park, where you can swim from
the beach, tube down the Sable River and walk or bike to the 1867 Big
Sable Point Lighthouse, which you can climb.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Just south of Ludington, you can go on a motorized dune ride over the
<a href="https://www.michigan.org/article/trip-idea/things-do-silver-lake-sand-dunes-ultimate-pure-michigan-guide">Silver Lake Sand
Dunes</a>. Then continue to the Dutch town of <a href="http://holland.org/">Holland</a> and
its beloved Big Red lighthouse on the beach. For a great beer, check out
<a href="https://www.newhollandbrew.com/">New Holland Brewing</a>.</p>
<h3>Holland to New Buffalo, 82 miles</h3>
<p>Spend part of the morning on the expansive beach of Holland State Park.</p>
<p>Now you're in serious tourist land, and the next stretch is thick with
fun little beach towns, each a worthy destination in itself.</p>
<p>In Saugatuck, browse the shops, and if you have time, visit <a href="https://saugatuck.com/business-listings/oval-beach/">Oval
Beach</a> via
hand-cranked chain ferry across the Kalamazoo River.</p>
<p>In South Haven, take a ride on the <a href="https://www.michiganmaritimemuseum.org/plan-your-visit/on-water-experiences/">Friends Good
Will</a>, a replica of an 1810 square-topsail sloop that's berthed at the
<a href="https://www.michiganmaritimemuseum.org/">Michigan Maritime Museum</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/warren_dunes_sandcastles.jpg" alt="A sand castle at Warren Dunes." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Sand castles line the beach at Warren Dunes State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In St. Joseph, ride the <a href="https://www.silverbeachcarousel.com/">carousel</a>
and swim from <a href="https://berriencounty.org/1295/Silver-Beach-County-Park">Silver
Beach</a>. Near
Sawyer, walk the dunes of <a href="https://www2.dnr.state.mi.us/ParksandTrails/Details.aspx?id=504&amp;type=SPRK">Warren Dunes State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>Then follow the old Red Arrow Highway to <a href="http://www.newbuffalo.org/">New
Buffalo</a> and its festive beach.</p>
<p>Each of these beach towns between <a href="https://www.michiganbeachtowns.com/blog/cheers-your-way-across-the-beachtowns-craft-beverage-trail/">Muskegon and South
Haven</a>
has its own craft brewery, as do the towns between <a href="https://swmichigan.org/makers">Benton Harbor and
New Buffalo</a>.</p>
<h3><em>New Buffalo to Racine, 145 miles</em></h3>
<p>New Buffalo is the last beach town before Indiana and <a href="http://www.nps.gov/indu/index.htm">Indiana Dunes
National Park</a>, whose scattered,
non-contiguous parts will puzzle many visitors.</p>
<p>West Beach, the closest to Chicago, is the easiest national-park beach
to get into. It's lovely, though flanked by steel mills.</p>
<p>You won't want to spend any time in Gary. And you won't have time to
fight your way through the Chicago suburbs to the city's lakefront,
which is lined by gorgeous beaches.</p>
<p>So <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/">save Chicago for another
trip</a>
and keep on driving to the Wisconsin border, where you'll reconnect
with Lake Michigan at <a href="https://www.visitkenosha.com/">Kenosha</a>.
There's a beautiful sand beach and a whole bevy of lighthouses here,
along the harbor and up on the hill above downtown.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/e/kenosha_lighthouses.jpg" alt="Lighthouse in Kenosha." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Two pierhead lights mark the harbor in downtown Kenosha.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Continue to Racine, which also has a lovely beach. A bike trail connects
<a href="http://www.racine.org/north_beach.html">North Beach</a> to the Racine Zoo
and downtown.</p>
<h3><em>Racine to Two Rivers, 120 miles</em></h3>
<p>In
<a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/wright-buildings-racine-wisconsin/"><strong>Racine</strong></a>, take a free tour of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed SC Johnson
complex.</p>
<p>On the north end of town, stop to see the classic 1880 <a href="http://windpointlighthouse.org/">Wind Point
Lighthouse</a>, one of the tallest on the
Great Lakes. If you're there on the first Sunday of the month from June
through October, you can tour it.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/milwaukee/"><strong>Milwaukee</strong></a> is a destination in
itself, but you'll have time to cruise along its beautiful lakefront.
If you're there by noon, you'll get to see the &quot;wings&quot; of the
Milwaukee Art Museum close and open.</p>
<p>Plan ahead and you can take a day sail on the three-masted schooner
<a href="https://www.discoveryworld.org/things-to-do/exhibits/sailing-vessel-denis-sullivan/">Denis
Sullivan</a>
from <a href="http://www.discoveryworld.org/">Discovery World</a>. Or <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/milwaukee-brewery-tours/">tour a
brewery</a>.</p>
<p>Port Washington has a marina and a lighthouse on the hill.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/m/empire_platte_mouth.jpg" alt="Playing on the Platte River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Platte River empties in Lake Michigan south of Empire.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/sheboygan-wisconsin/"><strong>Sheboygan</strong></a> has a lovely beach and the
remains of a shipwreck at Deland Park. Just up the hill, its John
Michael Kohler Arts Center has a blockbuster collection of  outsider
art, and admission is free.</p>
<p>In Manitowoc, stop at the Wisconsin Maritime Museum to tour the U.S.S.
Cobia submarine. If you plan ahead, you can even <a href="http://www.wisconsinmaritime.org/learning-programs/overnight-programs/family-overnights/">stay there
overnight</a></p>
<ul>
<li>yes, in the submarine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paved Mariners Trail follows the lakeshore and connects Manitowoc to
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/two-rivers-manitowoc/"><strong>Two
Rivers</strong></a>, birthplace of the ice-cream sundae.</p>
<h3>Two Rivers to Green Bay via Door County, 179 miles</h3>
<p>Just north of Two Rivers, stop at Point Beach State Forest — or better
yet, ride your bike there on the lovely Rawley Point Trail.</p>
<p>In <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/sturgeon-bay/"><strong>Sturgeon
Bay</strong></a>, the
door to the Door Peninsula, stop to see the town's three lighthouses.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/i/sister_bay_resort.jpg" alt="Little Sister Resort in Door County." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Kayakers push off from a resort in Sister Bay, on the Door Peninsula.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/"><strong>Door Peninsula</strong></a> is worth
a long weekend, at least. But if you only have time for drive-by
sightseeing, you can see the highlights and take a stroll or two in a
lakefront park.</p>
<p>Head up the peninsula on the Lake Michigan side, stopping at <a href="https://www.doorcounty.com/experience/cave-point-county-park/">Cave Point
County
Park</a>
just south of Jacksonport. At Baileys Harbor, walk the boardwalk and
trails of <a href="https://www.ridgessanctuary.org/">Ridges Sanctuary</a>, home of
rare wildflowers and two old range lights.</p>
<p>If have time, continue around Rowleys Bay to Newport State Park and the
curving white-sand beach at Europe Bay.</p>
<p>Otherwise, turn around at Sister Bay and head down the Green Bay side,
stopping to look around Peninsula State Park and the charming towns of
Ephraim, <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/fish-creek-door-county/">Fish
Creek</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/egg-harbor-door-county/">Egg
Harbor</a>.</p>
<p>Then you're back in Green Bay. If you didn't get there before, or if
your kids need a break from driving, visit <a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/amusement-parks/bay-beach-amusement-park-203589">Bay Beach Amusement
Park</a>
and ride the Zippin Pippin, a replica of Elvis' favorite roller coast
in Memphis.</p>
