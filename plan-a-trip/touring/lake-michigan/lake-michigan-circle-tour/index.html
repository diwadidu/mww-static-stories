<h2>A road trip around this sandy inland sea uncovers multiple personalities.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/e/wells_park_beach.jpg" alt="The beach at J.W. Wells State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Upper Peninsula, Wells State Park doesn't get the crowds of
beaches in Lower Michigan.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If Lake Superior is the drama queen of the Great Lakes, then Lake
Michigan is president of the pep club.</p>
<p>It's beautiful, popular and a lot easier to get along with than its
tempestuous sister. Its shores are lined with sand, not jagged cliffs,
and its beaches attract festive crowds every summer.</p>
<p>It's the only Great Lake you can circle without a passport, and if you
don't want to drive around the whole thing, you can take a short cut on
a car ferry.</p>
<p>It's still a little moody, though. Shipwrecks litter the bottom, because
sandy shoals can snag a boat as surely as rock.</p>
<p>But Lake Michigan hardly is wild. It's been thoroughly domesticated,
with two giant cities near its foot, a bevy of beach towns on the east
and a long chain of state and national parks.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The 1,100-mile tour of its shores is a classic road trip, featuring the
world's largest freshwater dunes, a fabled island, a restored ghost
town, the world's third-longest suspension bridge and one magnificent
beach after another.</p>
<p>The route goes through four states — five, if you count the Upper
Peninsula — and you can travel from steel mill to heron habitat in 10
minutes.</p>
<p>It's never boring, that's for sure.</p>
<p>We traveled it the third week in June, right before the tourist season
started in earnest.</p>
<p>Seven years earlier, we'd done the half-Circle Tour, cutting off the
southern part by taking the car ferry between Ludington, Mich., and
Manitowoc, Wis.</p>
<p>This time, we wanted to see the famous beaches between Ludington and
Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. We wanted to stay overnight on
Mackinac Island and spend time in Traverse City. We wanted more of
everything.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/a/fayette_ruins.jpg" alt="Ruins at Fayette Townsite." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Garden Peninsula, tourists wander through the ruins and buildings
of historic Fayette.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A Circle Tour is drive-by tourism; the first time, you can't do much
more than gape, snap a photo and move on.</p>
<p>The second time, you try to catch what you missed the first time. But
you still have to keep moving.</p>
<h3>Starting on the Wisconsin-Michigan border</h3>
<p>We started at the Menominee River, where <em>Marinette,</em>  Wis., and
<em>Menominee,</em> Mich., sit on opposite sides.</p>
<p>The working-class Upper Peninsula is far removed from the wealthy
enclaves of Lower Michigan; its spiritual home is Green Bay, not Grosse
Pointe. Much of the land was tax-forfeited during the 1930s and now is
state and national forest.</p>
<p>Our first stop was J.W. Wells State Park, where we stayed in the first
of a string of very nice state-park cabins.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/michigan-state-park-cabins/">Michigan's great lake
cabins</a>.</p>
<p>The next day on the beach, we ran into a couple from Manistique who love
to explore the area.</p>
<p>They mapped out the things they thought we should see: Fayette Historic
Townsite on the Garden Peninsula, Kitch-iti-kipi Spring near Indian
Lake, the hiking trail down the 100-foot gorge of the Cut
River near
Naubinway.</p>
<p>U.S. 2 hums with vehicles heading cross-country, but few stop at nearby
attractions.</p>
<p>You have to drive 17 miles down the <em>Garden Peninsula</em> to see the
<em><a href="http://www.michigan.gov/fayettetownsite">Fayette Historic Townsite</a>,</em>
but once there, it's easy to imagine the description in the 1882
Schoolcraft County Pioneer: &quot;Fayette looks like a little Chicago this
week; the harbor is full of boats and business is brisk.&quot;</p>
<p>The little company town on the cliff-lined bay was a boom town in the
1870s and '80s, when its giant furnaces smelted ore into iron.</p>
<p>Today, visitors wander paths between the preserved music hall, hotel,
bank, superintendent's home and boardinghouse, each with exhibits on the
people who lived, worked or entertained there.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/manistique_spring.jpg" alt="Kitchi-iti-kipi Spring." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From a raft, people can peer at the bubbling bottom of Kitch-iti-kipi
Spring on the Upper Peninsula.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Thirteen bottles that once contained 9,000 doses of morphine were found
behind the walls of one house, and visitors can try to answer the
question, &quot;Who do you think was the morphine addict?&quot;</p>
<p>We were barely back on the highway before we made the 11-mile detour to
Palms Book State Park and <em><a href="http://www.visitmanistique.com/bigspring.shtml">Kitch-iti-kipi
Spring</a>.</em></p>
<p>From our raft, we gazed at its bubbling bottom through a viewing well.
We were propelled by a 10-year-old girl from Victoria, B.C., who liked
to crank the cable along which it rode.</p>
<p>Ten thousand gallons a minute hurl themselves upward through a limestone
fissure, making the white sand on the bottom dance and swirl. It was
hypnotizing, like watching an emerald-tinted aerial view of an erupting
volcano.</p>
<p>We continued east through <em>Manistique,</em> whose high-school teams are
called the Emeralds after the spring. There's a lovely beach there,
right around the corner from the red pierhead light, but we were headed
for <em>St. Ignace</em> and the ferry to <em>Mackinac Island.</em></p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinac_fort_bicyclist.jpg" alt="A bicyclist rides by Fort Mackinac." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Mackinac Island, Fort Mackinac looms over the harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/best-sights-mackinac-island/">Mackinac Island by bicycle</a></h3>
<p>We'd brought our own bikes, and as soon as we arrived on the island, we
circled it on the eight-mile Lake Shore Road, also known as M-185, the
only state highway in the nation that doesn't allow cars.</p>
<p>In the golden light before dusk, it seemed sun-kissed and magical.</p>
<p>There's more to this fabled island than fudge shops and Fort Mackinac,
which I toured on my first visit. This time, we poked into every nook
and cranny, from wooded nature trails to the ruins of a British fort.</p>
<p>We crossed paths with the crowds only on Main Street and the path to
Arch Rock, to which most tourists ride on horse-drawn trolleys.</p>
<p>Toward the end of Sunday afternoon, we returned to watch the big Lilac
Festival parade, featuring the cross-dressing Scottsville Clown Band.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinaw_city_gunners.jpg" alt="Soldiers at Colonial Michilimackinac." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Soldiers prepare to fire a cannon at Colonial Michilimackinac.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>After two nights, we returned to St. Ignace and crossed the five-mile
Mackinac Bridge, thinking about the Yugo that was blown over the side in 1989
by gale-force winds. Luckily, it was calm that day.</p>
<p>Colonial Michilimackinac, a re-created British fur post, is right on the
strait in <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/mackinaw-city-colonial-michilimackinac/">Mackinaw
City</a></strong>
and a great stop for families, especially those with kids who might like
to see soldiers fire cannons and muskets.</p>
<p>For more about the Circle Tour with children, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-tour/">Lake Michigan with
kids</a>.</p>
<p>We kept going to <em>Cross Village</em> and the Legs Inn, a folk-art landmark
whose fieldstone façade is lined with white stove legs.</p>
<p>It was founded by a Polish immigrant in 1921, and we guessed, correctly,
that it would be showing World Cup soccer games. So we settled at the
bar to eat a plate of pierogis and watch Spain play Honduras.</p>
<p>Nearly everyone else was on the flower-filled patio, sampling some of
100 beers served by young, dirndl-clad waitresses from Poland. Just
beyond, the lawn rolled to the shore of Lake Michigan.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/e/petoskey_honeymooners.jpg" alt="Bicycling on the Little Traverse Wheelway." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicyclists ride through Petoskey on the Little Traverse Wheelway.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Down the Tunnel of Trees</h3>
<p>We couldn't imagine a better place to while away an afternoon, but we
kept going down M-119, also called the Tunnel of Trees.</p>
<p>The twisting road, barely wide enough for two cars to pass, has views of
Lake Michigan and is famous for its spring wildflowers and fall color.</p>
<p>But it was June and we'd just spent two days bicycling on Mackinac's
more-scenic M-185, so we weren't that impressed.</p>
<p>The drive ends in the old-money enclave of <em>Harbor Springs.</em>  We drove
on to the new-money enclave of <em>Petoskey,</em>  where we tried in vain to
find a trailhead of the 23-mile Little Traverse Wheelway, thinking one
of us could ride it to Charlevoix.</p>
<p>We rode it later, one May, and it was beautiful. For more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycle-trails-michigan/">Bicycling in western
Michigan</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><em>Charlevoix</em> is a pleasant tourist town squeezed between Lake Michigan
and big Lake Charlevoix.</p>
<p>It's known for its ties to Ernest Hemingway, who spent his boyhood
summers there, and for the stone &quot;mushroom houses&quot; designed and built
by local resident Earl Young.</p>
<p>From downtown, we took a stroll along the channel to Lake Michigan, past
Young's Weathervane Inn. As we left town, we wound through the adjoining
neighborhood, past some of his whimsical homes.</p>
<h3>On Grand Traverse Bay</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Traverse
City</a></strong>
is the first of the big beach towns. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-lake-michigan/">America's
freshwater Riviera</a>.</p>
<p>We checked into a cabin in Traverse City State Park, just across the
highway from the beach on the East Arm of Grand Traverse Bay.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/traverse_city_statue.jpg" alt="The lakefront in Traverse City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The lakefront in Traverse City is devoted to bicycling and swimming.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The 10½-mile TART Trail runs alongside the park, so we hopped on and
rode to the West Arm beaches, the marina, the adorable downtown and the
Old Town district.</p>
<p>People can and do spend a week or more here. It's both beach town and
cultural capital, with free music and festivals all summer, including
the giant National Cherry Festival in early July.</p>
<p>Bicyclists like to ride its trails and also the roads around nearby
Torch Lake and up the Old Mission Peninsula, which separates the two
lobes of Grand Traverse Bay, and the <em>Leelanau Peninsula,</em> between the
bay and Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>When we drove up the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/old-mission-peninsula-michigan-spring/"><strong>Old Mission Peninsula</strong></a>,
ripening cherries were bright red in the orchards, and roadside stands
sold strawberries.</p>
<p>Local farmers also grow grapes on this water-wrapped finger of land; at
Chateau Chantal Winery, we stopped for a taste of the local pinot blanc.</p>
<p>We visited the Old Mission Light on the tip of that peninsula, and the
Grand Traverse Light at the tip of the Leelanau Peninsula.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/m/empire_dune_climb.jpg" alt="Dune Climb at Sleeping Bear." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Dune Climb is part of Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In <em>Leland,</em> we stopped at touristy Fish Town, whose weathered shanties
now are occupied by T-shirt shops.</p>
<h3>Playing in a giant sandbox</h3>
<p>From Leland, it's not far to <em>Empire</em> and <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/sleeping-bear-dunes/">Sleeping Bear Dunes
National Lakeshore</a>.</strong> Kids adore this giant
playground of sand, and we spent several days there on the first trip.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we stopped to do the classic Dune Climb and hike the
Empire Bluff Trail again. We hit them in the golden hour before dusk,
when the vast swath of sand glowed.</p>
<p>In <em>Manistee,</em> we stopped to tour the 1930 steamship <a href="https://www.carferry.com/">S.S. City of
Milwaukee</a>, beached on the shore like a
whale with its mouth propped open.</p>
<p>Once, this boat transported entire freight trains across Lake Michigan.
Today, it's also a bed-and-breakfast, with rooms outfitted with
antique-store finds from the era and a lake view from every angle.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/ludington_tubing2.jpg" alt="Tubing in Ludington State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Ludington State Park, a family tubes down the Big Sable River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In <em>Ludington,</em> we picked up a picnic lunch downtown and took it to
Ludington State Park, one of the most popular in Michigan.</p>
<p>It's like a little resort, with four campgrounds plus tubing, canoeing,
swimming, bicycling, a store and evening music and stories in the
amphitheater.</p>
<p>&quot;People come for 50 years, and then they bring their grandkids,&quot; said
friendly campground host Stub Willick. He turned out to be a drummer in
the Scottville Clown Band, founded in 1903; we'd seen them performing,
memorably, in Mackinac Island's Lilac Festival parade.</p>
<p>We rode our bikes through the dunes to the 1867 Big Sable Point
Lighthouse and caught the last tour. Volunteer keeper Larry Gorsh took
us up the 132 steps to the catwalk, which had a sweeping view of dunes
and water.</p>
<p>&quot;I've often caught myself saying to visitors, 'Look out at the ocean,'
&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Our next stop was <em>Muskegon,</em> a working port where it's not so easy to
find the beach.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/holland_lighthouse_beach.jpg" alt="The beach and lighthouse at Holland State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Holland, Big Red stands at the Lake Macatawa entry to Lake Michigan.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Winding our way through town, we finally found the long beach at Pere
Marquette Park, and nearby the World War II submarine U.S.S.
Silversides, part of the Great Lakes Naval Memorial &amp; Museum.</p>
<h3>Sleeping on the beach</h3>
<p>We washed up for the night at Holland State Park in the Dutch town of
<em>Holland,</em> where we had a camper cabin at the edge of the beach, with a
view of the beloved Big Red lighthouse.</p>
<p>When everyone else had to leave for the day, we got to stay, and we were
first on the beach in the morning.</p>
<p>Just south of Holland, <em>Saugatuck</em> is another popular beach town. Its
streets were thronged with shoppers and strollers, many sampling fudge.
In Lower Michigan, eating fudge is a required tourist activity, much as
eating pasties is on the U.P.</p>
<p>On our way to lunch, we walked past the S.S. Keewatin, a passenger liner
that once sailed between Thunder Bay and Port McNicoll on Lake Superior.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/warren_dunes_beach.jpg" alt="The beach at Warren Dunes State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
There's room for everyone on the long, wide beach at Warren Dunes State
Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We would have liked to visit Oval Beach, reached via hand-cranked chain
ferry across the Kalamazoo River, but we had to move on.</p>
<p>In <em>South Haven,</em>  we spotted the <a href="https://www.michiganmaritimemuseum.org/explore/our-fleet/friends-good-will/">Friends Good
Will</a>, a replica of an 1810 square-topsail sloop, coming into the harbor and
its berth at the <a href="http://michiganmaritimemuseum.org/">Michigan Maritime
Museum</a>.</p>
<p>There was a beach downtown, and also beaches all the way down the shore,
each populated with sunbathers and swimmers.</p>
<p>It seemed to extend all the way to <em>Warren Dunes State Park,</em> where the
beach seemed to go on forever. Giant dunes rose behind it, with paths
lined by wildflowers. It was a balmy evening, and we weren't the only
ones who stayed well into dusk.</p>
<h3>On the Red Arrow Highway</h3>
<p>From nearby <em>Sawyer,</em> we traveled on an old stretch of the Red Arrow
Highway, part of the 1922 West Michigan Pike between Chicago and
Mackinaw City.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_buffalo_beach.jpg" alt="The beach in New Buffalo, Mich." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In New Buffalo, a decorative lighthouse stands on the town beach.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Parallel I-94 now carries most of the traffic, but this stretch is fun
for its old-time roadhouses, fruit stands and antiques stores.</p>
<p>Around <em>Harbert,</em> art galleries and an Italian <em>ristorante</em>
appeared, signs of the Chicagoans for
whom this area is a favorite weekend getaway.</p>
<p>In <em>Union Pier,</em> we stopped and bought plump berries and baked goods at
the Saturday-morning farmers market.</p>
<p>Near the Indiana border, we stopped in <a href="http://newbuffalo.org/">New
Buffalo</a>, the closest town to the Indiana
border, and spent an hour swimming at the town beach.</p>
<p>Then we crossed the border and started looking for Indiana Dunes
National Park, which looked large on the map but turned out to be
elusive.</p>
<p>We finally found a beach where we could park. It was beautiful, but it
was flanked on both sides by steel mills, and we could see the outline
of Chicago in the haze. Created by a swap with the steel industry, the
park is an oasis that harbors wetlands and wildlife.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_beachfront.jpg" alt="Oak Street Beach in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Chicago's Oak Street Beach is part of a string of gorgeous beaches in
the city.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>U.S. 12 through <em>Gary</em> was a trip through the Third World, though we
still were following Circle Tour signs. An astringent smell hung in the
air, and the only nice building we saw was a shiny blue-glass casino.</p>
<p><em><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/">Chicago</a></em>
has gorgeous beaches. But the next time we saw Lake Michigan, it was on
the other side of the city at <em>Illinois Beach State Park,</em>  near
Waukegan.</p>
<p>It's big, with a 6-mile-long beach, trails through nature preserves,
wildflowers and a campground.</p>
<p>Park facilities have had problems with maintenance, due to underfunding,
but the beach itself is beautiful. And for campers who don't want to
cook, there's a conference center with a restaurant.</p>
<h3>Lighthouses in Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Ahead of us lay Kenosha, Racine and Milwaukee, all with gorgeous beaches
and lighthouses.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/a/racine_wind_point2.jpg" alt="Wind Point Lighthouse in Racine." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the north end of Racine, 108-foot Wind Point Lighthouse was designed
by Orlando Poe.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The beach in downtown <em>Kenosha</em>  stretches from two adorable,
candy-striped pierhead lights, and the 1866 Southport Lighthouse is up
the hill. The Electric Streetcar Circulator makes a two-mile loop along
the shoreline and through downtown and historic districts.</p>
<p>In <em>Racine,</em>  the 1880 <a href="http://windpointlighthouse.org/">Wind Point
Lighthouse</a> is a classic Poe tower
that's one of the tallest on the Great Lakes. If you're there on the
first Sunday of the month from June through October, you can tour it.</p>
<p>A bike trail connects <a href="http://www.racine.org/north_beach.html">North
Beach</a> to the Racine Zoo and
downtown, where kids can run through the multi-jet fountain at Pershing
Park without getting sandy.</p>
<p>Like Chicago, <em><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/milwaukee/">Milwaukee</a></em> is a destination in
itself. Its lakeshore is lined with tourist attractions and is fun to cruise either in a car or on a bike.</p>
<p><em>Port Washington</em> is a stop on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/Interurban-milwaukee-bike-trails/">Interurban bicycle
trail</a>
and a good place to charter a fishing boat.</p>
<p><em><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/sheboygan-wisconsin/">Sheboygan</a></em> has a lovely beach at Deland Park

<p><em>Manitowoc,</em>  where the Wisconsin Maritime Museum includes the U.S.S.
Cobia submarine, and <em><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/two-rivers-manitowoc/">Two
Rivers</a></em>
are linked by a bicycle trail right on the lake.</p>
<p>Point Beach State Forest, just north of Two Rivers, has perhaps
Wisconsin's loveliest beaches and a lighthouse whose elegance rivals
Racine's.</p>
<p>Like Milwaukee, <em><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/">Door County</a></em> is a
destination well worth a week to itself; it's very popular, like
Michigan's beach towns all pushed together on one peninsula.</p>
<p>If you're closing the loop, your next stop will be <em><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/green-bay-kids/">Green
Bay</a>,</em> in
Packer country.</p>
<p>It's crawling with football fans every day, but if you're there in
August, you can join the festivities around the Packers' <a href="https://www.packers.com/training-camp/">training
camp</a>, which Sports Illustrated
calls one of the best and most fan-friendly in the nation.</p>
