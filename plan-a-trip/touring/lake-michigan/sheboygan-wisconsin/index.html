<h2>Surfers, sculptors and sausage makers all follow their passion in this Wisconsin town.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/sheboygan_surfer2.jpg" alt="A surfer in Sheboygan." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>As far as most people know, there's nothing but sausage in Sheboygan.</p>
<p>This town on Lake Michigan is the bull's-eye of brats, for sure, and
serious eaters go straight for a double on Sheboygan hard roll.</p>
<p>But serious sightseers come to Sheboygan for other reasons: for surfing,
for quirky sculptures, for sand dunes.</p>
<p>The town's central location on Wisconsin's coastline, which first made
it a shipbuilding hub, now brings surfers.</p>
<p>On the first morning of October, they'd gotten up at dawn to ride the
last waves of a gale the previous day, and black figures bobbed in the
waters off Deland Park, occasionally riding a wave onto the white-sand
beach.</p>
<p>&quot;Being in the middle of the lake, the north winds work here, and the
south winds work here,&quot; said Alex Marks. &quot;Some days it's like a
machine, with one wave right after another, peeling perfectly.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Surfers call it the Malibu of the Midwest: &quot;For lake surfing, this is
mecca,&quot; Marks said.</p>
<p>The surfers are fun to watch. But another mecca is up over the hill, on
the edge of downtown.</p>
<p>Ever since John Michael Kohler sold his first bathtub there in 1883,
Sheboygan's fortunes have been tied to his family.</p>
<p>Kohlers have given the town mayors, factories, golf courses, a state
park — but also an arts center and foundation whose urge to preserve
has made Wisconsin the epicenter of outsider art.</p>
<p>Its lovingly preserved &quot;art environments&quot; by artists who lacked money,
education and polish — everything except passion — are scattered
<a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/Wisconsin-folk-art/">throughout the state</a>, on the grounds of the John Michael Kohler Arts Center and even inside
its walls.</p>
<p>Loy Bowlin's &quot;Beautiful Holy Jewel Home of the Original Rhinestone
Cowboy&quot; in Mississippi landed there after the Kohler Foundation rescued
it from the wrecking ball and brought it to Sheboygan.</p>
<p>A classic example of outsider art, it's a real house, and every inch of
it is covered by glitter, tinfoil, Christmas ornaments, rhinestones and
collages cut from magazines. When it was reassembled inside the arts
center, it redefined &quot;art&quot; for many people who saw it.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/sheboygan_theater.jpg" alt="The performing arts center in Sheboygan." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 1928 Sheboygan Theatre is on the National Register of Historic
Places.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Dorothy Sherman came up from the Milwaukee suburbs to see it with her
friend Pat Ulman.</p>
<p>&quot;This was a guy who was a nobody, and now he's in an art museum,&quot; she
said. &quot;See — follow your passion, Pat.&quot;</p>
<p>The exhibit fascinated her, Sherman said, because the artist had dared
to think outside the box.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm the kind of person who always takes a class so I do it right,&quot;
she said. &quot;But these people don't care about that. They don't care
what people think about them. They just do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Before &quot;just do it&quot; was an advertising slogan, it was a way of life
in Sheboygan.</p>
<p>John Michael Kohler just did it when he enameled a cast-iron horse
trough and turned it into an empire.</p>
<p>On the lakefront, Larry and Lee Williams just did it when they turned
this Midwest burg into a freshwater surfing destination, drawing
thousands to their Dairyland Surf Classic over Labor Day.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The city, having found the remains of the 1876 schooner Lottie Cooper
while planning a marina, just brought it up and put it on display in
Deland Park. Of the thousands of ships wrecked on the Great Lakes,
theirs is the only one you can walk through.</p>
<p>Downtown, Stefano Viglietti, inspired by childhood vacations to Italy,
helped turn Sheboygan into a dining destination with a popular
trattoria, Neapolitan pizzeria, Mediterranean café-grocery and, with his
sister, an English pub.</p>
<p>And yet the locals are self-deprecating, sometimes ironically referring
to Sheboygan as SheVegas, also the name of a local lounge.</p>
<p>Actually, there are big blinking marquee lights downtown, because a
theater foundation preserved the lighted sign of the 1928 Sheboygan
Theatre, now the Stefanie H. Weill Center for the Performing Arts. But
it's true that the town isn't known for nightlife.</p>
<p>&quot;Not much is said about Sheboygan,&quot; says Peggy Tauschek, who owns
Victorian Chocolates on Eighth Street and is known for the
chocolate-covered raspberries she sells year-round.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/sheboygan_arts_center.jpg" alt="The grounds of Kohler Arts Center." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;We had one lady from Indiana here for a wedding, and she said, 'We
never heard of Sheboygan, but we love it.' They were kind of amazed.&quot;</p>
<p>Many tourists first are drawn to Sheboygan by the Blue Harbor Resort and
Conference Center, across the river from downtown on the Lake Michigan
waterfront.</p>
<p>It looks like a grand Victorian oceanside resort, but it was built in
2004 and has an indoor water park. A walking path winds through the
waving dune grasses that constitute its front yard.</p>
<p>The Sheboygan River is lined with new shops and restaurants that occupy
brightly colored New England-style buildings on the Blue Harbor side and
fishing shanty-style buildings on the town side.</p>
<p>There are lots of interesting shops in Sheboygan, most notably Artspace,
the gift shop in Kohler Arts Center, and more in nearby Kohler.</p>
<p>But the ones downtown are closed on Sunday, which is when folks head to
the beach, the lakefront walking and bicycling paths and to
Kohler-Andrae State Park, just south of town.</p>
<p>The park has a lovely stretch of beach along Lake Michigan. But it's
known for its sand dunes, which can be viewed on a boardwalk that
crosses them like a suspension bridge, dipping and rising to follow
their contours.</p>
<p>From the nature center, hikers can make a loop, following the breezy
beach southward and returning amid the sheltered dunes. In spring and
summer, hikers can look for bog flowers along the marsh boardwalk and
trail.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/sheboygan_tellen_elves.jpg" alt="Elves at the Tellen folk-art site." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Concrete elves make merry at James Tellen Woodland Sculpture Garden.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Sheboygan's very own outsider-art environment is less than three miles
north of the park, in a wooded residential neighborhood.</p>
<p>James Tellen worked in a furniture factory in Sheboygan, painting
decorative details. In 1942, in a hospital recovering from an illness,
he was inspired by the concrete sculptures he could see in the
churchyard across the street.</p>
<p>For the remaining 15 years of his life, he created concrete figures for
the yard of his log summer cottage, often displaying a sly sense of
humor.</p>
<p>In the hollow of a tree, below elves snickering in the branches,
visitors look past a sign that reads, &quot;If you look into this tree, the
one you love best you will see,&quot; and into a mirror.</p>
<p>A piece inscribed &quot;We whistle while we work&quot; shows the Seven Dwarves
in party mode, playing musical instruments and making wine. A tavern
scene shows a woman scolding a man who has toppled onto his hands and
knees, while four proper townsfolk look on.</p>
<p>There's a young Abraham Lincoln splitting a log and a 65-foot-long
&quot;Fallen Log,&quot; is a free-form concrete fence that features a bear, cubs
and an Indian man, woman and child.</p>
<p>Around Sheboyan, folks march to the beat of their own drummer. Including
the sausage makers: You can buy their brats plain and with beer and
cheese, but also flavored by fennel, garlic, jalapenos and caraway.</p>
<p>In Sheboygan, the spice of life is variety.</p>

dressing up to drive into town in his '67 Cadillac, to which he'd
affixed a rack of glittering longhorns.</p>
<p>He would play harmonica, dance, tell jokes and autograph pictures of
himself, and eventually he became famous. He was never lonely again.</p>
