<p>Not many parents would think that a long road trip would be a perfect
vacation to take with young children.</p>
<p>But the shores of Lake Michigan is one big sandbox, and on a drive along
its shores, you'll hit one big playground after another.</p>
<p>On the east side, Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is spectacular,
a Disneyland of sand. But the lake also is lined with lighthouses, fudge
shops, fur-trade forts and endless beaches.</p>
<p>And at the end — for us, anyway — there was a trip on a cruise ship,
because we took the short cut back on the S.S. Badger.</p>
<p>For the full tour, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/circle-tour-lake-michigan/">Circling Lake
Michigan</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-circle-tour-highlights/">Lake Michigan's greatest
hits</a>.</p>

<p>One June, I set out to see Lake Michigan with my daughter Madeleine and
my son Peter. We reached the big lake in <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/green-bay-kids/">Green
Bay</a> and
headed straight for one of Wisconsin's favorite family attractions.</p>
<p>At old-fashioned Bay Beach Amusement Park, we paid 50 cents apiece to
ride the Rambler, the Yo-Yo, the Ferris wheel and the train that runs
along the bay shore, lined with tall rushes that glowed in the
early-evening sun.</p>
<p>Now, the park includes the Zippin Pippin roller coast, which charges a
whole $1.</p>
<p>The beach house with cupola and waving flag, the beehives of blue cotton
candy and the 1970s prices were portents of our tour through Michigan's
down-home Upper Peninsula, which culturally is much closer to Green Bay
than to Lansing or Detroit.</p>
<p>From Green Bay, we headed north to <em>Peshtigo</em> . In 1871, the logging
town of 1,700 was consumed by a cyclonic firestorm that approached at
300 mph; warned only by a mounting roar, townspeople had time only to
grab their Bibles and run.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/s/escanaba_lighthouse.jpg" alt="The lighthouse in Escanaba." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 1868 Sand Point Lighthouse in Escanaba commemorates its first
keeper, a woman.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;It's said that the next day, people found so many Bible pages floating
in the air, they thought it was the end of the world,&quot; said the
curator/guide at the Peshtigo Fire Museum.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people died, a number that still stands as the nation's
largest loss of life due to fire. But no one paid much attention because
of another fire on the same day: The Great Chicago Fire of 1871.</p>
<p>We crossed into Michigan at <em>Menominee</em> , where we stopped for our first
pasty, a beef-and-vegetable miner's lunch that's still found across the
blue-collar Upper Peninsula.</p>
<p>Hugging the lakeshore on Michigan 35, we could see the dunes of Door
County across Green Bay, and shifting bands of color in the shallow
waters offshore: celadon, slate-blue, burgundy.</p>
<p>In <em>Escanaba</em> , we drove past big Ludington Park to the 1868 Sand Point
Lighthouse, where a cardboard cutout of Mary Terry stood by the door.
Terry, keeper of the light for its first 18 years, lost her life in an
1886 fire whose causes still are being debated.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Muscular Escanaba still ships taconite, which lies in piles around the
harbor, but its extra-wide main street and abundance of brownstone
storefronts speak of the port's richer days.</p>
<p>In <em>Manistique</em> , we walked along a two-mile boardwalk and out to the
1915 breakwater light. From Manistique, U.S. 2 winds inland to
Naubinway, where it rejoins Lake Michigan and winds down to St. Ignace.</p>
<p>From St. Ignace, we got on a ferry and sailed for <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/best-sights-mackinac-island/">Mackinac
Island</a>. Camera shutters started
clicking as we approached the sprawling Grand Hotel on the bluff.</p>
<p>Billowing lilacs lined sidewalks, and baskets of geranium and ivy
cascaded from lampposts. As we walked up to the Disneyesque main street,
a smiling bride and groom clopped by in a horse-drawn carriage.</p>
<p>&quot;This smells like the State Fair,&quot; my son Peter said, sniffing a
mixture of caramel corn, suntan lotion and manure.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinac_soldiers_girl.jpg" alt="A little visitor marches with soldiers at Fort Mackinac." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A young recruit marches with the soldiers at Fort Mackinac.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;We've seen seven fudge shops so far — oh look, eight,&quot; Madeleine
said. Then she, too, inhaled. &quot;Oh, that's almost cruel — they're
blowing the smell out at us.&quot;</p>
<p>Mackinac Island is a tourist trap, no question. But on a sunny, breezy
day when the lilacs are blooming, it's also astoundingly lovely.</p>
<p>For a while, we sat on a pebble beach and watched the ferries come and
go. We walked out to Arch Rock along a path lined with yellow moccasins
and pussytoes.</p>
<p>We strolled past frilly Victorian inns and two of its historic churches,
both with weddings in progress.</p>
<p>We climbed up to Fort Mackinac, an 18th-century fur-trade depot whose
soldiers eventually were put to work taking care of tourists, and had
lunch on the terrace of the Tea Room, 150 feet above the harbor.</p>
<p>The next day we crossed the Straits of Mackinac on the 5-mile-long
<em>Mackinac Bridge</em> , suspended 15 stories above the water.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mackinaw_city_voyageurs.jpg" alt="Voyageurs at Colonial Michilimackinac." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/mackinaw-city-colonial-michilimackinac/">Mackinaw
City</a></strong>, we spent the day watching demonstrations and reenactments at <em>Colonial
Michilimackinac</em> , a palisade fort built by the French in 1715 and today
restored and staffed by interpreters who portray the year 1775, when it
was controlled by the British.</p>
<p>From Mackinaw City, we followed the lake down to <em>Harbor Springs</em> ,
where we drove through the old-money enclave of the Wequetonsing
Association, founded in 1880, and into the gleaming downtown of
galleries and cafes, ending up on the sugar sand of Zorn Park Beach.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything's perfect,&quot; Madeleine noted.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone's rich,&quot; Peter replied.</p>
<p>We'd left the U.P. far behind and entered the orbit of affluent Detroit
and Chicago. From Harbor Springs we drove on to <em>Petoskey</em> , with its
Historic Gaslight District and faux-Victorian development just west of
town, the Village on Bay Harbor.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In pleasant <em>Charlevoix</em> , which straddles the channel between Lake
Michigan and Lake Charlevoix, we took a break to eat frozen custard and
stroll downtown, and to wade on the Michigan Avenue beach, a tucked-away
pocket of sand across from a cement factory.</p>
<p>We negotiated the busy strip through <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Traverse
City</a></strong>
, the first of the great Lake Michigan <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-lake-michigan/">beach
towns</a>, and headed
straight west for Empire and <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/sleeping-bear-dunes/">Sleeping Bear Dunes National
Lakeshore</a>.</p>
<p>There, we took a few days to play in the sand, along a dramatic
coastline the Ojibwe likened to a reclining bear, across from two
islands that represent her cubs.</p>
<p>We canoed down the Platte River, then got into its warm, crystal-clear
water to swim the rest of the way into icy Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>We scrambled up the Dune Climb, an inland Sahara with a panorama of Glen
Lake.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/l/sleeping_bear_platte_girls.jpg" alt="Girls run into the Platte River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, girls run into the Platte
River near its mouth on Lake Michigan.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We walked along the top of the &quot;450,&quot; a dune that descends into the
lake from Pierce Stocking Scenic Drive, and swam from the sandbar that
separates warm North Bar Lake from cold Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>One day, we drove up the <em>Leelanau Peninsula</em> , a name invented by Henry
Schoolcraft, the Indian agent/scholar who also came with the name Itasca
for the Mississippi headwaters.</p>
<p>Considered the little finger of the lower Michigan &quot;mitten,&quot; it's a
tourist backwater compared with the Traverse City area but still has its
share of fudge shops and boutiques.</p>
<p>In <em>Leland</em> , we wandered through Fishtown, a collection of weathered
gray fishing shanties that now house gift and candy shops.</p>
<p>From there, ferries take backcountry campers to North Manitou Island and
day-trippers to South Manitou Island, which has an 1871 lighthouse, a
grove of giant cedars, the visible wreck of the Francisco Morazan and
ranger talks that cover island history.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In <em>Northport</em> , we stopped for root-beer floats and to swim at the
municipal beach. At the tip of the peninsula, in Leelanau State Park, we
visited the 1858 Grand Traverse Light.</p>
<p>Our favorite spot along the lakeshore was <em>Empire</em> , a former logging
village named for a schooner that became icebound there in 1865. You
could buy pasties, and it seemed the whole town congregated at the
municipal beach, where we watched a spectacular sunset.</p>
<p>For now, this part of Michigan is the province of the middle class. As
we drove south, we noticed many small resorts on Crystal Lake and Bear
Lake.</p>
<p>In the port of <em>Manistee</em> , we walked through the handsome Victorian
downtown, all of it on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>Then we were in <em>Ludington</em> , and it was time to board the S.S. Badger
car ferry, a coal-driven behemoth that's been traversing the lake since
1953.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_michigan_badger.jpg" alt="The S.S. Badger on Lake Michigan." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The S.S. Badger car ferry crosses the lake between Manitowoc, Wis., and
Ludington, Mich.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Less than half the size of a Great Lakes ore boat, it's still massive,
and we watched in fascination as the gigantic anchor rattled up on
oversized chains and the Badger slipped almost noiselessly out of the
Ludington harbor.</p>
<p>At first, we made like cruise-ship passengers, basking on deck chairs in
the warm morning sun, but the air grew frigid as we sailed into the
middle of the lake, and we fled inside.</p>
<p>There, we joined the lounging masses, watching movies and playing a game
of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Badger Billionaire.&quot;</p>
<p>Then we saw the candy-striped smokestacks of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/two-rivers-manitowoc/">Manitowoc</a>. Our Lake Michigan tour was over, but we hated to say goodbye.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Circle Tour of Lake Michigan with kids</h3>
<p><em>Adjust time zone</em> : If you're doing the tour clockwise, you'll have
to set your watch ahead about half an hour after crossing the Michigan
border at Menominee.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/e/leland_fishtown.jpg" alt="Shops in Leland's Fishtown." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Leland, the fishing shanties of Fishtown now hold galleries and
boutiques.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>When to go</em> : Mid-June and late August are good times to go; the
tourist areas are crowded in July and the first half of August.</p>
<p>Allow at least a week, more if you want to add a tour of Door County or
a side trip to <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/soo-locks-shipping-sault-ste-marie/">Sault Ste. Marie</a> (only an
hour from St. Ignace).</p>
<p><em>Planning a trip</em> : For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/circle-tour-lake-michigan/">Circling Lake

Lake
Michigan</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-circle-tour-highlights/">Lake Michigan's greatest
hits</a>.</p>
<p><em>Ferries:</em> Car ferry times may influence the decision to drive clockwise
or counterclockwise: From Ludington, the <a href="http://www.ssbadger.com/">S.S. Badger car
ferry</a> leaves at 9 a.m. (you'll be asked to
arrive earlier), and from Manitowoc, it leaves at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Manitowoc and its neighbor, Two Rivers, are well worth a stop. See <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/two-rivers-manitowoc/">Two
trails from Two
Rivers</a>.</p>
<p>To make a longer tour, start in Milwaukee or Muskegon and take the <a href="http://www.lake-express.com/">Lake
Express High-Speed Ferry</a> across the lake.
Crossings take 2½ hours.</p>
