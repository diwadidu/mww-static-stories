<h2>A 170-mile loop winds past lead mines, a famous grotto and a brewery town.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/potosi_brewery.jpg" alt="The brewery in Potosi." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The old mining town of Potosi got its brewery back.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Scratch the surface in southwest Wisconsin, and you'll find treasure.</p>
<p>In the 1820s, it took the form of lead ore that early miners, to their
amazement, found at the grassroots. Lead and zinc made this area bustle
when Milwaukee and Madison were just getting started, and one of its
villages served as the territory's first capital.</p>
<p>Today, visitors to this corner of the state — just across the Illinois
border and up the Mississippi bluffs — find a lode of history in a
beautiful landscape.</p>
<p>A 170-mile loop tour takes it all in: a hill that appears to violate the
law of gravity; a church built by a revered frontier priest; a famous
grotto; a brewery town from the &quot;badger&quot; era; a rediscovered 1845
lead mine; and the territory's first capital.</p>
<h3>Starting in Mineral Point</h3>
<p>The entire downtown of this lovely village is a national historic
district, and stone cottages built by Cornish miners are part of the
Wisconsin Historical Society's Pendarvis, where costumed guides give
daily tours.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Merry Christmas Mine was right across Shake Rag Street, which supposedly
was named for a mealtime ritual: When women in the cottages had dinner
ready, they'd wave a dish towel to catch the attention of the miner
working atop the hill.</p>
<p>&quot;Mineral&quot; first was found at the point where two streams converged,
and an old zinc-smelting chimney rises above nearby Ted's Pond. Today,
this pastoral spot near the end of Commerce Street is home to a cluster
of inns and restaurants.</p>
<p>The town is home to many artists, who have opened galleries and studios
along its hilly streets. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/mineral-point-art-tour/">Beauty in Mineral
Point</a>.</p>
<h3>Gift shops and Gravity Hill</h3>
<p>Heading south on Wisconsin 23, you'll go through Darlington to reach
Shullsburg, where mining continued until 1979.</p>
<p>It has weathered the full cycle. Solo miners came first, digging the
&quot;badger holes&quot; that inspired Wisconsin's nickname, followed by
corporations that pulled up millions of tons of lead and zinc ore.
Eventually, a drop in demand and new environmental standards closed the
mines.</p>
<p>But Shullsburg was left with a handsome collection of brick storefronts
from the 1840s. It hopes to emulate another lead-mining town that lined
its main street with shops and became a tourist favorite: Galena, just
across the border in Illinois.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/gravity_hill.jpg" alt="Gravity Hill near Shullsburg." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Shullsburg, Gravity Hill seems to defy physics.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's a rose-colored vision to match the town's rose-colored sidewalks,
adorned with old-fashioned lampposts. Along Water Street, attractive
shops sell gifts, cheese, kitchenware, primitive furnishings and bags of
chocolate &quot;tailings,&quot; the rock debris from mining.</p>
<p>At the Badger Mine &amp; Museum, tours include a descent into a hand-dug
19th-century mine.</p>
<p>From downtown, drive south to Gravity Hill, at the foot of two hills.
Put your car into neutral and see if your car starts rolling <em>up</em> the hill.</p>
<p>Then head west on Wisconsin 11, past the site of the big Calumet and
Hecla mine, the last to close in 1979. A pile of tailings marks the
Mulcahy Mine, where eight men died in a 1943 cave-in, the worst mining
accident in Wisconsin history.</p>
<p>The landscape is lumpy here, its rocky skeleton breaking through a thin
skin of vegetation. The hills of Illinois rise only three miles to the
south, and the official Illinois high point is just across the border,
near the village of Scales Mound.</p>
<h3>Father Mazzuchelli's church</h3>
<p>Just south of Wisconsin 11 in New Diggings, a weathered frame general
store/bar and a few houses are almost all that remains of the early boom
town.</p>
<p>But up the hill, there's one thing more — St. Augustine Church, built
in 1844 by Father Samuel Mazzuchelli.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_diggings_church.jpg" alt="Father Mazzuchelli's church in New Diggings." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
St. Augustine in New Diggings is the only church left as Father
Mazzuchelli built and designed it.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This revered Italian priest — called Father Michael Kelly by his Irish
flock — founded 40 parishes and built 17 churches between Mackinac
Island and Muscatine, Iowa.</p>
<p>This one he built with hammer in hand, notching the wood planks to
resemble the stonework of churches in his native Italy, complete with
dentils and moldings.</p>
<p>The priest is being considered for sainthood, and George Burns, a member
of the Mazzuchelli Awareness Campaign, said its existence should count
as one of the required miracles: &quot;For it to be still standing, without
any alteration, in an isolated place like this — that's a
miracle.&quot;</p>
<p>Three miles west of New Diggings off County Road W, drive the pastoral,
7½-mile Rustic Road 66, which follows the Coon Branch of the Galena
River, a twisting gash in the flat coulee floor, and past the tunnel of
an old rail line.</p>
<h3>An inspiring shrine in Dickeyville</h3>
<p>The old Illinois mining town of Galena, named for lead ore, is only nine
miles south of the old stagecoach stop of Hazel Green. From there, head
north to Cuba City and west to Dickeyville.</p>
<p>Between 1925 and 1930, a German-born priest named Mathias Wernerus built
Holy Ghost Park, popularly known as the <a href="http://www.dickeyvillegrotto.com/grotto.htm">Dickeyville
Grotto</a>. It became a
tourist attraction and largely inspired the rich tradition of sculptural
expression in Wisconsin and around the region.</p>
<p>The series of grottos and shrines is made of concrete embellished with
rose quartz, geodes, petrified wood, colored glass, china and other
treasures that the priest and his parishioners scavenged from around the
nation.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/i/dickeyville_eagle.jpg" alt="Dickeyville Grotto in southwest Wisconsin." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Dickeyville's Grotto inspired a generation of folk artists.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>They topped it off with American flags and eagles, to demonstrate
loyalty to country as well as church.</p>
<p>The Dickeyville Grotto is part of another interesting tour: <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/Wisconsin-folk-art/">Road trip:
Wisconsin's concrete
art</a>.</p>
<h3>Badgers and beer in Potosi</h3>
<p>From Dickeyville, head west to Potosi, where a pockmarked hillside
preserves remnants from the state's earliest days. Across from the St.
John Mine, the Badger Hut Trail leads past outcroppings of dolomite and
limestone — a sign to early prospectors that lead might be nearby —
to two huts.</p>
<p>They're circle-shaped piles of rubble today. But they weren't that
much nicer in the 1830s, when they had sod roofs that leaked on the
miners inside, making them about as grumpy as the mammals for which
they're named.</p>
<p>The state could have a worse nickname: &quot;Badgers&quot; were the miners who
dug in for the winter, but the ones who migrated south were called
&quot;suckers,&quot; after the fish.</p>
<p>Halfway up the opposite hillside is Snake Cave, where it's said local
Indians first showed lead to French explorer Nicolas Perrot around 1690.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>A century later, across the river, the Mesquakie befriended
French-Canadian fur trader Julien Dubuque, who married Potosa, daughter
of a chief, and made a fortune mining lead on their land.</p>
<p>In Potosi, St. John Mine was dug under the floor of Snake Cave in 1840.
Its walls were covered with flowstone, onyx and chert, or flint. But the
miners were looking for something else, using candlelight to catch the
gleam of galena, or lead ore.</p>
<p>Potosi also is a long-time brewing town. The <a href="http://www.potosibrewery.com">Potosi Brewing
Co</a>. started in 1852 and became the
fifth-largest brewery in Wisconsin, in later years producing Holiday,
Garten Bräu and Alpine Lager.</p>
<p>It closed in 1972 but reopened in 2008 and now is run by a foundation.
The restored brewery includes the American Breweriana Association's
National Brewery Museum, the Potosi Brewing Co. Transportation Museum
and the Great River Road Interpretive Center.</p>
<p>There's a handsome
<a href="http://www.potosibrewery.com/restaurant.cfm">restaurant</a> and bar and a
pretty beer garden out back.</p>
<p>And of course, there's freshly made beer: the flagship Good Old Potosi
farmhouse ale as well as Snake Hollow India pale ale, Potosi Pure Malt
Cave ale, half a dozen seasonal brews and, for the kids, Princess Potosa
root beer.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/l/platteville_miner.jpg" alt="Mining Museum in Platteville." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Mannequins portray miners at the Mining Museum in Platteville.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Underground in Platteville</h3>
<p>From Potosi, take Wisconsin 35 north, then County Road B east to
Platteville, where the nation's first mining school was founded in
1907.</p>
<p>In the middle of town, an 1845 lead mine was rediscovered under a
schoolhouse in 1972 and now is part of the Mining Museum, where guides
explain what life was like underground.</p>
<p>Visitors descend 90 steps into the mine and hear a classic get-rich
story: Lorenzo Bevans, having failed at law and shopkeeping, was
bankrupt and living on credit when he asked a prominent mine owner if he
could dig on his land.</p>
<p>He found nothing for months and was about to give up when he hit a vein
that yielded 2 million pounds of ore the first summer. He promptly got
out of the mine business and opened another general store.</p>
<p>It was a wise decision: By the time miners were in their 40s, they
suffered from poor eyesight, bad knees, chronic coughs and, of course,
lead poisoning.</p>
<p>Life-size mannequins portray the men who toiled by candlelight; one of
them is black, representing the slaves who were sent north to work in
Wisconsin mines.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Outside, visit the hoist house, where ore was lifted out of the shaft
and sorted, and ride around the grounds behind a 24-gauge locomotive
that once pulled 1,500-pound ore cans.</p>
<p>Many similar mines lie under the streets of Platteville, the region's
largest town, and until the 1950s, when people sold their houses, they
would maintain the mineral rights.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Mining Trade School grew into UW-Platteville, whose
students created and maintain a 241-foot-tall white &quot;M&quot; on a hill
east of town — the <a href="http://www.roadtripamerica.com/roadside/Wisconsin-Platteville-Worlds-Biggest-M.htm">largest &quot;M&quot; in the
world</a>.</p>
<h3>The forgotten First Capitol</h3>
<p>Off U.S. 151 just east of Platteville, you'll find Belmont. In 1836,
thanks to lead-mine owner Henry Dodge, this village became the first
capital of Wisconsin Territory, which included all of present-day
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and part of the Dakotas.</p>
<p>Today, Belmont barely exists, though the Wisconsin Historical Society
still preserves the two lodging houses into which 39 legislators
squeezed, hammering out a legal and judicial framework in 46 days.</p>
<p>Henry Dodge became the first territorial governor, and Nelson Dewey, who
also became a lead-mine owner when he bought Potosi's St. John Mine,
was the first state governor.</p>
<p>The California Gold Rush soon led to the first bust in the lead-boom
cycle, siphoning off local miners. Then the rest of Wisconsin grew up,
making the state famous for other things: motorcycles, paper, outboard
motors, beer and cheese.</p>
<p>But in this niche of Wisconsin, the landscape still stands testament to
those who took the lead.</p>
