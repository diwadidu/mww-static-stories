<p>The more hectic life becomes, the more we love covered bridges.</p>
<p>They evoke a powerful sense of nostalgia for slower-paced times.
Literally slower: On Minnesota's last span, a sign reads, &quot;$10 Fine
for Driving Faster Than a Walk Across This Bridge.&quot;</p>
<p>Only a few original bridges remain, but others have been reconstructed
or built from scratch, often from salvaged timber. Many of the new
covered bridges are over bicycle trails.</p>
<p>Why were bridges covered? Generally, because roofs protected wooden
decking from the elements.</p>
<p>But they also were used in areas where farmers needed to drive cattle
across the bridge: Cattle were more willing to enter a bridge that
looked like a barn door than a flat, open-air bridge.</p>
<p>Seeking out covered bridges makes a fun excursion on a weekend. Here's
where to find them.</p>

<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p>Wisconsin once had more than 40 covered bridges, but the lattice-truss
<a href="https://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/2241/Covered-Bridge-Park">bridge</a> on the
north edge of
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/cedarburg-wisconsin/">Cedarburg</a></strong> ,
just north of Milwaukee, is the only one that remains. It was built in
1876 and spans Cedar Creek.</p>
<p>The local arts guild holds a <a href="https://www.cedarburgartistsguild.com/coveredbridgeartstudiotour">Covered Bridge Studio
Tour</a>
the second weekend in October, with more than 50 artists in the area
opening their studios.</p>
<p>Fifteen miles east of <em>Fifield</em> , deep in the north woods, the <a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/listing/smith-rapids-covered-bridge/11552/">Smith
Rapids Covered
Bridge</a>
spans the South Fork of the Flambeau River just off Wisconsin 70 on
13-mile <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/tours/rustic-road-105-192949">Rustic Road
105</a>.</p>
<p>It was built in 1991 in the style patented by architect Ithiel Town in
1820 and 1835 as Town's lattice truss. There's a campground on one
end.</p>
<p>Five miles southwest of <em>Fort Atkinson</em> , a very pretty covered bridge
that features a roof with a caboose-style cupola spans a tiny creek that
flows from the southeast corner of Lake Koshkonong.</p>
<p>It was built in 2000 with century-old barn timbers, mostly for the
benefit of bicyclists on the 8½-mile <a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/multi-use-bike-trails/glacial-river-bike-trail-200141">Glacial River
Trail</a>, which parallels Wisconsin 26. Like many covered bridges, it's
popular as a photography spot for wedding parties.</p>

The 1876 bridge in Cedarburg is Wisconsin's last original covered
bridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Three miles north of <em><strong>Brodhead</strong></em> in southern Wisconsin, a replica of
the Clarence covered bridge was built over Norwegian Creek on the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/sugarriver/">Sugar
River State Trail</a> in
1984.</p>
<p>The original crossed the Sugar River two miles south of Brodhead, which
celebrates Covered Bridge Days in early August.</p>
<p>In <strong>Elroy</strong> , an open lattice truss bridge crosses the Baraboo River at
the end of the <a href="http://www.traillink.com/trail/omaha-trail.aspx">Omaha
Trail</a>. It was built
for the state's sesquicentennial in 1998.</p>
<p>Not far from Lake Michigan, the town of <em>Mishicot</em> had a 1925 concrete
bridge over the East Twin River. But in 1995, when the DOT said its
<a href="https://www.mishicot.org/history/pages/rockway-bridge">Rockway Bridge</a>
no longer was safe for traffic, it turned it into a covered walking
bridge.</p>
<p>Pedestrians have other pretty little bridges. Waterfall-watchers will
find one over the Amnicon River in <strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/amnicon/">Amnicon Falls State
Park</a></strong> in the northwest
corner of the state, and bird-watchers have one in the <strong><a href="http://kvr.state.wi.us/">Kickapoo
Valley Reserve</a></strong> near La Farge.</p>
<p>There's also a privately owned covered bridge across the Crystal River
near
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/waupaca-lakes/">Waupaca</a></strong> ,
along County Road K in Little Hope.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/z/u/zumbrota_covered_bridge.jpg" alt="A covered bridge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Minnesota's last original bridge crosses the Zumbro River in Zumbrota.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p>The only remaining covered bridge in Minnesota spans the Zumbro River in
<strong><a href="http://www.ci.zumbrota.mn.us/">Zumbrota</a></strong> , between Cannon Falls and
Rochester off U.S. 52. Finished in 1873, it uses Ithiel Town's
patented lattice truss pattern.</p>
<p>The sign at the entrance reads &quot;$10 Fine for Driving Faster Than a
Walk Across This Bridge.&quot;</p>
<p>It's now part of Covered Bridge Park, and children like to sled from it
down a hill. Here's a charming <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVFd1YwcHww">YouTube
video</a> about the bridge,
built because locals were &quot;trying to create a little bit of New England
out here in Minnesota.&quot;</p>
<p>Two covered bridges have been built for bicyclists. In central
Minnesota, a 12-mile spur of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lake-wobegon-trail/">Lake Wobegon
Trail</a>
heads north to
<a href="https://lakewobegontrail.com/trailheads/#holdingford"><strong>Holdingford</strong></a>, where a bridge crosses the Two Rivers River.</p>
<p>Holdingford, which built the bridge in 2008, now calls itself &quot;Gateway
to Lake Wobegon.&quot;</p>
<p>And south of <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Red
Wing</a></strong> **** ,
there's a small bridge crossing Hay Creek on the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/goodhue_pioneer/index.html">Goodhue Pioneer State
Trail</a>, which eventually will connect Red Wing to Zumbrota and its covered
bridge.</p>

<h3>Iowa</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.madisoncounty.com/the-covered-bridges/">covered bridges of <strong>Madison
County</strong></a>, half an
hour southwest of Des Moines, were immortalized in Robert James
Waller's novel &quot;The Bridges of Madison County.&quot;</p>
<p>The county county once had 19 bridges, but just six remain. Five are
original and were built between 1870 and 1884. The 1883 <a href="http://www.madisoncounty.com/cedar-covered-bridge/">Cedar
Bridge</a> was
destroyed by an arsonist in 2002 and replaced, but it was hit again by
an arsonist in 2017.</p>
<p>Winterset, the county seat, holds the <a href="http://www.madisoncounty.com/covered-bridge-festival/">Madison County Covered Bridge
Festival</a> in
mid-October. Festivities include guided bus tours of the bridges.</p>
<p>Visitors also can see the bridges on their own or with a step-on guide,
$50 for a two-hour tour.</p>
<h3>Northern Illinois</h3>
<p>North of <strong><a href="http://www.visitprinceton-il.com">Princeton</a></strong> on the the
<a href="http://www.illinoisriverroad.org/">Illinois River Road National Scenic
Byway</a>, the 1863 <a href="http://www.enjoyillinois.com/thingstodo/details/6046214">Red Covered
Bridge</a> over
Big Bureau Creek is one of five original covered bridges in Illinois.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/a/parkfalls_bridge_side.jpg" alt="A covered bridge near Park Falls." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Smith Rapids bridge crosses the Flambeau River in north-woods
Wisconsin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On this bridge, a sign on each end reads, &quot;Five dollars fine . . . for
leading any beast faster than a walk on or across this bridge.&quot;</p>
<p>The bridge is in City County Park on Illinois 26, just north of I-80.</p>
<p>A mile west of <em><strong>Princeton</strong></em> , the <a href="http://www.enjoyillinois.com/thingstodo/details/6045924">Captain Swift Covered
Bridge</a> over
Big Bureau Creek was built of wood in 2006. It's open to traffic and is
the only two-lane covered bridge in Illinois.</p>
<p>Ninety miles to the southwest, the <a href="http://www.knoxcountyscenicdrive.com/wolf-covered-bridge.html">Wolf Covered
Bridge</a>
is 15 miles southeast of <strong>Galesburg</strong> , just east of the tiny hamlet of
Gilson. The 1874 bridge was destroyed by fire in 1994 and replaced in
1999.</p>
<p>The bridge is a stop on the <a href="http://www.knoxcountyscenicdrive.com/">Knox County Scenic
Drive</a>, held the first two full
weekends of October.</p>
<p>Thirty miles west of Galesburg, the 1866 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oquawka_Wagon_Bridge">Oquawka Wagon
Bridge</a> is along the
Mississippi River two miles south of <em>Oquawka</em> . It was washed away by a
flood in 1982, but reconstructed with most of its original timbers.</p>
<p>Two bridges are in south-central Illinois. The 1880 <a href="https://sangamoncountyhistory.org/wp/?p=1144">Sugar Creek Covered
Bridge</a> is just south of
<strong>Springfield</strong> , off historic Route 66. South of <strong>Shelbyville</strong> , the
1868 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_Mill_Covered_Bridge">Thompson Mill Covered
Bridge</a>
crosses the Kaskaskia River.</p>
<p>Across the Mississippi River from Ste. Genevieve, Mo., the <a href="http://www.chesterill.com/recreation/historical-sites/marys-covered-bridge">Mary's
River Covered
Bridge</a>
was built in 1854 in the bluffs east of <strong>Chester</strong> .</p>
<h3>Western Michigan</h3>
<p>On the 34½-mile <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kal-Haven_Trail">Kal-Haven
Trail</a> from Kalamazoo,
there's a <a href="http://www.michigan.org/property/donald-f-nichols-covered-bridge/">covered
bridge</a>
near the western trailhead, in South Haven.</p>
