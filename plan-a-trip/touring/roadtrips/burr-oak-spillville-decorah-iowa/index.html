<p>There's something inspiring about a certain pocket of northeast Iowa.</p>
<p>It's nurtured a a beloved children's-book author, a famous composer
and two brilliant woodcarvers. It's stirred battalions of people who
create art, preserve heirloom seed and carry on Norwegian culture.</p>
<p>There are a lot of stories in these hills and valleys on the edge of the
Driftless Area, which escaped the flattening effects of the glaciers.</p>
<p>In Burr Oak, Laura Ingalls Wilder spent a year far from the prairie. Pa
managed a hotel and saloon, Ma emptied chamberpots and 9-year-old Laura
sought peace and quiet in the cemetery.</p>
<p>They were so poor the doctor's wife tried to adopt Laura; after the
hotel owner's son put a bullet through the door while attacking his
wife, the family fled, their debts unpaid.</p>
<p>On the ridges around Decorah, Diane and Kent Whealy began propagating
morning glories and tomatoes from seeds her great-grandparents brought
from Bavaria in the 1870s.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They founded Seed Savers Exchange to preserve and share heirloom seeds,
and now thousands visit the gardens and orchards of its 890-acre
Heritage Farm.</p>
<p>Decorah thrived on an influx of Norwegians. They founded Luther College
in 1861 and Vesterheim, their &quot;home in the west,&quot; in 1877.</p>
<p>It's now the nation's largest museum dedicated to a single immigrant
group. Artists and musicians gravitated to the picturesque town and made
it a center of culture.</p>
<p>Genius found a foothold in Spillville, where Antonin Dvorak spent the
summer of 1893 writing his &quot;American&quot; String Quartet. On a farm, Frank
and Joseph Bily spent three decades sculpting musical clocks, one of
which Henry Ford tried, and failed, to buy for $1 million.</p>
<p>This is Iowa, but it's not flat, and it's not dull. Little more than
two hours from the Twin Cities, it's fertile ground for exploration.</p>
<p>The scenery starts just south of Rochester, where outcrops of golden
limestone start to jut from roadsides. The Amish settled here, and when
my husband and I passed through Canton one fall, we stopped to stock up
on the cashew crunch, baked goods and jams that Amish women sell from
their buggies.</p>

The year the Ingalls family spent in Burr Oak, Iowa, didn't make it
into Laura's books, but pilgrims still want to see where the family
lived.

<h3>Burr Oak: bad memories for Laura</h3>
<p>Burr Oak is only a few minutes away, just across the state border. In
1876, the stagecoach and wagon crossroads already was starting to fade,
but it was a town, and the Ingalls family, including future author
Laura, was uncomfortable there.</p>
<p>Laura's beloved Pa already had failed twice, moving from the Big Woods
near Pepin to eastern Kansas, where he built a house on land he didn't
own, then back to Wisconsin and west to Walnut Grove, Minn., where a
grasshopper invasion was in progress.</p>
<p>Then they traveled to Burr Oak, where Pa helped manage the 1856 Masters
Hotel; along the way, Laura's infant brother Freddie died.</p>
<p>Today, the hotel is the Laura Ingalls Wilder Park and Museum. It shows
several of her possessions - plus a suit worn by her teacher and many
items like those she mentioned in her books, including wooden butter
molds, twists of slough grass used for heating and a three-footed
&quot;spider&quot; kettle.</p>
<p>There's a copy of the test she had to take to become a teacher and a
copy of her unpublished autobiography &quot;Pioneer Girl,&quot; which does
mention Burr Oak.</p>
<p>And there's a photo of Mrs. Eunice Hall Starr, the doctor's wife who
tried to adopt Laura and give her a better life.</p>
<p>The books paint a rosy picture of life on the frontier, and it was even
rosier in the hit TV series &quot;Little House on the Prairie.&quot; So the many
people who follow the Laura Ingalls Wilder route around the Midwest
often are surprised to see that reality for the Ingallses was much
harsher.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;I love all kinds of pioneer stories, but I don't think I would have
made a very good pioneer,&quot; said Arlene Schoeneck of Shakopee, Minn.,
who was touring the Master's Hotel with her husband, Don.</p>
<p>After the disastrous year in Burr Oak, often called &quot;the missing link&quot;
because Laura never wrote about it in her &quot;Little House&quot; books, the
family returned to Walnut Grove, then moved on to De Smet, S.D.</p>
<h3>Rural Decorah: heirloom seeds</h3>
<p>Not far down U.S. 52, immigrants from Germany and Norway were working
farms on the ridges and valleys around Decorah.</p>
<p>A century later, their great-grandchildren realized many of their
vegetables and fruits were disappearing, and they began to collect the
seeds and share them with other gardeners.</p>
<p>Today, Seed Savers Exchange preserves more than 25,000 endangered
varieties at its 890-acre Heritage Farm, where visitors can hike on
trails, tour gardens and buy heirloom seeds and garden gifts at the
visitors center.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_seed_fest.jpg" alt="Pumpkin rolling at Seed Savers." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Seed Savers' fall festival, children roll pumpkins down the hill.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The center's displays and the racks of colorful seed packets are eye
candy for adventurous gardeners like Mary Lewman-Stork of Carroll, Iowa,
who picks something new every year.</p>
<p>This year, she grew fat snake gourds that grew off the trellis, hit the
ground and started growing back up; next year, she plans to grow
prehistoric-looking dinosaur gourds and bulé gourds that look like giant
wart-covered apples.</p>
<p>&quot;I grow them just to amaze my friends,&quot; she said. &quot;I like to keep
them guessing about what I'm going to grow next.&quot;</p>
<p>Megan Rutter of rural Canton has an heirloom apple and pear orchard and
was at Seed Savers looking for melon seeds. She's a frequent visitor,
she said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's addictive, seeds are addictive,&quot; she said. &quot;The pictures are
bad — I see them and say, 'Oh, I want to grow that.'&quot;</p>
<p>It was easy to catch the bug. On the spot, we decided to plant an
ornamental vegetable garden, so Rutter helped us pick out purple basil,
purple-and-white striped beans, golden beets, sweet marjoram with white
flowers and a pink-and-orange Swiss chard called Five-Color Silverbeet.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_vesterheim_water_street.jpg" alt="Vesterheim anchors Water Street in Decorah" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Norwegian immigrants.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/decorah-iowa-norwegian-heritage/">Decorah</a> : Norwegian heritage</h3>
<p>Norwegians settled Decorah, and their cultural center is Westerheim, or
&quot;home in the west.&quot;</p>
<p>The museum on Water Street was founded even as Norwegian immigration to
America was peaking. It now occupies nearly a square block and includes
a stone mill, a church, a school, a blacksmith shop and several houses,
including one brought from Norway.</p>
<p>People come from all over to see the exhibits, listen to lectures and
take classes from renowned artists who have elevated rural folk crafts
to high art.</p>
<p>There were intricately painted ale cups and porridge boxes, chip-carved
plates, knifes with tooled-leather sheaths, a triangular birch hat box
with burnt decor and ironwork latches - practical items, but all so
lovely.</p>
<p>&quot;I think in cold, dark Norway, to make every day beautiful, that was
something special,&quot; said Joan Leuenberger, controller at Vesterheim.</p>
<h3>Spillville: Dvorak and two inspired woodcarvers</h3>
<p>Only 15 minutes from Decorah, two self-taught bachelor farmers were
creating beauty of their own. They spent long winters carving fantastic
clocks - more accurately, huge wooden scenes packed with moving
figures, with a time-keeping mechanism attached.</p>
<p>At first, they carved lacy Gothic-style clocks reminiscent of European
cathedrals; their 1915-16 Apostles Clock featured the 12 apostles
parading over a panel of Prague, where their parents were born.</p>
<p>But within a decade, Frank and Joseph Bily had forged a distinct
American style, often using the warm gold butternut wood found on their
farm.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spillville_bily_clocks.jpg" alt="Bily Clocks in Spillville." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Bily brothers' clocks fill a museum in Spillville.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Their American Pioneer History Clock plays &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; and
features 57 historical figures; they were asked to take it to the 1933
Chicago World's Fair and refused. Henry Ford offered $1 million for
it, and they refused.</p>
<p>They made a Travel Clock, with relief carvings of Viking ships and
zeppelins; a Statuary Clock, with such heroes as Kant, Michelangelo,
Ibsen, Zebulon Pike and Pioneer Women; and the Village Blacksmith Clock,
inspired by Longfellow's poem of the same name.</p>
<p>All of the carvings came from pictures they found in books or on
postcards, including the Little Brown Church of the Vale in nearby
Nashua.</p>
<p>&quot;They never traveled more than 35 miles from home, and the Little Brown
Church was 40 miles away,&quot; said guide Ray Oblander.</p>
<p>Tourists beat a path to their door, and the brothers showed the clocks
for a fee of 10 cents. They never sold any of them, planning to leave
them to their unmarried sister for her care after their deaths.</p>
<p>&quot;But she died first, and they were so upset they were going to burn the
clocks,&quot; said guide Adella Kuhn. &quot;Luckily, their neighbors talked them
out of it.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Tours of the Bily Clocks Exhibit are accompanied by the music of Antonin
Dvorak, who lived in the brick building in 1893. The upstairs floor is
devoted to the Czech composer, who came to New York to head the National
Conservatory for two years but missed his homeland.</p>
<p>After listening to his assistant's stories of growing up in Spillville,
he decided to take his family there for the summer.</p>
<p>&quot;The teacher and parish priest and everything is Czech, and so I shall
be among my own folk,&quot; he wrote. &quot;How good it will be.&quot;</p>
<p>He got up at 4 each morning and walked along the Turkey River, listening
to the birds; the song of the scarlet tanager became part of his
&quot;American&quot; string quartet, written in Spillville. He went fishing with
local boys, played cards with old-timers and played organ for the 7 a.m.
mass at St. Wenceslaus.</p>
<p>He listened avidly to the music of Kickapoo Indians who came to perform
a medicine show; that, too, appeared in his quartet. And when Dvorak
later wrote his famous &quot;New World&quot; symphony, the little Czech village
in Iowa became part of music history.</p>
<p>This rolling landscape has inspired a remarkable array of people over
the years. Today, tourists are reaping the rewards.</p>
