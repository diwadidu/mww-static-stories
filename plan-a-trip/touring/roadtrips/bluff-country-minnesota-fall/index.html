<p>At harvest time, Minnesota's bluff country overflows with beauty.</p>
<p>Fat pumpkins await buyers at farmers' markets. Golden clumps of
wildflowers line bicycle trails. From buggies, the Amish sell homemade
baskets, bumbleberry jam and apple butter.</p>
<p>There's an abundance of everything, including tourists.</p>
<p>The ridges and valleys of southeast Minnesota are a natural destination
for travelers, and the picturesque stretch of Minnesota 16 along the
Root River is a national scenic byway.</p>
<p>You see all kinds of things in bluff country. Wild turkeys weave across
bicycle trails and rattlesnakes sunbathe on the asphalt. Alert motorists
may spot a goat farm painted purple or a potbellied troll with blue
fingernails.</p>
<p>Tucked into a bowl surrounded by limestone bluffs, <em>Lanesboro</em> is the
bicycling hub. <em>Harmony</em> is surrounded by Amish farms and is at one end
of a bicycle trail that follows Camp Creek down into <em>Preston</em> , home of
two apple orchards.</p>

<p>To the east, <em>Spring Grove</em> is an enclave of Norwegians. Farther on, not
far from the Mississippi, grindstones still turn at an 1876 grist mill.</p>
<p>In between, the forks and branches of the Root River and its tributaries
create glades and dales known only to trout fishermen and morel-mushroom
hunters.</p>
<p>In the fall, this area begs for a road trip, and that's what I did one
October. Lanesboro was holding its fall festival, and at the Sons of
Norway Hall, I filled up a box at the annual Old-Fashioned Cookie Walk.</p>
<p>From two Amish families at the weekly farmers' market in Sylvan Park, I
bought the season's first cashew crunch.</p>
<p>From Lanesboro, Minnesota 16 continues toward Harmony past Inspiration
Point, a good place for a picnic. But this time, I went straight south
on County Road 21, an even lovelier road that follows the rolling spine
of a ridge past Amish farms.</p>
<p>In <em>Canton</em> , an Amish woman had parked her buggy in front of a gift
shop, and I bought blackberry jam and a pair of potholders, plus more
cashew crunch. Her sister had made the addictive toffee, said the
soft-spoken vendor: &quot;I like it, too. You can't leave it alone.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spring_grove_ola_per_fall.jpg" alt="Ola and Per in Spring Grove." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Ola and Per, the beloved stars of a popular Norwegian comic strip, are
immortalized in Spring Grove.

<h3>Into the land of Norwegians</h3>
<p>Heading east, I came to Spring Grove, the first Norwegian settlement in
Minnesota. It's the home of Spring Grove soda, bottled since 1895 and
still made with cane sugar; its labels bear the slogan &quot;Mange Tusen
Takk!&quot; Norwegian for &quot;Thanks a million.&quot;</p>
<p>Spring Grove is serious about its heritage; in the town park, there's a
heroic bronze Viking, dedicated to ancestors &quot;who started here with so
little that we might have everything,&quot; and two smaller bronze figures,
one holding a wrench and one a pitchfork.</p>
<p>They're Ola and Per, who appeared in a nationally beloved comic strip
written by Spring Grove native Peter Rosendahl between 1918 and 1942 for
the Decorah Posten; the pair's bumbling misadventures illustrated the
bumpy path undertaken by Norwegian immigrants.</p>
<p>Across the park are three even goofier figures, Tovar the Terrible, a
12-foot Viking; a troll with a &quot;Belly by Budweiser&quot; banner draped
across its bulbous brown stomach; and a Norwegian farmer.</p>
<p>Spring Grove still is 90 percent Norwegian, though it &quot;used to be 99.9
percent,&quot; said Howard Burtness, who caught me looking at the figures.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He said his own family emigrated to Spring Grove from Norway in 1848,
and he himself returns every year from his winter home in San
Bernardino, Calif.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm drawn to it, like the swallows of San Capistrano,&quot; he said of
the town. &quot;It's sheer instinct. I like to rub elbows with members of
my common gene pool.&quot;</p>
<p>From the park, I walked over to two of my favorite shops, Ballard House
Antiques, where I found an old Nativity set hand-painted in Italy, and
HIS Business, which carries beautifully crafted goods made by local
artisans - mohair sweaters and mittens, solid cherry and walnut tables
and chests.</p>
<p>And of course I stopped at the IGA for sodas - creamy orange, black
cherry, root beer, strawberry, grape, cream and my favorite, lemon sour.</p>
<h3>Relic of the past</h3>
<p>West of Caledonia, at <em>Beaver Creek Valley State Park</em> , I crossed a
suspension bridge to hike along a paved path. At the edge of the park,
on Beaver Creek, I stopped at Schech's Mill, so quaint it looks like a
re-creation. But it's the 1876 original, now the state's oldest
water-powered mill still in use.</p>
<p>I followed twisting Badger Creek into <em>Houston</em> , the eastern trailhead
of the Root River State Trail and the home of the Houston Nature Center,
sprinkled with recycled-bicycle sculptures.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanesboro_amish_buggy.jpg" alt="An Amish horse and buggy waits at the Lanesboro farmers mark" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In fall, pumpkins go fast at the farmers market in Lanesboro's Sylvan
Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The town is relishing its heightened profile on the popular trail, and
it has reason to be proud: The eight up-and-down miles into Houston,
which sits at the brink of coulee country, are the most fun to ride on
the whole trail.</p>
<p>Minnesota 16 winds back to Lanesboro past <em>Rushford</em> , a market town,
and <em>Whalan</em> , famous for its pie shop. Lanesboro has been spiffing up
Parkway Avenue, which now includes the Commonweal Theatre's new
building.</p>
<p>When I was in Lanesboro, I missed the play, but I did make a ritual
visit to the Lanesboro Arts Center, which shows the work of regional
artists. Many artists have migrated to the picturesque ridges and
valleys between Lanesboro and Decorah.</p>
<p>Some of the finest wood furniture can be found in <em>Harmony</em> at R &amp; J
Wood Crafts, owned by Jake and Reuben Hershberger, who grew up among the
14 children of the local Amish bishop.</p>
<p>On that trip, I ordered two solid-cherry Mission-style end tables from
Mary Hershberger, whose softly rounded syllables belied her uncovered
blond curls and purple Columbia ski jacket.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;A lot of people pick up on my accent and ask if I'm Amish,&quot; she
said, smiling patiently. &quot;I used to be.&quot;</p>
<p>My last stop was a mile east of Harmony, where Ada Austin raised angora
goats and lavished a gallon of purple paint on her farm each year, until
her death in 2012 at age 73.</p>
<p>&quot;On my 50th birthday, someone gave me the book, 'When I Am an Old
Woman I Shall Wear Purple,' and it became my old-lady bible,&quot; she
said.</p>
<p>The farm shop where Austin sold mohair clothing and gifts has closed,
but her daughters still sell items online.</p>
<p>Like so much of bluff country, Austin and her purple farm broke the
mold.</p>
<p>That's why the area is so fun to explore: You never know what you'll
see there.</p>
