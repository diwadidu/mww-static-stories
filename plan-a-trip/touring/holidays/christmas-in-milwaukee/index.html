<h2>During the holidays, this city shimmers like Cinderella.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_tree_red.jpg" alt="Cathedral Square at Christmas." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Christmas, luminaries and "trees" made of red, white and green
lights make Cathedral Square glow.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>No one ever accused Milwaukee of being flashy.</p>
<p>Best known for tractors, motorcycles and beer, it's a meat-and-potatoes
kind of town, stolid and practical like the Germans who built it.</p>
<p>It's not what you'd call a trendy destination. And yet every time I go
there, I have a great time.</p>
<p>The ugly duckling has turned into a swan. Consider its landmarks ‐ a
bright-white &quot;wing,&quot; whose graceful unfurling draws sightseers to the
Milwaukee Art Museum, and the sliding roof of Miller Park, which tucks
itself in to a musical fanfare after Brewers games.</p>
<p>And at night, this gray lady has a face that lights up like a kid in a
candy shop.</p>
<p>One December, my husband and I arrived in Milwaukee's Third Ward just as
Christmas celebrations were getting under way. Red and green rockets
exploded over Catalano Square, showering us with slivers of light, and
draft horses pulled carriages through the streets.</p>
<p>Once an Irish neighborhood, the Third Ward turned into a working-class
Italian neighborhood after an 1892 fire wiped out 16 square blocks.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Shops, restaurants, theaters and museums now fill the neighborhood,
which adjoins downtown, and developers are turning the cream-brick
warehouses into condos and lofts. It's also the home of the Milwaukee
Public Market, the local version of Seattle's Pike Place Market.</p>
<p>From the square, we walked to the Broadway Theatre Center and bought
tickets to Skylight Opera Theatre's &quot;The Christmas Schooner.&quot;</p>
<p>In the Cabot Theatre, we felt as if we were inside a Faberge egg, seated
above a little main stage in one of three galleries adorned with sconces
and trompe l'oeil woodwork, under a sky filled with angels and cherubim.</p>
<p>Then we were transported to Christmas Eve 1881, in the home of one of
the German &quot;Christmas-tree ship&quot; captains who braved Lake Michigan in
winter to deliver evergreens to nostalgic German immigrants in Chicago.</p>
<p>It's set in Manistique, Mich., but as the family sang &quot;O Tannenbaum,&quot;
and received a visit from the can-rattling Mummers, it seemed like
Milwaukee, where Germans arrived first and sank deep roots.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_third_ward_christmas.jpg" alt="Christmas in Milwaukee's Third Ward." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In the Third Ward, a cart sells popcorn as children wait to see Santa in
the Gingerbread House.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From the theater, we walked over to one of three dozen Third Ward
restaurants, this one with exposed cream-brick walls, long banquettes
and a wood-burning fireplace stretched behind a glass garage door.</p>
<p>Next to us, 12 fashion-merchandising students from New York City told us
they'd had a &quot;New York-quality dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>Our inn, the County Clare, was on the other side of downtown, not far
from the lakefront bluff. A Celtic-folk trio was playing in the Irish
pub, where we ate corned-beef hash the next morning as the staff trimmed
a Christmas tree.</p>
<p>From there, we drove across the Milwaukee River to Old World Third
Street. It's the remnant of the old German downtown, and its shops and
turreted landmark restaurant, Mader's, are repositories of Old World
flavors.</p>
<p>At Usinger's Famous Sausage, a line of customers waited patiently under
turn-of-the-century murals of happy elves chasing cattle and pigs.
Banners in German read, &quot;Ham, sausage and pig stomach delight every
German,&quot; and &quot;Yankees and French also love these German things.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Pig stomach doesn't sound delightful, but it's the favorite dish of
former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who visited Milwaukee in 1996 with
former President Bill Clinton, who called it &quot;America's most
German-American city.&quot;</p>
<p>We stocked up on European-style cheeses at the Wisconsin Cheese Mart.
And at the Spice House, we bought Ecuadorean peppercorns, saffron and
tiny tubs of veal and seafood demiglace.</p>
<p>Across the river, we spied new townhouses, each with a dock, and the
former Blatz brewery, advertising &quot;gracious living&quot; in apartments; as
in Chicago and Minneapolis, empty-nesters from the suburbs are flocking
back downtown.</p>
<p>On the west edge of downtown, we toured the gabled Pabst Mansion, an
1892 Flemish Renaissance Revival near the campus of Marquette
University. Once, Wisconsin Avenue was lined with mansions, and over
time, they were torn down.</p>
<p>Even Captain Frederick Pabst's house, the home of Milwaukee's
archbishops from 1908 to 1975, came within 10 days of being torn down
for a parking lot.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_beer_monk.jpg" alt="Mader's sign in Milwaukee." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was decorated for the holidays, its intricate woodwork festooned with
red-velvet ribbons, frosted roses and gilded pinecones. During the
1890s, Pabst became the world's largest producer of lager beer, though
Schlitz, Blatz and Miller also contributed to the town's reputation as
the beer capital of the world.</p>
<p>Today, only Miller remains, bought in 2002 by South African Breweries,
which merged with Coors and became SABMiller, then MillerCoors.</p>
<p>From the Pabst Mansion, we went downtown and split a sampler of German
delicacies at one of the city's famous German restaurants.</p>
<p>Skaters were circling the rink in Red Arrow Park, and the streets were
filled with people, going to see &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; at the Pabst
Theater and the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra at the Marcus Center.</p>
<p>Milwaukee is prettiest at night, when spotlights bathe the copper
cupolas, domes and gables atop downtown roofs and lights twinkle on
pedestrian bridges across the river.</p>
<p>It's at its best during the Holiday Lights Festival, when holiday
figures shine in Pere Marquette Park, buildings are strung with lights
and luminaries line sidewalks.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From downtown, we headed north along Lake Drive, hugging Lake Michigan
as we drove up to Shorewood and Whitefish Bay, where Captain Pabst
opened the Whitefish Bay Resort in 1889.</p>
<p>Our route, popular with sightseers since horse-and-buggy days, was lined
with brick and half-timbered mansions, some as big as hotels.</p>
<p>Long ago, Milwaukee's prospects rivaled Chicago's. But Chicago became
the great city, and Milwaukee, locals say, has had an inferiority
complex ever since.</p>
<p>But today, Milwaukee has all the big-city attractions, but none of the
pretension or high prices. You can drive there, park for nothing and
walk everywhere, from river to lake. It's gemütlich — pleasant, cozy,
easygoing.</p>
<p>It is what it is — and for a tourist, that's a pleasure.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Milwaukee at Christmas</h3>
<p><em>Getting around:</em> It's fairly easy to park for free, though downtown
