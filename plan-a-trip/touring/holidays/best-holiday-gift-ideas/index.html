<p>It's easy to give people more of the nice stuff they already have:
sweaters, compact discs, fancy soaps.</p>
<p>But how about giving them a good time, instead? Memories, we've found,
last much longer than material goods.</p>
<p>This season might be a good time to open some doors for family and
friends by bestowing passes, kits, experiences and other gifts they can
use year-round.</p>
<p>Here are 10 great gift ideas for people who like to travel — and you
can buy everything online.</p>
<h3>State-park passes</h3>
<p>The best gift, we think, is to give someone a pass for the state they
<em>don't</em> live in.</p>
<p>Wisconsin charges non-residents extra, so that makes its $38
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/admission.html">state-parks pass</a>
something of a luxury for people in surrounding states.</p>
<p>The annual pass is only $25 for <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/index.html">Minnesota state
parks</a>, which sell a
handy <a href="http://www.stayatmnparks.com/GiftCardSale.aspx?utm_sourc">gift
card</a> that
comes in any amount and can be used for vehicle permits as well as
campsites, cabins, rentals, greens fees, tours and gift-shop items.</p>
<p>In Michigan, out-of-state visitors pay $31.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Trail passes</h3>
<p>Wisconsin requires a daily pass to use its bicycle and ski trails, and
it's pesky to find a place to buy them. That makes the $25 annual
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/trailpass.html">trails pass</a> a nice
gift.</p>
<p>Minnesota doesn't charge bicyclists, but it does charge cross-country
skiers. Give a $55 three-year <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/licenses/skipass/index.html">Minnesota Ski
Pass</a>, and your
happy recipient can ski worry-free for quite a while.</p>
<p>And if you know someone who likes to ski around the Twin Cities, you can
give a <a href="http://www.threeriversparks.org/activities/passes/cross-country-skiing.aspx">Three Rivers
Parks</a>
pass for $50, $75 for a couple.</p>
<h3>Historical-society memberships</h3>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to waltz into your
favorite fort or lighthouse any time you feel like it? And during the
holidays, historical societies offer gift memberships at a discount.</p>
<p>Join the <a href="http://sites.mnhs.org/support/membership">Minnesota Historical
Society</a>, and you get free
admission to all the sites for a year. A membership for one and a guest
is regularly $69.</p>
<p>It doesn't take long for a membership to pay for itself. Members also
get discounts on classes, workshops and gift-store items.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Historical Society family
<a href="http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/membership/">membership</a> is regularly
$85.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/i/filtron.jpg" alt="Filtron coffee brewing kit." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Homemade cold-filtered coffee concentrate travels well.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Coffee for travel</h3>
<p>Is there a coffee snob on your list?</p>
<p>The one item that I never travel without is homemade cold-filtered
coffee concentrate. I first tasted it at a B&amp;B in Wisconsin, asked for
the brewing kit for Christmas and haven't gone a day without it since.</p>
<p>It's great for travel (especially camping and backpacking), because 4
ounces, carried in a small Nalgene bottle, is enough to make two
10-ounce mugs, and it doesn't need to be refrigerated.</p>
<p>The coffee it makes is much richer than the regular kind, and much less
bitter because it's never boiled. It has seriously improved my life —
and made me a lot of friends when I've shared.</p>
<p>You could make it yourself, but that would be messy. I use the $39.95
<a href="http://www.filtron.com/">Filtron</a> kit, which includes a flask that
holds 50 ounces, the amount of concentrate you'll get by steeping a
pound of beans. Shipping is free through the end of the year.</p>
<p>If you don't want to make coffee concentrate, Trader Joe's sells it.</p>
<p>To take your coffee on the road, you'll also need a small hot pot to
boil water; look for one with a built-in mug.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Thrills and fun experiences</h3>
<p>A lot of people get to go skydiving, race-car driving and Segway-gliding
thanks to half-price deals that made these things affordable to the
average person.</p>
<p>You could buy a gift certificate for each experience, but gift
certificates are tricky —just because <em>you</em> think something
sounds fun doesn't mean the recipient will.</p>
<p>So why not buy a <a href="http://www.groupon.com/giftcards">Groupon gift card</a> ?
That way, your money goes farther, and anyone who doesn't want a
hot-air balloon ride can use your dime to go out to eat or get a massage
instead. <a href="http://www.livingsocial.com/gifts">Living Social</a> sells gift
cards, too.</p>
<h3>Magazines</h3>
<p>I've always liked magazines because they arrive all year long.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lakesuperiormagazine.com/cat/lsm.html">Lake Superior
magazine</a> out of
Duluth has a good finger on the pulse of the region, and a $24.95
annual subscription includes the annual Travel Guide, essential for
anyone planning a <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/circle-tour-lake-superior/">Circle
Tour</a>.</p>
<p>And if you know someone who likes to travel to Chicago, a $12
subscription to <a href="http://www.chicagomag.com/">Chicago magazine</a> will keep
'em up on the latest news about restaurants, sports, shopping and the
arts.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/beth_warm_clothes.jpg" alt="The ultimate in winter clothing." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Here's how to stay warm at the lowest temperatures: with a neoprene
face mask with fleece hat under down hood, goose-down jacket, down bib
pants and moosehide mukluks.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Warm clothes</h3>
<p>If you want someone to have warm and fuzzy feelings about you, buy
something that will keep her (or him) warm when temperatures drop.</p>
<p>A mere $8 buys a pair of wool socks, but if you have $250, go for the
moosehide mukluks. If you have a medium-size budget, you can get a set
of Thermaskin long underwear from <a href="http://www.landsend.com/">Lands'
End</a> for $59, but they're often 30 or 40
percent off.</p>
<p>For a buying guide, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/warm-winter-clothes/">Staying snug in
winter</a>.</p>
<h3>Packable and reusable dishes</h3>
<p>At motel breakfast buffets, most of us have been disgusted by the trash
cans overflowing with Styrofoam and plastic. You can end the waste, on
your end, anyway, by traveling with reusable dishes from
<a href="http://www.reuseit.com/">ReUseIt.com</a>.</p>
<p>You can also buy them at any camping or outdoors store.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/microspikes.jpg" alt="A set of ice grippers that really works." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Kahtoola Microspikes aren't cheap, but they really grip the ice and
don't fall off.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Outdoors gear</h3>
<p>You can go crazy in this category, spending hundreds on skis, snowshoes
and snowboards.</p>
<p>But everyone does more walking than skiing or snowshoeing, so buy
something that will keep your friend or sweetie upright in slippery
conditions. <a href="http://www.yaktrax.com/Products">
</a></p>
<p>A pair of good ice cleats means you can hike without worry. They're not
cheap, so they make a good gift.</p>
<p>We like <a href="http://kahtoola.com/product/microspikes/">Kahtoola Microspikes</a>, about $55. There's nothing micro about them, which is why they work
so well.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/ice-hiking-crampons-grippers/">Walking on
ice</a>.</p>
<h3>Guidebooks</h3>
<p>There are great books for every kind of destination and every type of
recreation.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But if you know someone who loves wildflowers and road trips, buy a
guide to Minnesota or Wisconsin state natural areas. All of these
low-profile preserves protect something special, often rare plants.</p>
<p>You really need maps to find them, and you can download them online, but
it's handier to keep the books in the glove compartment.</p>
<p>&quot; <a href="http://www.comm.media.state.mn.us/bookstore/mnbookstore.asp?page=viewbook&amp;BookID=68459&amp;stocknum=269">A Guide to Minnesota's Scientific and Natural
Areas</a>
&quot; is $14.95 and describes all of the SNAs.</p>
<p>&quot;Wisconsin, Naturally&quot; includes a statewide map and descriptions for
150 <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/lands/naturalareas/">Wisconsin SNAs</a>. It's
$15 plus $3 shipping.</p>
<p>You'll also benefit by having <a href="http://shop.delorme.com/OA_HTML/DELibeCCtpSctDspRte.jsp?section=10042&amp;minisite=10020">DeLorme Atlas &amp;
Gazetteers</a>, super-detailed maps of each state. In fact, I never go anywhere
without them. They're $19.95 and available at bookstores, sporting
goods stores and Target.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/a/parfreys_glen3.jpg" alt="Parfrey's Glen in Wisconsin." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Just north of Madison, Parfrey's Glen was Wisconsin's first state
natural area.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Conservation-group memberships</h3>
<p>If you're buying a gift for someone who has everything and wants to
give some back, consider a membership in one of the organizations that
preserve our natural spaces.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://my.nature.org/gifts/gift-membership.html">Nature
Conservancy</a> has
chapters in every state and owns many of the state natural areas we can
visit. You can buy a gift membership, which comes with a quarterly
magazine, for as little as $10.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tpl.org">Trust for Public Land</a> plays a critical role in
preserving irreplaceable pieces of land for the public — it buys them
and holds them until governmental units can afford them.</p>
<p>Example: The harbor-front park in Grand Marais, Minn. You can donate in
any amount.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, the <a href="http://www.parksandtrails.org">Parks &amp; Trails Council of
Minnesota</a> has had a hand in creating,
protecting and augmenting many state parks, including Afton, Whitewater
and Split Rock. A membership of $25 or more includes a subscription to
the quarterly Minnesota Trails magazine.</p>
<p>There are many land trusts and conservancies in every state. For more,
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/preserve/">A present to the
future</a>.</p>
