<p>Of all the Great Lakes, Superior is the drama queen.</p>
<p>It's unpredictable and petulant, throwing tantrums that threaten to
swallow any boat that ventures onto its waters. In 1975, it famously
swallowed a boat that itself was called Queen of the Lakes.</p>
<p>Superior loves irony. The first recorded wreck, in 1816, was called the
Invincible.</p>
<p>Everything about this lake is big and muscular. Volcanoes formed its
shores, and hardened lava holds up dozens of waterfalls, except where
giant dunes rise like shifting mountains.</p>
<p>It's fed by more than 200 rivers, which give it enough volume to cover
all of North and South America with a foot of water. Its surface area is
equal to Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and New
Hampshire combined.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The Atlantic Ocean often is called the big pond. But Superior never is
called anything so domestic — except teakettle, which always is paired
with &quot;tempest.&quot;</p>
<p>We adore this Great Lake. We can hardly stay away from it. It's
beautiful, of course. And as our lifestyles become more sedentary, the
lives of the first people on Superior — the explorers, the voyageurs,
the lighthouse keepers and sailors — look that much more colorful and
romantic.</p>
<p>Every year, thousands of people give the lake a big hug, following 1,300
miles of shoreline on the Circle Tour of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Many stop to tour every lighthouse, see every waterfall and catch as
many festivals as possible. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/plan-circle-tour-lake-superior/">Planning a Circle
Tour</a>.</p>
<p>Some only have a week off work to do it. For Circle Tour highlights on
an eight-night, nine-day itinerary, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/lake-superior-circle-tour-highlights/">Lake Superior's greatest
hits</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wawa_goose.jpg" alt="The giant Canada goose in Wawa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The world's largest Canada goose lives in Wawa, which means wild goose
in Ojibwe.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Others have time to paddle out to islands and hike atop cliffs. Some
photograph <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/giant-statues-lake-superior/">giant mascots and figures</a>
and learn their stories — Winnie-the-Pooh in White River, the goose in
Wawa, Father Baraga in L'Anse, Terry Fox in Thunder Bay.</p>
<p>Nearly everyone stops at the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum in Whitefish
Point. Everyone should stop at Historic Fort William in Thunder Bay, a
Disneyland of the fur trade.</p>
<p>But the Circle Tour also is for wanderers, for people who want to run
beach pebbles through their fingers and swim in secluded coves and stop
at kitschy roadside gift shops.</p>
<p>There's no wrong way to drive it, except too fast.</p>
<h3>Heading east</h3>
<p>The first time, I drove the Circle Tour clockwise in late June,
celebrating Canada Day in Sault Ste. Marie in Ontario and the Fourth of July on
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/madeline-island-wisconsin/">Madeline Island</a> in Wisconsin.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/i/big_bay_lighthouse_view.jpg" alt="Guests at Big Bay lighthouse admire the view." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Marquette, guests at Big Bay Lighthouse admire the view of Lake
Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The next time, my husband and I drove it counterclockwise in late July,
starting in <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/best-duluth-minnesota/"><strong>Duluth</strong></a> and making our
first stop
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/bayfield-summer-wisconsin/">Bayfield</a>,</strong> so we could see Big Top Chautauqua's musical revue &quot;Keeper of the
Light.&quot;</p>
<p>The nearby Apostle Islands have the nation's greatest concentration of
National Park Service lighthouses, and no one is more revered than a
lighthouse keeper.</p>
<p>But the tent revue is based on keepers' journals, so the story isn't
so romantic.</p>
<p>&quot;We work all night, or the ships sail blind,&quot; sings Peter Ivory,
first assistant keeper at Outer Island in 1876. &quot;There's enough
darkness in a man, but my God, out here it stands up in your bones and
roils your soul.&quot;</p>
<p>At the foot of Chequamegon Bay, we came to
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/ashland-wisconsin/">Ashland</a>,</strong> where two local artists have spent a decade painting beautiful murals
of Ashland's citizens —  lighthouse keepers, lumberjacks, veterans.
Now, there are more than 20 on the sides of downtown buildings.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's easy to get waylaid in downtown Ashland — there's a great
bakery, chocolatier, coffeehouse and food co-op that sells craft beers
by the bottle — but we kept going.</p>
<h3>On the Gogebic Range</h3>
<p>Crossing into Michigan, we saw our first pasty shop, selling the hearty
meat-and-potato pockets favored by miners.</p>
<p>We'd been to gorgeous <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/"><strong>Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State
Park</strong></a>
and hoped to go again soon, so instead we pushed on through Ottawa
National Forest until we saw the double-decked vertical lift
bridge in <em>Houghton,</em> which makes Duluth's bridge look like a Tinker Toy.</p>
<p>The only bridge over the 22-mile shipping canal that cuts the <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/keweenaw-peninsula-michigan/">Keweenaw
Peninsula</a></strong> in two, it's the widest and
heaviest of its kind in the world.</p>
<p>Today, its lower deck is used for snowmobiles, and rainbow-colored
sailboats have mostly replaced freighters filled with copper ore.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/rossport_kayakers.jpg" alt="From Rossport, kayakers head to the lighthouse on Battle Isl" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From Rossport, kayakers weave among three tiers of islands.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Copper brought people to the Keweenaw, and when the mines closed, many
people left.</p>
<p><em>Calumet</em> was a company town — a plaque outside Washington School
reads &quot;From Minors to Miners&quot; — but its chunky red-sandstone
storefronts were built for posterity. The 1899 opera house, now the
Calumet Theatre, still is a showcase for the arts.</p>
<p>We rejoined Lake Superior at <em>Eagle River,</em>  where a sudden nor'easter
claimed state geologist Douglass Houghton not long after his surveys
jump-started the copper boom.</p>
<p>A narrow road took us past windswept beaches and through cedar forest to
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/copper-harbor-michigan/">Copper Harbor</a>. Access to
the 1866 Copper Harbor Lighthouse is blocked by a private land owner,
but you can visit if you rent a kayak.</p>
<p>Copper Harbor is at the end of U.S. 41 and the jumping-off spot for Isle
Royale National Park, and in July, tourists fill its cafes and gift
shops. But few venture to the quiet eastern side of the peninsula, where
narrow beaches line the road.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_trading_post.jpg" alt="The beach in Grand Marais." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The beach in Grand Marais, Minn., is a good place to skip stones.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We pulled over and spent several hours on <em>Oliver Bay,</em> splashing over
the shelves of smooth sandstone that lay under the water, in layers that
looked just like cinnamon-vanilla swirl cake and were nearly as crumbly
when poked with a toe.</p>
<p>Then we discovered ripe blueberries clinging to bushes covering the
roadsides — and a young bear that also had discovered the blueberries
and was too busy gobbling them to pay much attention to us.</p>
<h3>A stay in a lighthouse</h3>
<p>The Keweenaw is one of the few places in the north woods that's so
remote developers leave it alone. Reluctantly, we drove on to Marquette,
then northwest on a road that dead-ends at <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/lighthouse-stays-lake-superior/">Big Bay Point
Lighthouse</a>,
now a bed-and-breakfast.</p>
<p>There, we met lighthouse fans Steve and Judi Holland of Kalamazoo, Mich.
They'd just visited Crisp Point Light, a 1904 beacon deep in forest
west of Whitefish Point, at the end of 18 miles of bumpy road.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/g/agawa_bay_pictographs.jpg" alt="The pictographs at Agawa Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Lake Superior Provincial Park, ancient pictographs are painted on
Agawa Rock.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;The first time, I got scared away, but then I came back,&quot; Steve
Holland said. &quot;Crisp is one of my favorite places. And Au Sable, I've
gotta go back and see that.&quot;</p>
<p>They were doing the Circle Tour clockwise, heading for the lighthouses
of Wisconsin and Minnesota, and we joked that we'd wave when our paths
crossed again.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll be in the red minivan; you can't miss us,&quot; Holland said
with a smile.</p>
<p>We headed east to
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/marquette-michigan/">Marquette</a>,</strong> where we took a spin around Marquette's Presque Isle Park, possibly
the prettiest on the lake, and saw the redeveloped harbor front, where
art installations and walking paths have replaced piles of coal.</p>
<p>In <em>Munising,</em>  we took the glass-bottom boat shipwreck tour, passing
the weathered Grand Island Harbor Light on our way to peer through the
hull of the boat at splintered beams, toppled smokestacks, even a
cast-iron commode.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/e/keweenaw_bear.jpg" alt="Bear eats blueberries on Keweenaw Peninsula" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>A lucky snafu</h3>
<p>Munising is the headquarters of <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/michigan-pictured-rocks-national-lakeshore/">Pictured Rocks National
Lakeshore</a>, and we'd planned to kayak along its colorful cliffs. But the
outfitters said they had no record of my reservation and couldn't take
us, which turned out to be a lucky thing.</p>
<p>Instead, we hiked the Chapel Loop atop the cliffs, which was
spectacular, with a postcard panorama around every corner and one steep
sand slide where we ran down for a cool dip in the lake.</p>
<p>We were worn out at the end of the 10-mile hike. Still, we drove east
through miles of remote forest to the steep Log Slide of the Grand Sable
Dunes, from which we could just spot the 1874 Au Sable Point Light, then
onward to the funky little beach town of <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/grand-marais-michigan/">Grand
Marais</a>.</p>
<p>The next day we devoted to boats — big ones. At <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/whitefish-point-shipwreck-coast/"><strong>Whitefish
Point</strong></a>, shipping lanes
converge, visibility is poor and northwesters reach full fury, building
up over 200 miles of open water.</p>
<p>Hundreds of wrecks lie near the point, earning it the title &quot;Graveyard
of the Great Lakes.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pictured_rocks_swimming.jpg" alt="Swimming at Pictured Rocks." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Pictured Rocks, swimmers play at the base of cliffs near Mosquito
Falls.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The most famous wreck is the Edmund Fitzgerald, whose bell occupies an
exalted spot in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. At the museum, we
watched a short movie about shipwrecks whose opening and closing music
was — what else? — &quot;The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've only met Gordon Lightfoot once, but if I see him again, I'm
going to strangle him,&quot; the elderly clerk told us, only half-joking.</p>
<p>On our way to <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/soo-locks-shipping-sault-ste-marie/">Sault Ste. Marie</a>,</strong> the
halfway mark for people who start in Duluth, we stopped to climb the
1871 Point Iroquois Light. At the Soo Locks, we just missed the
Mandarin, a Greek ship flagged in Cyprus.</p>
<p>So we pushed into Ontario and made it to Lake Superior Provincial Park
just as the rays of the setting sun were hitting <em>Agawa Rock.</em></p>
<p>Long ago, Ojibwe lake travelers used a sheer cliff as a canvas for red
ocher pictographs. There are paintings of canoes, serpents, a horse and
a curious horned lynx with a spiked back and tail, believed to be
Misshepezhieu, the water spirit.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_overview.jpg" alt="Duluth's harbor and bayfront." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Duluth, an ore boat heads for the Aerial Lift Bridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Some think the images depict a legendary battle, but they could simply
be messages one traveler leaves to assist those who follow.</p>
<p>Climbing carefully, trying to avoid a sheer drop into the lake, we met
Ojibwe-Pottawatomi artist Ken Tabobondung of Parry Sound, Ont., who had
stopped to smoke a pipe in tribute.</p>
<p>&quot;I like to think about when the ancestors came here, when it was
natural,&quot; he said.</p>
<h3>Superior's east coast</h3>
<p>The scenery through which we traveled next — pine-studded islands,
jagged red cliffs glittering with quartz, wild inland lakes and distant
mountains — was jaw-dropping, and my husband spotted a moose along the
road.</p>
<p>&quot;This is crazy beautiful, and we're zipping right through it,&quot; he
said. &quot;This is better than the view from any lighthouse tower.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/o/copper_harbor_view.jpg" alt="The view of Copper Harbor from Brockway Mountain Drive." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At the end of the Keweenaw's Brockway Mountain Drive, there's a
panoramic view of Copper Harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But we were headed for the first really good meal of the trip, at
Kinniwabi Pines in <em>Wawa.</em>  Over plates of strawberry chicken and duck
with black-currant sauce, we met Linda and Bruce Schlueter of Ramsey,
Minn., who were doing the Circle Tour on a motorcycle and camping.</p>
<p>&quot;These provincial parks are way incredible, much nicer than Minnesota
state parks, and I love the Minnesota state parks,&quot; Linda Schlueter
said. &quot;You're going to be in heaven on Earth with what's coming
up.&quot;</p>
<p>Wawa wasn't connected to the rest of the world until 1960, when the
last section of the Trans-Canada Highway was laid there.</p>
<p>It's famous for its giant Canada goose — Wawa is Ojibwe for wild
goose — and for Young's General Store, which sells pickles from a
barrel and has a covered front porch with a stuffed moose and flush
toilets in outhouses marked &quot;Ma&quot; and &quot;Pa.&quot;</p>
<p>But Wawa also has a lovely, fiord-like lake, and we bought sandwiches
and strawberry milk and had a picnic on its beach.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>A chance meeting</h3>
<p>Fog descended as we drove into <em>Marathon,</em>  and it was drizzling when we
got to <em>Terrace Bay.</em>  Still, we made a detour to see Aguasabon Falls.</p>
<p>The four other people, in a red minivan, looked familiar. It was the
Hollands, whom we'd last seen at Big Bay Lighthouse. From lighthouses,
they said, they'd segued into waterfalls — Kakabeka near Thunder Bay,
Rainbow near Rossport, then 100-foot Aguasabon Falls.</p>
<p>They told us they'd bought baked goods from the monks at the Jampot
near Eagle River, toured Glensheen mansion in Duluth and spotted three
bears in two separate places.</p>
<p>That day, they'd seen Ouimet and Eagle canyons and had a picnic on
Nipigon Bay.</p>
<p>And they couldn't wait to see more.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a beautiful, beautiful drive,&quot; Steve Holland said
reverently.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/o/houghton_bridge.jpg" alt="boats sail under lift bridge in Houghton, Mich." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Portage Lake Lift Bridge connects Houghton and Hancock on the
Keweenaw Peninsula.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Judi Holland told us not to miss Rainbow Falls, but it was nearly 6 p.m.
when we pulled up to the park office.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you going to see any other provincial park today?&quot; the young
ranger asked us. &quot;No? Well, there's a fee, but I don't see the point,
so I'll let you in free.&quot;</p>
<p>The falls were running fast and furious, but so were the mosquitoes, so
we ran for
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/rossport-lighthouse/">Rossport</a>.</strong></p>
<p>The next day was beautiful, and we went kayaking with a guide from
Superior Outfitters. The Rossport Islands are a safer, closer-in version
of the Apostles, ideal for beginning and intermediate kayakers.</p>
<p>I'd paddled the inner islands with the outfitters on the first trip and
vowed to come back. This time, we paddled all the way to Battle Island,
where the retired lighthouse keeper spends his summers.</p>
<p>Not only did he tell us stories, but he surprised our young guide by
inviting us to climb into the 1911 red-and-white tower, from which we
had a panoramic view from the catwalk.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wawa_beach.jpg" alt="couple sit looking at beach in Wawa, ont." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Wawa, there's a beach on Wawa Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Tasty Thunder Bay</h3>
<p>We straggled into <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/thunder-bay-summer/">Thunder
Bay</a></strong> that
evening. It's a great place to eat; we stopped for gelato in the
Italian neighborhood, and had the famous Hoito pancakes in the
Finnish neighborhood.</p>
<p>And of course we visited Historic Fort William, a reconstructed North
West Co. fur post where living-history interpreters re-create 1815,
often in dramatic vignettes that involve the conflicts that often
arose.</p>
<p>In fact, we stayed until it closed, only then driving over to see famed
Kakabeka Falls.</p>
<p>Then it was back over the border and a quick stop at <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/visiting-grand-portage/"><strong>Grand Portage
National
Monument</strong></a>, a re-creation of the British-owned North West post that had to be
moved to Fort William in 1803.</p>
<p>The stretch of Minnesota 61 from the border to Duluth is a <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/11185/maps">national
scenic byway</a>, and
the scenery is spectacular and non-stop.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/point_iroquois_light.jpg" alt="Point Iroquois Light near Sault Ste. Marie." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 1871 Point Iroquois Light lies between Whitefish Point and Sault
Ste. Marie.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>You could easily spend a week or two just on this <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-minnesota/trip-planning-north-shore-minnesota/">150-mile
stretch</a>, and many do. There are agates to find, waterfalls to see, stones to
skip, sweeping views to admire and hiking in seven state parks.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/"><strong>Grand
Marais</strong></a>
is a village of only 1,350, but it has everything a tourist could want
and more, including a folk school, a craft brewery and a performing arts
center.</p>
<p>The most-photographed place on the North Shore is Split Rock Lighthouse,
and the most-visited is Gooseberry Falls State Park.</p>
<p>For the best view, drive up Palisade Head, just south of Silver Bay at
Mile Marker 56.</p>
<p>There's a flame-red lighthouse and an ore dock to see in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/visiting-two-harbors-minnesota/"><strong>Two
Harbors</strong></a>, and then you're back in busy <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/best-duluth-minnesota/"><strong>Duluth</strong></a>
— you could spend a whole week there, too.</p>
<p>It's hard to see everything on a Circle Tour; once is not enough. But
as it turns out, twice isn't enough, either.</p>
<h3>More about the Big Lake</h3>
