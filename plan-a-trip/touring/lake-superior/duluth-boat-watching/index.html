<h2>In this Lake Superior port town, tourists hang on the latest shipping news.</h2>

<p>When the ore boats start arriving in Duluth, the tourists soon follow.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, ships were part of the industrial landscape on Canal
Park, and no one thought they were all that romantic.</p>
<p>But things have changed. Today, these hulking big boats are to Duluth
what killer whales are to Sea World. Because, boy, do they make people
come running.</p>
<p>The first time I went boat-watching in Duluth, I hit the jackpot. As I
drove up to Canal Park at 4:40 p.m. one day in June, the bells began to
ring, and the Aerial Lift Bridge began to rise.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, the Adam Cornelius from Ohio pushed through the
canal, making its dark waters heave like a fat man on a waterbed.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At the dot of 5, the rust-colored hull of the Kinsman Enterprise
approached, and at 5:30, the saltie Federal Vibeke out of Oslo, Norway,
departed, followed closely by a dozen yachts and sailboats.</p>
<p>After that, I was hooked.</p>
<p>Duluth doesn't have the levels of boat traffic it once had, though
it's by far the largest port on the Great Lakes. But the boats that do
come are much bigger, and watching them is addictive.</p>
<h3>Watching giant lakers</h3>
<p>I'm standing next to the Marine Museum on a warm day in late August as
the bell on the 1930 Aerial Lift Bridge starts to clang, raising an
expectant tingle along my spine.</p>
<p>From the parking lots of Canal Park hotels, people start running toward the canal
as the bridge's steel deck rises. Cars zoom up and families jump out.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/e/mesabi_miner.jpg" alt="Waving at an ore boat in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Tourists wave at the Mesabi Miner as it passes under the Aerial Lift
Bridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The 1,000-foot Water J. McCarthy is approaching, on its way to pick up
600 rail cars of coal from Montana. Raptly, we all watch as its broad
bow eases into the narrow canal and looms above us. Scanning the decks,
I return waves from the crew, only a few yards away.</p>
<p>&quot;Geez, that baby is huge,&quot; mutters a man next to me, as it passes.</p>
<p>A cluster of German tourists are talking among themselves; listening
hard, I hear mostly numbers — siebenhundertsiebzehn, dreihundertvierzehn
— big numbers that describe the girth
of this workhorse, one of 13 thousand-footers on the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>As it slides into the harbor, the captain leans on the horn for a series
of throaty bellows that, guides explain grandly, is the traditional
salute to the bridge tender — though, when pressed, they admit it's
really for the tourists.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They are legion; the logbook in the Marine Museum is filled with names
of the regulars, people who view the boats' comings and goings with the
attentiveness usually reserved for the running of the horses, except
these are called Cornelius and Barker and Tregurtha.</p>
<p>I never tire of watching these boats arrive, whether they're the sleek
corporate lakers or scruffier salties like the Antalina and Lok Prakash,
ships from Cyprus and India that usually anchor out in the lake, saving
docking fees while they wait their turns to load up on grain.</p>
<p>For catching a whiff of far-off places, Duluth beats that hands down. It
sits at the end of the 2,342-mile passage from the Atlantic Ocean,
sailed by ships from the Netherlands and Italy and Malta on their way to fetch
the grains of the Midwest, or to bring massive turbine parts to its wind
farms.</p>
<p>The ships pass Montreal, and Niagara Falls, and the Soo Locks — and
finally they see this little city sprawling down a hillside, at the tip
of the farthest finger of Lake Superior.</p>

tanker in 1942, arrives for a load of iron ore.

<h3>Romance . . . and danger</h3>
<p>Even here, sailors were not safe from the lake with the hair-trigger
temper. One of the most famous Lake Superior wrecks was the Mataafa,
pushed against Duluth's pier by a giant wave in November 1905.</p>
<p>Life on the lake was rough. In Duluth's Maritime Visitors Center,
there's a re-created cabin from an 1870s schooner in which a
papier-mache sailor complains of  &quot;a regular dog's life.&quot;</p>
<p>It's not a cakewalk even today; also in the museum, a miniature of the
Edmund Fitzgerald lies broken in the sand on the floor of a glass case.</p>
<p>And among the models of schooners and freighters, there's one of the
1907 Chester A. Congdon, named for the Duluth millionaire whose mansion
now is a tourist attraction.</p>
<p>In 1918, the ship picked up a load of wheat in Thunder Bay, then ran
aground near Isle Royale, becoming Lake Superior's first million-dollar
shipwreck.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_canal_boat.jpg" alt="A Great Lakes freighter in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Middletown leaves Duluth. In World II, she survived a hit by a
Japanese bomber, and in 1986, a methane-gas explosion while carrying
coal. She's now called the American Victory.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Misfortune hasn't hurt Duluth one bit; to tourists, feeding the gulls
and eating ice cream on a warm summer day, it makes the city
irresistibly romantic.</p>
<p>Still, Duluth was slow to realize what a natural asset it had lying at
its feet. It wasn't until 1986 that it began to clear away the
warehouses and debris along the lakefront.</p>
<p>In 1992, the first new hotel opened, and in 1994, the first three miles
of the Lakewalk was finished.</p>
<p>Today, horse-drawn carriages and in-line skaters sail by warehouse buildings that
now contain galleries, shops, restaurants and coffeehouses.</p>
<p>As the path curves northward, it passes the renovated 1857 Fitger's
brewery, now housing an inn, shops, a nightclub and restaurants. Farther
on, there are rose gardens and parks.</p>
<p>On a summer day, Duluth is the place to be. Yet its workaday past dogs
it, and some people still ask, &quot;What's in Duluth?&quot;</p>
<p>I could say shopping or scenery, and sometimes I do. But what I mostly
say is boats, because that's what draws me — and many others — like
a magnet.</p>

<p>&quot;There's a hard core of people who are just entranced with
shipping,&quot; says long-time boat nerd Kenneth Newhams. &quot;Those boats
are immense. It's something you can't turn away from if you see
it.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Boat watching in Duluth</h3>
<p><em>Boat watching:</em>  Check for <a href="https://harborlookout.com/">arrivals and
departures</a>; times are estimates. To see where boats are on the lake, check the <a href="https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:-92.0/centery:46.9/zoom:8">MarineTraffic map</a></p>
<p>The free <a href="http://www.lsmma.com/">Lake Superior Marine Museum</a> gives
daily programs and pier history walks in summer.</p>
<p>The intra-lakes shipping season usually starts the last week of March,
with the opening of the Soo Locks in Sault Ste. Marie and the Welland
Canal, which allows ocean-going ships to bypass Niagara Falls.</p>
<p>The first saltie usually arrives the first week of April. Duluth
sponsors the annual <a href="http://www.visitduluth.com/firstship/">First Ship
Contest</a>; if you guess the
arrival time of the first saltie, you get an all-expenses-paid trip to
the city.</p>

<p>You can also watch ore boats arriving at the Superior Entry, at the tip
of Wisconsin Point. You can drive to it through Superior or walk there
from the Minnesota side on the Park Point Trail; it's four miles
round-trip.</p>

<p><em>Harbor cruises:</em>  From the Duluth dock, across the slip bridge from
Canal Park, the <a href="http://www.vistafleet.com/">Vista Fleet</a> gives 1½-hour
narrated cruises from early May through October.</p>

<p>Boat nerds may want to splurge on a corner suite at the South Pier Inn,
which have views of the harbor as well as the canal.</p>
