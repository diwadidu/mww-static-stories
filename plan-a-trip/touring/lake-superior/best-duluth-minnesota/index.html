<h2>Here's everything you need to know about visiting this lively port town on Lake Superior.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_boat_traffic.jpg" alt="Boats coming into Duluth harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
An ore boat enters Duluth's harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Thirty years ago, motorists whizzed right through Duluth on their way to
Minnesota's North Shore, putting it into their rear-view mirror as fast
as they could.</p>
<p>That changed in the early 1990s, when the rejuvenation of Duluth's
lakefront started to transform this working-class port town into the
belle of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Now, it's packed from summer through fall, and rooms at its hotels and
vacation rentals can be hard to come by. It's a Cinderella story, really.</p>
<p>But some people still wonder — what's in Duluth?</p>
<h3>What to do</h3>
<p>In summer, everyone gravitates to Canal Park for some
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/duluth-boat-watching/">boat-watching</a>.</p>
<p>It's fun just to stroll along the Lakewalk and mill around, but if you
get more ambitious, you can cross the Aerial Lift Bridge to the swimming
beaches or hike the two-mile trail on <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/minnesota-wisconsin-points/">Park
Point</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>You can also bike or skate on the Lakewalk, which follows the lake for
four miles, then parallels the excursion-train tracks for another three
miles, past the swimming holes of Lester Park to Brighton Beach on the
lake.</p>
<p>Tourist attractions include the Great Lakes Aquarium, the S.S. William
Irvin ore boat, Vista Fleet cruises and the North Shore Scenic Railroad,
whose pizza trains and annual appearance of Thomas the Tank Engine are
among the many things <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/duluth-kids/">kids love about
Duluth</a>.</p>
<p>It's free to visit the <a href="http://www.lsmma.com/">Lake Superior Maritime Visitor
Center</a> next to the Aerial Lift Bridge and the
playground at Bayfront Festival Park.</p>
<p>On the hills above town, it's fun to drive <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/duluth-skyline-drive/">Skyline
Parkway</a> for the views and to
check out the many <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/water-sports/swimming-holes-duluth-rivers/">swimming
holes</a>
(summer) and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/hawk-watching-duluth/">hawk-watching</a>
(fall). And there's great
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/superior-hiking-trail-duluth/">hiking</a>
on the Superior Hiking Trail, which roughly parallels the parkway, and
mountain biking on the <a href="https://www.coggs.com/duluth-traverse">Duluth
Traverse</a>.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>East of downtown on London Road, tour
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/glensheen-tours/">Glensheen</a>, Chester Congdon's 1908 mansion on the lake.</p>
<p>Nearby, explore the Congdon Park Trail, one of many lovely
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/duluth-walks/">walks</a> where
you'll forget you're in a city.</p>
<p>There are more attractions <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/water-sports/duluth-st-louis-river/">along the St. Louis
River</a>
in West Duluth — the
trailhead of the Willard Munger State Trail, the Lake Superior Zoo,
Spirit Mountain and the Lake Superior &amp; Mississippi excursion train.</p>
<p>There's good shopping at <a href="http://www.dewittseitz.com/">DeWitt-Seitz
Marketplace</a> on Canal Park, the <a href="http://www.fitgers.com/subpage.php?page=Retail+Shops">Fitger's
complex</a> and
downtown along Superior Street.</p>
<p>There are many free concerts and festivals as well as performances of
the theaters, symphony and opera and big-name concerts and touring
shows.</p>
<p>Downtown, the <a href="https://duluthplayhouse.org/">Duluth Playhouse</a> presents high-quality plays and musicals at the restored Art Deco <a href="http://norshortheatre.com/">NorShor
Theatre</a>. In West Duluth, the restored <a href="https://thewesttheatre.com/">West Theatre</a> presents nationally known bands and comedians and also first-run movies.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/best-winter-duluth-minnesota/">winter</a>, there's also a lot to do: alpine skiing and tubing at Spirit
Mountain, <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/skiing-in-duluth/">cross-country
skiing</a>
on 82 kilometers of groomed trails, and snowshoeing on the Superior
Hiking Trail.</p>

Duluth</a> offers tours and

<h3>What to know</h3>
<p>Duluth can be chilly even in summer, so bring a jacket and long pants no
matter how warm it is where you live. It's not uncommon for the Duluth
lakeshore to be 30 degrees cooler than the Twin Cities, only 2½ hours to
the south.</p>
<p>Don't go without a reservation on any weekend or in summer and fall.
Some events fill up the town, which is packed anyway in summer.
Conventions and high-school sports tournaments also can take up huge
blocks of rooms (and raise prices).</p>

<h3>Where to stay</h3>
<p>In summer, most people want to stay on Canal Park, where rooms cost at
least $250 and closer to $400 on festival weekends. For weekends from May through
October, they sell out far in advance.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The <a href="http://www.theinnonlakesuperior.com">Inn on Lake Superior</a>,
<a href="https://www.choicehotels.com/minnesota/duluth/ascend-hotels/mn031">Lift Bridge Lodge</a> (formerly the Comfort Suites), the
<a href="http://hamptoninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/minnesota/hampton-inn-duluth-canal-park-DULMNHX/index.html">Hampton
Inn</a>
and <a href="http://www.canalparklodge.com/">Canal Park Lodge</a> face Lake
Superior. The popular Inn on Lake Superior was first to include such
family-pleasing amenities as s'more roasts, waffle breakfasts and
loaner bikes and wagons. It's also pet-friendly and has a small outdoor
heated pool on its roof.</p>
<p>They all have indoor pools and hot tubs and offer free breakfasts.</p>
<p>Right off the Lakewalk, <a href="http://endionstation.com/">Endion Station Inn</a>
is in the 1899 railroad depot. A block away on Lake Avenue, rooms at
<a href="http://thesuitesduluth.com/">The Suites Hotel</a> (formerly Hawthorn
Suites) have full kitchens, and a hot breakfast buffet is included.
There's a pool. The least expensive rooms don't have exterior windows.</p>
<p>On the harbor, the <a href="http://www.pierbresort.com/">Pier B Resort</a> is just
across from Bayfront Festival Park (you will hear loud music on many
summer weekends) and has a rooftop patio and outdoor hot tub.</p>
<p>Across the Aerial Lift Bridge, boat-watchers love the <a href="http://www.southpierinn.com">South Pier
Inn</a>, which has two corner rooms with
balconies that have a view of the harbor as well as the canal. Other
rooms face the canal, harbor or point. It doesn't have a pool.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_saltie.jpg" alt="The Federal Oshima approaches Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A boat approaches the Lift Bridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Also on Park Point's bay side, four blocks from the lift bridge, the
<a href="http://www.parkpointmarinainn.com/">Park Point Marina Inn</a> has 68 rooms
with balconies. It includes a pool and serves a large breakfast buffet.
A block away, the <a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/dlhfw-fairfield-inn-and-suites-duluth-waterfront/">Fairfield Inn &amp; Suites by
Marriott</a>
also has a pool and includes a hot breakfast.</p>
<p>Downtown hotels are within walking distance of Canal Park. The
<a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/dlhsi-sheraton-duluth-hotel/">Sheraton</a>
on Superior Street, not far from Fitger's, is newest and poshest. The <a href="http://www.hiduluth.com/">Holiday Inn
&amp; Suites</a> is newer. West of Lake Avenue, the
<a href="http://www.radisson.com/duluth-hotel-mn-55802/duluth">Radisson</a>, known
for its round shape and rotating restaurant, is oldest. All have pools.</p>
<p>In the middle of downtown on Superior Street, the Oliver Inn occupies the former 1889 City Hall and offers 13 rooms on three floors. It rents on Airbnb and Hotels.com and has no front-desk staff.</p>
<p>Behind the Holiday Inn, the <a href="https://hosteldunord.com/">Hostel du Nord</a>
is a budget option (relatively), offering curtained sleeping compartments with
lockers and shared lounge spaces, kitchenette and dining area.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fitgers.com/">Fitger's Inn</a> is in the historic brewery
complex on the Lakewalk. It doesn't have a pool, but it's under the
same roof as restaurants, shops, a brewpub and a nightclub, so particularly suited for a <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/indulgent-retreats/duluth-girlfriend-getaway/">cold-weather visit</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/piedmont_mountain_biker.jpg" alt="Mountain biking in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A mountain biker rides past Lincoln Park on the Duluth Traverse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The town also has many vacation rentals, including beach cottages on
Park Point. Some
are in quiet neighborhoods, such as the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/6659537">Duluth Hiker
House</a>, a block from the Superior
Hiking Trail and Hartley Park.</p>
<p>In West Duluth, the <a href="http://www.mungerinn.com/">Munger Inn</a> is close to
trailheads and a perennial good value, with loaner bikes and canoes. In the Lincoln Park Craft District, the <a href="https://www.engerloftsduluth.com/hotel">Enger Lofts Hotel</a> offers studios in a renovated furniture building via Airbnb.</p>
<p>There's camping at <a href="http://www.duluthindianpointcampground.com/">Indian Point
Campground</a>, along the
river, and at <a href="https://spiritmt.com/summer/camping/">Spirit Mountain</a>.
On the <a href="http://d.umn.edu/recreational-sports-outdoor-program/programs/rental-center/bagley-nature-area-campground">UMD
campus</a>, there are six rustic walk-in sites for tents.</p>
<p>There are chain lodgings in <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/interesting-towns/superior-wisconsin/">Superior,
Wis.</a>, but they're not
that much cheaper.</p>
<h3>Where to eat</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_malt_shop2.jpg" alt="The Portland Malt Shoppe in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The PortLand Malt Shoppe is a favorite stop for ice cream.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In summer, restaurants on Canal Park are mobbed. Everyone wants to have
a burger and beer on the patio of Canal Park Brewing Company, though it
can be tough to nab a spot.</p>
<p>Across a boat slip from Bayfront Festival Park, Silos at Pier B resort
has the only waterfront dining.</p>
<p>Many of the best restaurants are downtown, including Restaurant 301 in
the Sheraton. For a cheap burger
and a huge selection of craft beer, take a seat at 7 West Taphouse.</p>
<p>Many casual but excellent restaurants are in and around the Fitger's
complex, including Fitger's Brewhouse and Va Bene Caffe.</p>
<p>For a guide to restaurants, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/best-restaurants-duluth/">Where to eat in
Duluth</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Lincoln Park Craft District</strong></h3>
<p>This newly flourishing neighborhood just west of downtown, off the 21st
Ave. W. exit of I-35, is now a magnet for anyone who likes craft beer
and cider and good restaurants. There are many shops and a hotel, too.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_folkmusic.jpg" alt="A free folk concert at Duluth Folk School." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Duluth Folk School</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Along with classes, the Duluth Folk School offers free concerts in its
cafe.

Brews</a>, <a href="http://www.lovecreamery.com/">Love

<p>There's even the <a href="https://www.engerloftsduluth.com/hotel">Enger Lofts Hotel</a>, across from the handsome <a href="https://duluthfolkschool.com">Duluth
Folk School</a>, where anyone can take a
class and learn a craft or skill. The folk school also operates the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/dovetailcafeandmarketplace/">Dovetail Cafe &amp;
Marketplace</a>,
which hosts free live music several nights a week.</p>
<p>Most of the district is on two blocks of West Superior and Michigan
streets, between 19th and 20th avenues.</p>
<p>Farther west on Superior Street, closer to the 27th Ave. W. exit off
I-35, <a href="https://www.wildstatecider.com/">Wild State Cider</a> has a taproom.
The <a href="https://duluthgrill.com/">Duluth Grill</a> also is right at the exit.</p>
