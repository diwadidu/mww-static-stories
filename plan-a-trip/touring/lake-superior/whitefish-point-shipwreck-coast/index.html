<h2>For 200 years, a bottleneck on the east end of Lake Superior has claimed ships and lives.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitefish_point_lighthouse.jpg" alt="Tourists at Whitefish Point lighthouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Whitefish Point Light is the oldest operating lighthouse on Lake
Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In 1816, the first schooner built for Lake Superior shipping also became
first to sink. It was called the Invincible, but it was no match for
winds whipping off the east end of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.</p>
<p>The Invincible wreck was the first of hundreds along what become known
as the Shipwreck Coast. The last — we hope — was the Edmund
Fitzgerald, which went down in 1975 with 29 lives lost.</p>
<p>At Whitefish Point, not far from the Soo Locks, the lake narrows into a
funnel where shipping lanes converge, visibility is poor and
northwesters reach full fury, building up over 200 miles of open water.</p>
<p>Lake Superior's first lighthouse was built here in 1848, urged on by
New York editor Horace Greeley: &quot;Every month's delay is virtual
manslaughter,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Today, the complex includes the second tower, built in 1861 with
keeper's quarters, a 1923 Coast Guard Lifeboat Station crew's quarters
and a 1936 fog-signal building.</p>
<p>In 1985, a decade after the wreck of the Fitzgerald, a museum opened.</p>
<p>Today, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum is a popular stop on the Circle
Tour of Lake Superior. The first thing tourists see when they enter is
the Fitz's bell, recovered from 535 feet of water in 1995.</p>
<p>As visitors circumnavigate the museum, they see exhibits that include
salvaged artifacts and read like tombstones: The Independence,
1844-1853, lost when its boiler exploded. The Niagara, 1872-1897,
overloaded with iron ore and sunk in a storm. The Comet, 1857-1875,
rammed by the Manitoba and sunk with 10 lives lost.</p>
<p>As dangerous as storms could be, collisions sunk more boats. The wooden
steamer Osborn, 1882-1884, was the fourth boat in a month done in by the
steel-hulled passenger liner Alberta, which liked to go faster than it
should even in thick fog.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitefish_point_taagborg.jpg" alt="The beach at Whitefish Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The sandy point also is a prime bird-watching area.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In 1909, the Isaac M. Scott struck the John B. Cowles, with 14 lives
lost and licenses of both pilots suspended. The worst loss of life by
collision came in 1920, when the Willis King and Superior City confused
passing signals and hit each other, with the loss of 29 lives.</p>
<p>Technology and better training eventually improved safety. But not much
could be done about the storms.</p>
<p>The last obituary is for the Edmund Fitzgerald, sunk in a vicious
November gale, and no one really knows what caused its demise.</p>
<p>Among the theories: The 729-foot boat hit a little-known reef while
trying to avoid the storm and damaged its hull.</p>
<p>Its steel and welds were overstressed from its years as a Great Lakes
workhorse.</p>
<p>Faulty hatch covers allowed water from 35-foot waves to enter the hold.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It was hit by the Three Sisters, a Lake Superior phenomenon in which two
rogue waves strike, followed by a third massive wave that overwhelms the
boat as it struggles to recover.</p>
<p>Many experts believe it was all of the above. After an investigation,
the Coast Guard, National Transportation Safety Board and Lake Carriers
Association came to three different conclusions.</p>
<p>The museum campus includes a theater, where visitors watch a short movie
about shipwrecks whose opening and closing music was — what else? — &quot;The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.&quot;</p>
<p>They can visit the keeper's quarters, suspended in 1929 with realistic
models of keeper Robert Carlson and his family. They can scale the
lighthouse tower for a sweeping view of passing boats and the sandy
point, covered with driftwood and detritus from storms.</p>

<p>The white-frame Coast Guard crew's quarters once was an inn, run by the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society.</p>
<p>In summer, tourists stream past its  front yard, sometimes stopping to
admire the giant rudder and tiller salvaged from the Drake, which sank
in 1901 off Whitefish Point.</p>
<p>&quot;History is not in the past here,&quot; a couple from Ontario had written
in the guest book. &quot;It is the present that is alive with the people and
stories of the past.&quot;</p>
