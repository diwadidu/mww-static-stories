<p>The Circle Tour of Lake Superior is one of the world's most scenic
drives, 1,300 miles of non-stop scenery and attractions.</p>
<p>There's a staggering number of things to do and see around Lake
Superior. But if you have only a week's vacation, you can see the
highlights on this nine-day, eight-night Circle Tour.</p>
<p>Drive clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on what festivals or
events you want to catch. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/plan-circle-tour-lake-superior/">Planning a Circle
Tour</a>.</p>
<p>For an overview of what you'll see, go to <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/circle-tour-lake-superior/">Circling Lake
Superior</a>.</p>
<h3>Duluth to Thunder Bay, 189 miles</h3>
<p>Every year, readers of Lake Superior magazine vote Minnesota's <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-minnesota/trip-planning-north-shore-minnesota/">North
Shore</a></strong>
their No. 1 favorite attraction on the big lake.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>With Lake Superior rarely out of sight, it's everyone's favorite
drive. Get an early start from Duluth's Canal Park; if you're lucky,
you can <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/duluth-boat-watching/">watch a boat</a> arriving or departing.</p>
<p>The 150 miles from Duluth to the Canadian border is a <a href="https://fhwaapps.fhwa.dot.gov/bywaysp/byway/11185/map">national scenic
byway</a>, with
non-stop scenery, including countless cobblestone
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-north-shore/">beaches</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/waterfalls-north-shore-minnesota/">waterfalls</a>.</p>
<p>Be sure to take <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/north-shore-scenic-highway/">Scenic
61</a> to <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/visiting-two-harbors-minnesota/">Two
Harbors</a>,</strong> not the Expressway, and stop in Knife River for some smoked fish or
old-fashioned candy.</p>
<p>In Two Harbors, see the lighthouse and ore docks and walk the lovely Sonju
Trail around the front of the lighthouse.</p>
<p>Between <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-minnesota/trip-planning-north-shore-minnesota/">mile markers 40 and
60</a>, you can see Gooseberry Falls, visit Split Rock Lighthouse, enjoy the
view from Palisade Head and walk the half-mile trail to Shovel Point at
Tettegouche State Park.</p>
<p>Stop for lunch in <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Grand
Marais</a>.</strong> Visit the re-created fur post at <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/visiting-grand-portage/">Grand Portage National
Monument</a>;
admission is free.</p>
<p>Just short of the Canadian border in <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/grand_portage/index.html">Grand Portage State
Park</a>,
hike half a mile to 120-foot High Falls on the Pigeon River. For closer
views, including from the top of the waterfall, hike from the Ontario
visitors center just across the border.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Ontario is on Eastern time, so you'll lose an hour. In <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/thunder-bay-summer/">Thunder
Bay</a>,</strong> the
largest town on Lake Superior, the best-located hotels are the <a href="https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/yqtde-delta-hotels-thunder-bay/">Delta
Hotel by
Marriott</a>
and the 1911 <a href="https://princearthurwaterfront.com/">Prince
Arthur</a>
near Marina Park. The nearby <a href="https://www.courthousehotel.ca/">Courthouse Hotel</a> also has lovely views.</p>
<p>Multicultural Thunder Bay is a great place to eat. And if you're there
on a Wednesday afternoon or Saturday morning, stop at the indoor
<a href="https://www.thunderbaycountrymarket.com/">Country Market</a> to stock up
on pierogies, cheese and pies.</p>
<h3>Thunder Bay to Rossport, 116 miles</h3>
<p>Spend at least several hours with the costumed living-history
interpreters at <a href="http://www.fwhp.ca">Fort William Historical Park</a>, the
world's largest re-creation of a fur post. See nearby <a href="https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/kakabekafalls">Kakabeka
Falls</a>.</p>
<p>On the way to Rossport, you'll see the turn-off to <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-sleeping-giant-park/">Sleeping Giant
Provincial
Park</a>, but that deserves more time. Instead, stop to see <a href="https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/ouimetcanyon">Ouimet
Canyon</a>, a provincial
park with sheer rock walls.</p>
<p>In Rossport, stay at the <a href="http://www.bbcanada.com/willowsinn">Willows Inn
B&amp;B</a> or <a href="http://www.serendipitygardens.ca/">Serendipity Gardens Guest

Islands</a>,
whose three tiers protect paddlers from the big lake.</p>

Park</a> and, just short of
Terrace Bay, <a href="http://www.terracebay.ca/visiting/attractions/aguasabonfalls/">Aguasabon
Falls</a>.</p>
<p>In White River, see the statue of Winnie-the-Pooh, who was inspired by a
real-life bear from the town. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/giant-statues-lake-superior/">Giants of Lake
Superior</a>.</p>

Rocks National
Lakeshore</a>.</strong></p>
<p>If possible, hike the stunning, 10-mile Chapel Loop, which includes the
