<h2>In Sault Ste. Marie, heavy traffic thrills boat watchers.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/o/soo_locks_tour_boat.jpg" alt="A tour boat goes through the Soo Locks." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A tour boat heads through the Soo Locks.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Sault Ste. Marie, tourists find out what floats their boats.</p>
<p>For most, it's watching serious machinery moving through the Soo Locks.</p>
<p>What really floats a boat, however, is 22 million gallons of water,
which is what it takes to lift a boat through the Poe Lock, a liquid
escalator between Lake Superior and Lake Huron.</p>
<p>It's a June evening at the Soo Locks, and the Earl W. Oglebay is coming
from Silver Bay with a load of taconite. A camera aimed toward Lake
Superior catches the 630-foot boat in the distance and projects it onto
a TV monitor in the Visitors Center, where boat-watchers have started to
gather.</p>
<p>As the boat approaches, we run outside, climb a viewing platform and
watch it glide into the MacArthur Lock, with only 6 feet to spare on
either side.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Its deck is nearly level with the concrete walkway, and Girl Scouts on a
field trip shout a hello at the sailors throwing off bags of bed linens.</p>
<p>The sailors wave and start to check the hatches as water drains out of
the lock and the boat sinks toward Lake Huron.</p>
<p>The Oglebay is a familiar sight at the Soo Locks, as is its beefier
brother, the 1,000-foot Oglebay Norton.</p>
<p>Boat connoisseurs, however, are happier to see the older Earl Oglebay,
whose twin maroon-and-gold smokestacks and tapered white prow give it a
style the utilitarian Norton lacks.</p>
<p>&quot;The new ones are just a barge with a pilot house on back,&quot; said
Malvina Temple, who was staffing the desk of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers Visitors Center in Soo Locks Park. &quot;The older ones are so much
classier.&quot;</p>
<p>I've found a pair of fellow boat-watchers in Temple and Doug Wolffis,
who's come up from Muskegon, Mich., for his annual week of summer
boat-watching; he also comes for a week in late September, when grain
traffic picks up.</p>
<p>&quot;My folks brought me up here when I was a kid, and I was hooked,&quot; said
Wolffis, who calls himself a &quot;boat nut.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/o/soo_locks_mesabi_miner.jpg" alt="The Mesabi Miner heads out of Lake Superior through the Soo" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
After passing through the Soo Locks, the Mesabi Miner heads for the
International Bridge and Lake Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>He keeps track of the boats by checking Internet sites, calling
lockmasters and captains and listening to a scanner tuned to the Coast
Guard frequency.</p>
<p>Once, he said, he was stopped and handcuffed by police in Muskegon when
he was watching the Kaye Barker, a handsome Edmund Fitzgerald
look-alike, while listening to his scanner.</p>
<p>So if he loves the big boats so much, why didn't he sign onto one when
he was a young man?</p>
<p>&quot;I got too comfortable,&quot; he said with a sigh. &quot;Woulda, coulda,
shoulda.&quot;</p>
<p>There are legions of boat watchers on the Great Lakes, and they're in
their element at the Soo Locks, the bottleneck through which every Lake
Superior-bound boat must pass.</p>
<p>Lake Superior, while connected to the other Great Lakes via the
63-mile-long St. Mary's River, is 21 feet higher, and most of the drop
in elevation occurs at a mile-long stretch of rocky rapids - <em>bawating</em>
in Ojibwe, <em>sault</em> in French.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The Ojibwe gathered there to fish, and a fur-trading settlement grew
around the portage. Early miners had to go through carrying their iron
and copper in wooden hogsheads. In 1845, an entrepreneur built a &quot;strap
railroad&quot; with horse-drawn carts.</p>
<p>Locks were opened on the U.S. side in 1855, allowing boats to rise and
fall within gated chambers from which valves allow water to enter and to
drain.</p>
<p>Today, there are four locks; the Poe Lock, built in 1968, is the only
one big enough to handle the 1,000-foot lakers.</p>
<p>During the shipping season, there's plenty of action. The next morning,
the 1,000-foot Walter J. Carthy came through on a coal run at 7 a.m.,
followed by the Presque Isle at 8:30.</p>
<p>At 11:10, we watched the upbound Canadian Prospector rise in the
MacArthur Lock, so big it nearly blocked the view of Canada, as the
downbound Lake Ontario sank in the Poe.</p>
<p>Doug Wolffis was there watching the Lake Ontario, which, he had heard,
had a broken bow thruster and has had to use its propeller to create a
cushion of water to help push it into position.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/a/sault_ste_marie_baraga_house.jpg" alt="Father Baraga house in Sault Ste. Marie." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Father Baraga lived in his riverfront house for 17 months after it was
built for him in 1864.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;That's what I'm always watching for,&quot; he said, &quot;how they're making the
boat do what it's doing.&quot;</p>
<p>We got another view of the locks when we were inside one. Tour boats
leave from both sides of the river, from Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., and
Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., and both &quot;lock through.&quot;</p>
<p>From a Soo Locks Boat Tours dock off Portage Avenue, along which
voyageurs ferried packs and canoes, we headed toward the locks.</p>
<p>We passed the massive Edison Sault hydroelectric plant, built in 1902,
and a Coast Guard dock crowded with tugs, including the Corps' Paul
Bunyan, a bulky gate lifter that looked like a department store with a
crane attached.</p>
<p>The Herbert Jackson was in the MacArthur Lock, so we slid into the Poe,
and soon 1Â½ million gallons a minute were hoisting us to Lake Superior
level, where the 1,004-foot Mesabi Miner was waiting to enter.</p>
<p>From the lock, we motored under the International Bridge and up to the
giant Algoma Steel plant, which has Canada's largest blast furnace, and
returned through the Canadian lock, which handles recreational traffic.</p>
<p>After the international boundary was drawn in 1783, the fur trade
settled on the Ontario side of the rapids.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/o/soo_locks_tugboat.jpg" alt="A tugboat in the Soo Locks." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Today, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., is five times bigger than its sister
across the river and the third-biggest town on Lake Superior, after
Thunder Bay and Duluth.</p>
<p>Though it has no shipping locks, it's much more of a party town than its
smaller sister, with festivities swirling around the riverfront
boardwalk, the Millennium Fountain and the white canopies of Roberta
Bondar Pavilion and Park.</p>
<p>From the deck of our tour boat, we could see the Bushplane Heritage
Centre, the Art Gallery of Algoma and the Norgoma, a retired passenger
ship that's now a floating museum.</p>
<p>Nature trails and picnic areas line the Canadian lock and canal, and
visitors can see remnants of the first lock, built in 1799 by the North
West Co. and just wide enough for a Montreal canoe.</p>
<p>Downriver, Bellevue Park has botanical gardens and is the site of the
annual Dragon Boat Festival in June.</p>
<p>Everybody who was anybody came to the Soo over the years - Father
Marquette, LaSalle, Etienne Brule. After the tour, we stopped by two
frame houses being restored on the U.S. riverfront.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>One was the home of Frederic Baraga, the Slovenian &quot;snowshoe priest&quot;
who cemented his place in history through many years of frenetic travel
between Ojibwe settlements in Sault Ste. Marie, La Pointe and Grand
Portage â€” perhaps because the diocese didn't provide him with a house
until 1864, 33 years after he arrived.</p>
<p>The other house was built in 1827 and belonged to the ubiquitous Henry
Rowe Schoolcraft, the Indian agent who also roamed Lake Superior,
exploring and collecting Ojibwe lore.</p>
<p>A sense of history pervades the Soo, carried in the wakes of the giant
boats that come and go.</p>
<p>In the Locks Park visitors center, tourists from all over the world
pepper the staff with questions about today's super freighters and the
Edmund Fitzgerald, the ore boat that nose-dived to the bottom of Lake
Superior off nearby Whitefish Point.</p>
<p>At the Valley Camp, a 1917 steam freighter that's now a museum, visitors
marvel at the boat's steel innards, a maze of boilers, engine shafts,
cylinders and generators whose joints required one sailor to do nothing
but oil them.</p>
<p>In a world run by computer chips the size of fingernails, this
industrial immensity is transfixing. And boats have only gotten bigger.
The 1,000-footers fill the Poe Lock with only 2 feet to spare on each
side, and their holds can carry freight from 600 rail cars.</p>
<p>Nose-to-nose, they're quite a sight. At the Soo Locks, big is what
brings people running.</p>
