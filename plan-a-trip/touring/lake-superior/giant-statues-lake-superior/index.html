Rocky Taconite lives in Silver Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>You can expect to see a lot of big things on the 1,300-mile drive around
Lake Superior, the world's largest lake by surface area.</p>
<p>There's a fish, a Fox, a bear, a goose and a moose — not to mention a
32-foot thermometer and a 35-foot aspiring saint.</p>
<p>These giants all have stories, part of the folklore of this colorful
lake, where life isn't for the faint of heart. On a Circle Tour, be
sure to stop and say hello.</p>
<p>Here they are, as you'd see them on a clockwise route from Duluth.</p>
<p>For more about the Circle Tour, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/circle-tour-lake-superior/">Circling
Superior</a>, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/plan-circle-tour-lake-superior/">Planning a Circle
Tour</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/lake-superior-greatest-hits/">Lake Superior's
greatest hits</a>.</p>
<h3>Rocky Taconite in Silver Bay</h3>
<p>A bulbous, cartoon-like character called Rocky Taconite celebrates the
resurrection of the iron-ore mining industry on Minnesota's Iron Range
and its shipping ports along the North Shore.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Rocky stands atop a rock slab just west of Minnesota 61 on County Road 5
in Silver Bay, which was created in 1954 around a new plant built to
process <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taconite">taconite</a>.</p>
<p>Considered a waste rock when high-grade iron ore was plentiful, taconite
became valuable when a University of Minnesota engineer figured out how
to extract the ore and roll it into pellets.</p>
<p>A plaque at Rocky's base explains that he pays tribute to the  turning
of &quot;a useless rock into a useful, valuable product and a huge new
industry for Minnesota.&quot;</p>
<h3>Walleye in Grand Marais</h3>
<p>Since 1963, the Beaver House in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Grand
Marais</a>
has been supplying bait to anglers along the North Shore. Then, in 1990,
a barroom discussion between local artist Jim Korf and Marty Cronberg,
oldest son of proprietor Bill Cronberg, resulted in the creation of a
giant scowling walleye that slices through the bait shop's roof.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/h/thunder_bay_terry_fox.jpg" alt="The monument to Terry Fox." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
All of Canada was transfixed by Terry Fox's coast-to-coast run, which
ended near Thunder Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It became a town landmark, and sometimes the owners play the radio or
tapes of fishing songs through the walleye's mouth.</p>
<h3><a href="http://visitnorthwestontario.com/attractions/terry-fox-monument/">Terry Fox in Thunder Bay</a></h3>
<p>In 1980, all of Canada was rooting for a 22-year-old British Columbia
man who was running across the nation, 26 miles a day. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Fox">Terry
Fox</a> had lost a leg to cancer
when he was 18, and on April 12, 1980, started out from Newfoundland to
raise money for cancer research.</p>
<p>At first, he attracted little notice, but along the way, crowds gathered
to watch him run. His Marathon of Hope ended in <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/thunder-bay/">Thunder
Bay</a> on Sept. 1, when he became
too ill to continue, and he died the next June.</p>
<p>Fox, who ran with a prosthesis, is commemorated at the Terry Fox Scenic
Lookout north of Thunder Bay, overlooking Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Today, Canadians speak of Fox with reverence, and those who were able to
see him along his route consider it a life's highlight. In public
polling for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's &quot;The Greatest
Canadian&quot; program, Fox finished second to Tommy Douglas, architect of
Canada's universal health-care system.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/winnie_the_pooh.jpg" alt="Winnie the Pooh in White River, Ont." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In A.A. Milne's beloved stories, the bear was named for a Canadian cub
who came to London via White River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Winnie-the-Pooh in White River</h3>
<p>One of the world's most charming children's stories had its origins in
White River, a small Ontario rail town between Marathon and Wawa.</p>
<p>In 1914, a troop train stopped in White River, and while there, Capt.
Harry Colebourn, a veterinarian, bought a black bear cub from a local
trapper. He named her Winnipeg, after his hometown, and she became the
regiment's mascot, traveling with it to England.</p>
<p>When the regiment was called to the front lines in France, Colebourn
left the cub at the London Zoo for safekeeping. After the war, Colebourn
decided to let the bear stay there.</p>
<p>The personable Winnie became the favorite of visitors, including a
little boy named Christopher Robin, son of writer A.A. Milne, and the
boy renamed his stuffed bear Edward for her. Milne's first
&quot;Winnie-the-Pooh&quot; book was published in 1926.</p>
<p>A large statue of the storybook bear stands in front of the visitors
center in White River. In August, the town celebrates <a href="http://www.whiteriver.ca/article/winnie-the-poohs-hometown-festival-in-white-river-ontario-140.asp">Winnie The Pooh
Festival</a>, with parades, a block party, fireworks and, of course, children's
games.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wawa_youngs_store.jpg" alt="Young's General Store in Wawa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Wawa, Henrietta the Moose greets visitors to Young's General Store.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Goose and moose in Wawa</h3>
<p>Wawa, which is Ojibwe for &quot;wild goose,&quot; wasn't connected to the
rest of the world until 1960, when the last section of the Trans-Canada
Highway was laid there.To the citizens' disappointment, the highway
bypassed downtown businesses.</p>
<p>So they put up a giant Canada goose to get tourists to stop and take a
gander. The goose is in front of the Tourist Information Centre.</p>
<p>The moose is at <a href="http://www.youngsgeneralstore.com/">Young's General
Store</a> in town. The stuffed
Henrietta stands on its cluttered covered porch, near flush toilets in
outhouses marked &quot;Ma&quot; and &quot;Pa.&quot;</p>
<p>Inside, the store sells pickles from a barrel, homemade fudge and all
kinds of good tourist-trap treats and souvenirs.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Gus and Ernie in Ishpeming</h3>
<p>Along U.S. 41 in Ishpeming, just west of Marquette, two staples of life
on the Upper Peninsula, giant-size, draw tourists into <a href="http://dayoopers.com/thetrap3.html">Da Yoopers
Tourist Trap</a>.</p>
<p>Gus is a 23-foot blue chainsaw that really runs, and Ernie is a 35-foot
black-powder muzzle-loader rifle that actually fires. Since Ernie weighs
4,000 pounds, it's mounted on the bed of an antique pickup truck.</p>
<p>Ishpeming also calls itself the birthplace of organized skiing, and
nearby, the <a href="http://skihall.org/">U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame and
Museum</a> includes exhibits. Admission is free.</p>
<h3>Father Baraga in L'Anse</h3>
<p>Father Frederic Baraga, a Slovenian priest, was one of the original
tough guys of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Long before John Beargrease delivered the mail along Minnesota's North
Shore, Father Baraga delivered the Word — everywhere.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanse_father_baraga.jpg" alt="Shrine of the Snowshoe Priest in L'Anse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Before he became a bishop, Father Baraga was a man on the run, often by
snowshoe.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>He arrived in 1830 at age 23 and traveled by canoe, horse, dog sled and
snowshoe between Ojibwe settlements in Sault Ste. Marie in Michigan,
Grand Portage in Minnesota and La Pointe on Wisconsin's Madeline
Island.</p>
<p>He became known as the Snowshoe Priest and, in his spare time, compiled
an Ojibwe dictionary that still is used.</p>
<p>He became the first bishop of Upper Michigan in 1853, served until his
death in 1868 and is buried in the 1890 Romanesque cathedral in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/marquette-michigan/">Marquette</a>, where efforts to canonize him began in 1952.</p>
<p>Those efforts got a big boost in March 2010, when a patient with a liver
tumor, as shown by CT scan and ultrasound, prayed to the bishop and
placed his stole over the pain. After that, exploratory surgery found no
tumor.</p>
<p>If the miracle is recognized as authentic, the diocese will need to
verify one more miracle in order for the bishop to be declared a saint.</p>
<p>High above L'Anse Bay, between the Keweenaw and Abbaye peninsulas west
of Marquette, a 35-foot bronze statue of the robed priest, holding a
cross and snowshoes, stands on a cluster of steel clouds, suspended 25
feet above the ground by beams.</p>
<p>The Shrine of the Snowshoe Priest includes a <a href="http://missionariesoftheliturgy.com/">gift and coffee
shop</a> that helps support it.</p>
<p>There's another memorial on the Cross River on Minnesota's North
Shore, where the priest blew ashore during a storm in 1846. It's known
as <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadside-attractions/father-baraga-cross/">Father Baraga's
Cross</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/e/keweenaw_thermometer.jpg" alt="A giant thermometer on the Keweenaw." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Snow Thermometer on U.S. 41 reminds summer tourists that the
Keweenaw looks a lot different in winter.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Snow gauge on the Keweenaw Peninsula</h3>
<p>So you're driving along U.S. 41 between Mohawk and Phoenix on the
beautiful <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/keweenaw/">Keweenaw Peninsula</a>, and
up comes a 32-foot thermometer along the side of the road.</p>
<p>It measures not temperature, but snow. This is Big Snow country, with an
average snowfall of 187 inches (tourism bureaus say 200). The record
high, 390.4 inches, was set in the winter of 1978-79 — that's 32 feet
of snow — and the low of 81.3 in 1930-31.</p>
<p>If you're an expert skier, you can use all that snow to schuss down the
black-diamond runs of nearby Mount Bohemia. If you're a local, you buy
a snow blower or head for Florida.</p>
<h3>Indian in Wakefield</h3>
<p>Along U.S. 2 on the shores of Sunday Lake, not far from Indianhead
Mountain ski area, stands the 20-foot bust of an Indian man carved in
1988 from the trunk of a local pine tree.</p>
<p>Hungarian-born sculptor Peter Toth called it Nee-Gaw-Nee-Gaw-Bow, or
Leading Man. Between 1972 and 1988, he created similar sculptures in
every state and several Canadian provinces.</p>
<p>There's also an unnamed statue next to the visitor-information cabin in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/visiting-two-harbors-minnesota/">Two
Harbors</a>, which Toth carved in 1977 and came to refresh in 2008.</p>
<p>His <a href="http://www.dcschumaker.com/statues.htm">Trail of the Whispering
Giants</a> series is a tribute to
indigenous cultures in North America.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/r/ironwood_hiawatha2.jpg" alt="Hiawatha in Ironwood." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 52-foot-tall Hiawatha stands in Ironwood.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Ski bum in Bessemer</h3>
<p>The cheerful red, white and blue fiberglass skier at the entrance to
<a href="http://www.bigpowderhorn.net/">Big Powderhorn Mountain</a> is a relic of
the heyday of skiing in the western corner of the Upper Peninsula.</p>
<p>That was 50 years ago, before skiers started flying to bigger hills in
Colorado. Now, this area's <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/alpine-ski-ironwood/">four alpine ski
areas</a>
struggle. The snow, however, still is the most reliably ample in the
Upper Midwest (see the snow gauge, above).</p>
<h3>Hiawatha in Ironwood</h3>
<p>This 52-foot giant isn't on U.S. 2, but it's close. Built in 1964 and
named for the noble brave of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's 1855 poem
&quot;Song of Hiawatha,&quot; this imposing fellow wears a feathered headdress
and fringed buckskin leggings and cradles a peace pipe.</p>
<p>From U.S. 2 in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/nordic-skiing-ironwood/">Ironwood</a>, turn left onto Douglas Boulevard, or Business 2. At the T, turn right
onto Frederick Street, then take an immediate left onto Suffolk Street.</p>
