<h2>At Chicago's famous Graceland Cemetery, the graves have a lot to say.</h2>

<p>It isn't true that dead men tell no tales.</p>
<p>Actually, they can be quite chatty. At Graceland Cemetery in Chicago,
their stories keep up to seven tour guides busy, especially during
Halloween season.</p>
<p>Graceland's residents are a Who's Who of Chicago society: retailer
Marshall Field, meat-packer Philip Armour, hotelier Potter Palmer, piano
maker William Kimball.</p>
<p>Often, their exits were as remarkable as their lives.</p>
<p>Strike-busting railway magnate George Pullman was so despised that his
family had to bury him in a lead-lined coffin encased in concrete and
covered with steel rail ties and more concrete.</p>
<p>Edith Rockefeller McCormick was a daughter and daughter-in-law of
tycoons, but she died penniless, and her body was put into cold storage
for two decades until her son paid for a tomb.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Allan Pinkerton is there with his detectives, one hung as a spy by
Confederates and one shot in the back while pursuing Jesse James.</p>
<p>There may or may not be ghosts at Graceland. But the dead come back to
life through stories.</p>
<p>The Chicago Architecture Foundation leads the most tours, because
Graceland is known as &quot;the cemetery of architects.&quot; Louis Sullivan
designed two tombs there, including an 1890 limestone cube in which
Henry Harrison Getty lies with his wife, Carrie Eliza.</p>
<p>&quot;Why is it so important?' asked Jeff Nichols, who was the guide for
our early-October tour. &quot;Because there was nothing Greek, Roman or
Egyptian about it. It was the birth of modern architecture in
America.&quot;</p>
<p>Louis Sullivan is in Graceland himself, under a monument paid for by
fellow architects after he died penniless, unwilling to design in the
throwback Beaux Arts style that swept the nation after the Chicago
Columbian Exposition of 1893.</p>

For the Getty Tomb, Louis Sullivan ignored traditional European styles.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, famous for saying, &quot;Less is more,&quot; lies
under elegant black granite slabs.</p>
<p>John Root chose a Celtic cross for his grave, and Daniel Burnham (&quot;Make
no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood&quot;) has the best
spot, on a wooded island reached by footbridge.</p>
<p>One of the more recent additions is Richard Nickel, an architectural
historian whose marker points, literally, to Louis Sullivan's grave.</p>
<p>In 1972, Nickel snuck into the 1894 Chicago Stock Exchange building,
designed by Sullivan and Dankmar Adler, to try to salvage decorative
elements. Two stories of the building, which was being demolished, fell
and crushed him.</p>
<p>At Graceland, your grave tells a lot about who you were.</p>
<p>In the case of Potter Palmer and his socialite wife, Bertha Honoré
Palmer, who lie under the canopy of a 16-column Greek temple, in
sarcophagi the exact size of Alexander the Great's, it says, &quot;We
didn't have much taste, but we had a lot of money.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's a carved baseball at the grave of William Hurlbert, founder of
the National League.</p>
<p>The epitaph for businessman Roderick MacArthur, who pushed his father's
foundation to award &quot;genius grants,&quot; bears the Greek letters for
&quot;one foot in fairyland.&quot;</p>
<p>The best-known grave at Graceland is that of early settler Dexter
Graves, which features a spooky hooded figure. Sculptor Lorado Taft
called it &quot;Eternal Silence,&quot; but many viewers perceive it as the
Grim Reaper.</p>
<p>It's one of the few Graceland graves that have inspired ghost stories,
along with the statue of 6-year-old Inez Clarke, who is said to have
been struck by lightning in 1880. By legend, the statue vanishes from
its protective Plexiglas box during thunderstorms.</p>

<p>Nichols says he once encountered a &quot;real&quot; ghost at the bunker-like
tomb of German immigrant Ludwig Wolff: &quot;As I was giving the tour, I
noticed people had terrified looks on their faces — because behind me,
a homeless man with a broken bottle in his hands was coming up the steps
of the tomb.&quot;</p>
<p>On our tour, Nichols finished by showing us the newest type of resting
place at Graceland: tiny, mailbox-style &quot;condos.&quot; Clearly, he did not
approve.</p>
<p>&quot;You shove the ashes into drawers, bye-bye,&quot; he said. &quot;But the
thing about cemeteries is, you learn a lot about history there.
Cemeteries are not for the dead. They're for us, the living.&quot;</p>
