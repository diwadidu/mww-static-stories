<h2>During scary season, this fun-loving city pulls out all the stops.</h2>

<p>In high-spirited Chicago, Halloween is the most spirited weekend of the
year.</p>
<p>We didn't know that before we arrived one Halloween weekend, but then a
few thousand Smurfs, zombies and cowboys bicycled past us on the monthly
Critical Mass ride through Lincoln Park.</p>
<p>A pirate skull was perched on the turnips the next morning at the
farmers market, and we saw oversized ghouls and witches waving from the
windows of mansions. Downtown, orange gushers rose from the fountain in
Daley Plaza.</p>
<p>By Saturday afternoon, nearly everyone was in costume. On Rush Street,
we chatted with Raggedy Ann and Andy, and we spent a jolly evening with
Elvis and Darth Vader in a Lincoln Park bar.</p>
<p>We came dressed as Lame Tourists, but no one seemed to mind.</p>
<p>By 4:30 p.m. on Halloween Eve, costumed trick-or-treaters were mobbing
the manors of the Gold Coast, which were passing out lavish boxes of
candy by the hundreds.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We had no idea Halloween was that big in Chicago, but we were glad we'd
stumbled into it.</p>
<p>&quot;It's therapy time,&quot; said George Garcia, owner of Fantasy Costumes in
the Portage Park neighborhood. &quot;In this crazy world, people just want to
have fun. They don't have to buy gifts for anyone, they can do it just
for themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Garcia's store, which he started out of his car more than 50 years ago,
now occupies an entire city block and is open 24 hours a day in the 10
days leading up to Halloween.</p>
<p>&quot;Halloween is big, it's huge here,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>Why Chicago? He didn't know.</p>
<p>It could have something to do with the city's history with gangsters and
one especially unsavory serial killer, made famous by the best-seller
&quot;The Devil in the White City.&quot;</p>
<p>At least four companies offer ghost tours year-round, and the Chicago
Architecture Foundation offers walking tours of three cemeteries and
&quot;Devil&quot; bus tours of the White City, the nickname of the grounds built
for the 1893 World's Fair.</p>

<p>But most of the fun is family-style. The park district opens a haunted
beach house, and museums join in, with Shedd Aquarium even offering a
Spooky Seas sleepover.</p>
<p>We did know about the big city celebration, so that was on our schedule.
First, we went on a Chicago Food Planet tour that took us into the
neighborhoods north of downtown, where we were surprised to see so many
houses sporting giant spiders, skeletons and carved pumpkins.</p>
<p>The stateliest and most historic houses had the most over-the-top
decorations. On the Gold Coast, the yard of one mansion featured a
two-story witch riding a broomstick amid hay bales.</p>
<p>In Mid-North, one of the few neighborhoods with houses that survived the
Great Chicago Fire of 1871, ghouls hung from the second-story windows of
neighboring Victorians that were wrapped with cobwebs and police tape.</p>
<p>The yellow house, said our guide, Lauren McCabe, supposedly is haunted
by people who didn't survive the fire. It's one of the many legends
that fuels Halloween in Chicago.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the biggest holiday next to Christmas,&quot; McCabe said. &quot;I
can't tell you how much candy gets sold. It's phenomenal.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>By Saturday afternoon, the bars along Rush Street were filled with
costumed revelers. We settled into Local Option, a craft-beer mecca in
Lincoln Park that endeared us with the slogan painted on its walls,
inspired by German cigarette warnings: &quot;Scheiss Bier kann tödlich
sein,&quot; or, &quot;Crappy beer can kill you.&quot;</p>
<p>The other patrons provided the entertainment. A bunch of roller-derby
girls clattered by, and Popeye and Olive Oyl did the limbo next to the
bar.</p>
<p>A man dressed as a baby came in, with sunglasses and a cigarette
duct-taped to his mouth, and the staff obligingly found him a high
chair. The Blues Brothers and Bert, Ernie, Big Bird and Oscar were
there, too.</p>
<p>The next day, we headed downtown. We'd missed the costume contest, hay
rides and trick-or-treating, but the party was going strong. Little kids
in costume scurried around, a stilt walker roamed the crowd and a
storyteller was telling Not So Scary stories.</p>
<p>The most fun was on stage. Robin and Tim Balster's Sheer Magic show was
a series of classic illusions, including the cheerfully cheesy chestnut
in which Robin was stuck in a box and sawed in half — not!</p>
<p>Then we got to watch the Midnight Circus, whose charismatic performers
presented a fast-paced collection of acrobatics, pratfalls, unicycle
tricks, juggling, jokes and exploding confetti bombs. We definitely
would have felt we got our money's worth, except it was free.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We left before the Chicago Dance Institute started teaching Michael
Jackson's &quot;Thriller&quot; dance and the Pyrotechnic fire and dance theater
started.</p>
<p>Trick or treating had started in the million-dollar rowhouses and
mansions on the Gold Coast. At one, big rubber gloves filled with candy
hung from the wrought-iron fence by colored satin ribbons.</p>
<p>Smoke bubbles wafted from the balcony, where a soft-sculpture witch
danced to music.</p>
<p>In one yard, a party of costumed adults was sitting around a table full
of bottles. Occasionally, the hostess got up for trick-or-treaters.</p>
<p>&quot;We pass the stupid candy off on them, and we drink the wine,&quot; she
said.</p>
<p>We wished we had a passel of cute kids to collect candy for us, but we
didn't feel too bad, because we'd already bagged free treats at the
high-end Hendrickx Belgian Bakery.</p>
<p>It was because we'd bought the last pistachio croissant, and it was the
end of the day. But we noticed that many Gold Coast shops hand out
treats, at least to those who ask nicely.</p>
<p>At Halloween, Chicago is a remarkably generous town. Next time, we'll
bring costumes.</p>
