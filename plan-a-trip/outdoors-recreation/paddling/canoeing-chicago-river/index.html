<p>The Chicago River never has run clear.</p>
<p>Before settlers arrived, it was a lethargic prairie river that ran
through a swamp the Potawatomi called <em>Checaugou</em> — for &quot;swamp weed,&quot; or &quot;wild onion.&quot;</p>
<p>Then factories and slaughterhouses turned it into a sewer. At the
confluence of the main branch with the north and south branches, Bubbly
Creek was named for the methane gas that rose from decomposing carcasses
on the river bottom.</p>
<p>When it fouled Lake Michigan, source of the city's drinking water, city
officials reversed the river and sent Chicago's filth to Peoria.</p>
<p>But in the 1980s, after being dredged, straightened, dumped on and dyed,
the Chicago River finally started getting some respect — and a
much-needed cleaning.</p>
<p>Now, sightseeing excursions ferry tourists past downtown landmarks, and
architecture cruises are packed with rubberneckers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Water taxis take commuters and tourists to Chinatown and the
Willis Tower. Yachts and sailboats glide out of the marinas of South
Branch condos and boat clubs, vying for space with barges and, increasingly, canoes and kayaks.</p>
<p>One year, I got in a canoe myself, joining a Friends of the Chicago River
expedition.</p>
<p>The group champions the river's 156 miles and reasons that, if people
would just get out on the river, they'll grow to love it and want to
protect it.</p>
<p>It's worked; the organization now has thousands of members and
volunteers, including former Minnesotan Mark Sorteberg.</p>
<p>&quot;Growing up near the Rum River, I never thought of canoeing; it was just
something you did with six or eight other guys and a case of beer,
zigzagging all around,&quot; said Sorteberg, a volunteer weekend guide.
&quot;Then I came on a tour just like this one, and I became a river
groupie.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, he doesn't mind paddling through a landscape filled by
skyscrapers rather than trees: &quot;You've seen one tree, you've seen 'em
all,&quot; he joked.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_river_canoeing.jpg" alt="Canoeists paddle on the Chicago River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>In a flotilla of 14 canoes, we left from the Ogden
Slip, once a loading dock in the world's fourth busiest port and now an
upscale neighborhood of townhouses and cafes.</p>
<p>We paddled past Navy Pier and the locks that limit the flow of Lake
Michigan into the river; the city had been quickening the river's flow
by adding lake water but had to stop when it was sued by surrounding
states in the 1920s.</p>
<p>Once on the main branch, we glided under the Lake Shore Drive bridge,
its deck crowded with bicyclists and walkers, and past Centennial
Fountain, whose water cannon shot off across the water just behind us.</p>
<p>People were strolling along the banks on the Riverwalk; in 1990, the
City Council began requiring new buildings to sit at least 30 feet from
the river, to allow space for a public walkway.</p>
<p>Soon one of the most famous vistas in Chicago opened up before us: the
neo-Gothic Tribune Tower, Wrigley Building and other buildings that
cluster around the Michigan Avenue bridge. At State Street, two
sailboats were waiting; as we passed, half of the bridge opened to let
them through.</p>
<p>At Wolf Point, named not for wildlife but for a tavern, we reached the
confluence of the main branch with the north and south branches and
infamous Bubbly Creek.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The Chicago River wasn't much of a river, but when a canal connected it
to the Des Plaines River in 1848, it became the critical link between
the East Coast and the Mississippi, what tour guides call &quot;the golden
funnel.&quot;</p>
<p>A great city grew, and factories and slaughterhouses found it convenient
to throw waste and carcasses into the river. In his 1906 expose &quot;The
Jungle,&quot; Upton Sinclair described spots where &quot;the grease and filth
have caked solid, and the creek looks like a bed of lava.&quot;</p>
<p>That's what flowed into Lake Michigan, from which the city drew its
drinking water. Typhoid and cholera killed thousands, and in 1885, after
heavy rains washed human sewage into the lake, more than 90,000 people
died within days.</p>
<p>Finally, city officials dealt with the problem — by reversing the
river.</p>
<p>With their effluent now flowing toward Peoria and St. Louis, Chicagoans
felt little urgency to clean up the river. It was ignored until the
early 1980s, when the city, prodded by the newly formed Friends of the
Chicago River, started to take action.</p>
<p>Chicago's official flag, ironically, pays tribute to the river: Its two
light-blue stripes represent the north and south branches of the Chicago
River. Of course, the river never has been blue.</p>
<p>Today, it's teal green, but clean enough that kingfishers and turtles
live alongside it, as well as fish that even, according to the EPA, can
be eaten once a month.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_river_kayaks2.jpg" alt="Boats on the Chicago River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Once we had paddled past the art-nouveau Civic Opera House, the
Merchandise Mart, Willis
Tower and other skyscrapers along the
South Branch, we turned our heads back for a view of the city, an island
of glass and steel now framed by green.</p>
<p>We had lunch on a grassy bank across from the Amtrak service center,
just upriver from an enormous twin trestle bridge, one of them reared
back onto a tangle of metal that was as artful as a Louise Nevelson
sculpture.</p>
<p>There's a certain beauty in industrial architecture — in the
mysterious nuts, bolts pipes and cranks of the Fisk Generating Station;
in a nifty little guardhouse suspended over the water next to an old
plastic factory; in the heavy trunnion bascule bridges.</p>
<p>The bridges rise like a seesaw — bascule is French for seesaw —
while pivoting on an axle, or trunnion; they're so finely balanced only
a small motor is needed to lift them.</p>
<p>I saw a family of geese paddling near a clump of wild yellow iris, and
mallards sitting next to a concrete retaining wall, covered by a lacy
tangle of pink crown vetch.</p>
<p>There was only one patch of litter, just down from the South Branch
Marina; wind brings much of it, especially plastic bags.</p>
<p>Then we passed Ping Tom Memorial Park, with its big red-and-yellow
pagoda, and cruised into Bridgeport, a working-class neighborhood that was home to the Daleys and three other mayors from 1933-1979 and 1989-2011.</p>
<p>The North Branch, which heads north through parks and forest preserves,
is more scenic: &quot;You have no clue you're in a metro area with a million
people within two miles,&quot; says guide Karen Harrer.</p>
<p>Sorteberg, however, prefers the industrial South Branch: &quot;I think for a
lot of guides, the South Branch is the favorite,&quot; he says. &quot;It's more
challenging; there's a lot of wave action.&quot;</p>
<p>But guide Diane Judge said she was just glad people have stopped
perceiving the Chicago River as nothing but a sewer.</p>
<p>&quot;I've lived in Chicago all my life,&quot; she says, &quot;and it's all
wonderful.&quot;</p>

On the South Branch, canoeists pass a 1914 vertical-lift railroad bridge
that can rise 10 stories in only 45 seconds, powered by a motor no
bigger than those used in compact cars.
