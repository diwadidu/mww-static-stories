<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://lwr.state.wi.us/docview.asp?docid=11222&amp;locid=50">Lower Wisconsin
River</a> in
southwest Wisconsin:</strong> From the last dam in
Prairie du Sac, the biggest river in Wisconsin flows 92 miles through
Wisconsin's Driftless Area to the Mississippi.</p>
<p>It's wide and sandy, with lots of sandbars for picnics and camping.
Lynne Diebel of Stoughton, Wis., who was written two guides about
canoeing in Minnesota, says the Wisconsin is her favorite river and
particularly likes the 21-mile stretch from Prairie du Sac to Spring
Green.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the kind of river where you're mesmerized by the beauty, and
your attention wanders,&quot; she says. &quot;But you have to pay attention to
the current, because the sandbars are constantly shifting, and you'll
run aground.&quot;</p>
<p>Also be careful of playing on the sandbars, which can collapse. Always
wear a life jacket.</p>
<p>It's 11 miles from Prairie du Sac/Sauk City to Arena, 10 miles from
Arena to Spring Green and 22 miles from Spring Green to Muscoda.</p>
<p><a href="http://blackhawkriverruns.com/">Blackhawk River Runs</a> provides rentals
and shuttle from Mazomanie and <a href="https://www.wiriverside.com/">Wisconsin Riverside
Resort</a> and the <a href="http://www.thebestcanoecompanyever.com/">Wisconsin Canoe
Company</a> from Spring Green.</p>
<p>The Friends of the Lower Wisconsin Riverway show approximate paddle
times between landings on their <a href="https://www.wisconsinriverfriends.org/paddle-planner">Paddle
Planner</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.milespaddled.com/canoe-kayak-camping-wisconsin-lower-wisconsin-river/">Miles

On the Bois Brule, a kayaker paddles past the Ordway boathouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.superiorchamber.org/bois-brule-river">Bois
Brule</a> in
northwest Wisconsin:</strong> This River of Presidents-five have fished
there-is famous for its whitewater and for beautifully preserved
cabins and boathouses built around the turn of the century.
Wildlife-watching is pretty fine, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brulerivercanoerental.com/">Brule River Canoe Rental</a> rents
boats. When water is low, rent a kayak. Make sure it's a sturdy plastic
boat, because there are lots of rocks.</p>
<p>If you're a beginner, the 12-mile section northeast of Solon Springs,
between Stones Bridge and Winneboujou Canoe Landing, is easiest and also
most historic.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/bois-brule-paddling/">Paddling the Bois
Brule</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Kickapoo River in southwest Wisconsin:</strong>
The word Kickapoo derives from an
Algonquin word that means &quot;one who moves about, now here, now there,&quot;
which may refer to the tribe that once lived in this region, but
certainly can describe the river, which flows in all four direction of
the compass on the first six river miles from Ontario.</p>
<p>It's a good place to take small children because it's not very deep, and
its inability to flow straight for more than a few yards matches a
toddler's inability to sit still for more than a few minutes. Each turn
brings a new vista, so it's nearly impossible to lose interest.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/rafting-tubing/upper-wolf-river-200179">Wolf
River</a>
in northeast Wisconsin.</strong> In northeast Wisconsin, from which the
state's biggest rivers surge, there's plenty of cold, frothy
whitewater. This river is a favorite of kayakers, and you'll need some
experience to go it alone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bearpawoutdoors.com/">Bear Paw Outdoor Adventure Resort</a>
south of Langlade rents kayaks and provides food and lodging. Local
instructors offer instruction to guests.</p>

<p><em>Namekagon River in northwest Wisconsin:</em>  This federally protected,
spring-fed river is part of the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/sacn/">St. Croix National Scenic
Riverway</a>, and paddlers are likely to spot
bald eagles, herons, otters and even porcupines.</p>
<p>Try the section from Trego, Wis., to the Riverside Landing on the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/watertrails/stcroixriver/upper.html">Upper
St. Croix
River</a>
in Minnesota. If you spend the night in one of the national-park
campsites (first-come, first-served), you can make a weekend of it.</p>
<p>And don't forget a face mask and snorkel; the river is very clear and
great for swimming and snorkeling.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_croix_kayak.jpg" alt="A kayaker on the St. Croix River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>From Danbury, Wis., <a href="http://www.pardunscanoerental.com/">Pardun's Canoe
Rental</a> provides boats and shuttle
service. The section upstream from Trego is a busy junction for
vacationers in tubes, canoes and kayaks. Rent them from
<a href="http://www.jackscanoerental.com/">Jack's</a> or <a href="http://www.logcabin-resort.com/">Log Cabin
Resort</a>.</p>
<p><em>Red Cedar River in western Wisconsin:</em>  Between Menomonie and
Dunnville, the river is crossed by 11 trestle bridges and lined by
wooded bluffs and canyon-like walls of gold sand; canoeists likely will
spot eagles, osprey and red-shouldered hawks, along with blue and green
herons.</p>
<p>Paddlers who have their own boats can take bicycles and use the shady,
14Â½-mile crushed-limestone <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/redcedar/">Red Cedar State
Trail</a>, off Wisconsin 29
in Menomonie's Riverside Park, to return to their vehicles.</p>

<p><em>Kinnickinnic from River Falls, Wis</em> . The eight-mile stretch of the
Kinni between River Falls and Kinnickinnic State Park in western
Wisconsin is lively but rarely dangerous, and because the river is
spring-fed, it's cool and refreshing all summer.</p>
<p>Kayaks are best on this river because water levels are low and there are
plenty of rocks. In River Falls, Kinni Creek Outfitters provides kayaks
and shuttles.</p>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kinnickinnic-kayaking-wisconsin/">A spin down the
Kinni</a>.</p>

<p><em>Crystal River in east-central Wisconsin:</em>  Near Waupaca and its Chain
of Lakes, the twisting Crystal River is a good place to take children or
teen-agers.</p>
<p>Tourists by the hundreds float from Long Lake into the shallow but
fast-moving Crystal River, through the village of Rural, a tucked-away
historic district of 1850s New England-style houses.</p>
<p><a href="https://dingsdockwi.com/">Ding's Dock</a> rents canoes, kayaks and
stand-up paddleboards.</p>

Lakes</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/StateForests/flambeauriver/recreation/paddle">Flambeau River</a> in northern Wisconsin:</strong>
This wilderness river cuts across the
north woods from its headwaters near the Michigan border to western
Wisconsin, where it joins the Chippewa River south of Ladysmith.</p>
<p>Outfitters in Manitowish
Waters, Phillips, Park Falls, Winter, Ladysmith and Holcombe rent boats.</p>
<h3>Iowa</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.inhf.org/upper-iowa-river-intro.cfm">Upper Iowa River</a> in
northeast Iowa</strong> : Most people don't expect
to paddle past 330-foot sheer limestone cliffs and spires in Iowa, but
they will on this stretch of river west of Decorah. The most picturesque
stretches are the 15Â½ river miles from Kendallville to Bluffton and the
16 miles between Bluffton and Decorah.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_upper_iowa_cliffs.jpg" alt="Canoeists paddle at the foot of cliffs on the Upper Iowa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Limestone palisades line the Upper Iowa River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The five looping river miles between bridges 5 and 7 would be ideal for
a mountain-bike shuttle or even walking, since the road distance is very
short.</p>
<p>Canoe liveries include
<a href="http://www.visitdecorah.com/business/hruskas-canoe-livery-and-campground">Hruska's</a>, 563-547-4566,Â and <a href="http://www.hutchff.com/">Hutchinson Family Farm
Campground</a>, 563-382-3054.</p>
<p>In Decorah, <a href="http://offthedriftless.com/tubes-canoes-kayaks/">Off the
Driftless</a> is just up
the river from Pulpit Rock Campground and rents canoes, kayaks and
tubes.</p>

Norway</a>.</p>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/watertrails/rootriver/index.html">Root
River</a> in
southeast Minnesota</strong> : The North Branch of
the Root is very picturesque and not as crowded as rivers closer to the
Twin Cities.</p>
<p>From Moen's Bridge, it's 12 miles to the spot where the North Branch
joins the South Branch and the Root River State Trail north of
Lanesboro, and another four miles to the take-out in Whalan, east of
Lanesboro.</p>
<p>Along the way, canoeists glide past solid limestone bluffs, the ruins of
an old dam and an abandoned 1915 power plant; wildlife sightings may
include eagles and herons.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Rainfall speeds up the Root considerably, and outfitters often recommend
the slower 14-mile South Branch stretch from Preston to Lanesboro if the
North Branch is too high. It's rockier, however. Check conditions in
advance.</p>
<p>If you have your own boat and want to camp, try the quieter 15 miles
from Parsley Bridge, south of Chatfield, to Moen's Bridge.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/bluff-land/lanesboro-summer-outdoors/">By river and trail in
Lanesboro</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/watertrails/zumbroriver/index.html">Zumbro
River</a>
in southeast Minnesota</strong> : In the upper
reaches of Minnesota's bluff country, this river flows past bluffs and
cliffs as it twists and turns its way to the Mississippi. The French
called it <em>la riviere des embarras</em>, or
river of obstacles, and canoeists have to watch out for snags.</p>
<p>The 12 miles from Zumbro Falls to Millville takes about half a day;
Zumbro Valley Canoe Rental in Zumbro Falls rents boats, 507-753-2568.</p>
<p>In Oronoco, <a href="http://www.boulderdamcanoe.com/">Boulder Dam Canoe &amp; Kayak</a>
rents boats and provides shuttles for trips of seven to 14 miles on
three branches of the river.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/watertrails/stcroixriver/index.html">St. Croix
River</a>
east of the Twin Cities</strong> : This is a
favorite weekend getaway destination near the Twin Cities, part of the
<a href="http://www.nps.gov/sacn">St. Croix National Scenic Riverway</a>.</p>
<p>The most popular stretch is between Minnesota Interstate Park in Taylors
Falls and the Wisconsin town of Osceola or William O'Brien State Park in
Marine on St. Croix.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/i/kickapoo_canoe2.jpg" alt="Canoeing on the Kickapoo River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/watertrails/crowwingriver/index.html">Crow Wing
River</a>
east of Park Rapids</strong> . Lynne Diebel
recommends a paddle from below Fifth Crow Wing Lake, just south of
Minnesota 34, to the Fourth Crow Wing Lake or beyond. It's 15Â½ miles to
the next dam, at the Crow Wing's confluence with the Shell River.</p>
<p>&quot;It's got incredibly clear water and a sandy bottom,&quot; she says.
&quot;It's a nice place to get away from it all.&quot;</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/watertrails/cannonriver/index.html">Cannon
River</a>
south of the Twin Cities</strong> : Less than an
hour away, the Cannon River is one of the Twin Cities' favorite canoeing
and tubing destinations, and on weekends the stretch from Cannon Falls
to Welch is full of church and school groups. French fur traders named
the river not for artillery but for canoes, <em>la riviere aux canots</em>.</p>
<p>There are a few riffles near the put-in at Cannon Falls' Riverside Park,
but from there, it's an easy 12 miles through the scenic river gorge to
Welch.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.welchmillcanoeandtube.com/">Welch Mill Outfitters</a> in Welch
does a good job of handling the hordes. Canoeists who want a quieter
experience should arrive by 8 a.m. People who have their own canoes can
bring bikes and return to their vehicle on the Cannon Valley Trail.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/cannon_canoe_lunch_spot.jpg" alt="Paddlers on the Cannon River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Ron Heck</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Cannon River between Faribault and Dundas, paddlers pull up to a
lunch spot.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you have your own boats, you'll get a quieter ride by putting in at
Two Rivers Park in Faribault, just off I-35, and paddling 14 miles to
the Dundas city park or 17Â½ miles to Northfield.</p>
<p>Bring a picnic to eat and watch for a tall bluff on the right, with sand
at its foot, about an hour from Faribault. There's a trail to the top,
and the views are superb.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Great paddling rivers</h3>
<p><em>When to go</em> : For the quietest paddling, with the best chance of
wildlife spotting, go on a weekday. If you go on a weekend or holiday,
reserve rental and shuttle and try to arrive early in the day.</p>
<p><em>Cost</em> : Typically, a half day of canoe rental with shuttle service
costs $30-$40, less for groups. Two parties who own two canoes and two
cars can arrange their own shuttles; another option is to take bicycles
in the canoe or leave them at the take-out point.</p>
<p>Outfitters are conservative about estimating paddling time, so a
four-hour trip usually takes closer to three hours if canoeists don't
loaf too much.</p>
<p><em>Safety</em> : Before you go, ask outfitters or park employees about water
levels; heavy rains can make a river unsafe. Watch out for overhanging
tree branches, which tip canoes more frequently than rapids.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin paddling</h3>
<p>Wisconsin's Activity Guide lists 76 places to rent boats in 57 towns;
