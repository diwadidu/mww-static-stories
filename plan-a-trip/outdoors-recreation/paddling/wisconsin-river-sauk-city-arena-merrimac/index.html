<h2>The valleys and bluffs around Prairie du Sac draw paddlers, hikers and Sunday drivers.</h2>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At Prairie du Sac, the Wisconsin River finally breaks free.</p>
<p>Lined with so many dams and reservoirs it's often called the nation's
hardest-working river, the Wisconsin devotes itself to play after it
passes the town.</p>
<p>Then it becomes the Lower Wisconsin State Riverway, beloved by
canoeists, who like to play on its many sandbars.</p>
<p>The busiest stretch is west of Sauk City, which is halfway between
Wisconsin Dells and Madison but has its own A-list attractions:
bluff-top panoramas, a historic vineyard, a paved bike trail, a free car
ferry, a picture-postcard mill and, of course, the river.</p>
<p>In one jam-packed weekend, we sampled all of it and more.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.saukprairie.com/">Prairie du Sac and Sauk City</a></h3>
<p>These adjoining towns on the Wisconsin River, together known as Sauk
Prairie, are best known for the bald eagles that hang around in winter,
picking off fish stunned by the turbines in Prairie du Sac's
hydroelectric plant.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The two main streets follow the river between the Wisconsin 60 bridge in
Prairie du Sac to the U.S. 12 bridge in Sauk Prairie and are linked by
the paved, 10½-mile <a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/greatsauk">Great Sauk State
Trail</a>.</p>
<p>Sauk City is the home of my friend Debra's sister Sue Ann, an
enthusiastic paddler and bicyclist who wanted to show us her favorite
places.</p>
<p>First, we stopped at the Saturday-morning farmers market and River Arts on
Water Gallery, near the riverfront.</p>
<p>Then, we headed <strong>west.</strong></p>
<h3><a href="https://dnr.wi.gov/topic/lands/lowerwisconsin/">Lower Wisconsin State Riverway</a></h3>
<p>There are
outfitters who
supply canoes and kayaks for the 11-mile trip to Arena from Sauk City,
but we have our own boats, so we put in at the canoe landing south of
town, off Lueders Road.</p>
<p>It was a gorgeous evening on the wide, slow river. We passed a few houses,
then nothing but wooded banks; the state owns most of the land along the
last 92 miles of river.</p>
<p>As we paddled along, a biplane swooped over our heads, and the pilot
waved. A big family was hanging out on the opposite bank, with a gazebo
tent, chairs, coolers and toys.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Bald eagles sit in trees on both sides of the channel to the mouth of
Honey Creek, just four miles from Sauk City. We got out, loaded our boats
and climbed a mile to a gorgeous overlook.</p>
<h3><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=217">Ferry Bluff</a></h3>
<p>Named for a Civil War-era ferry landing, this sandstone bluff rises more
than 300 feet above the river. The views from its ledges are
magnificent, especially at dusk, when the river reflects the moon and
clouds tinted pink by the setting sun.</p>
<p>As we headed back to the landing, the woods twinkled with hundreds of
fireflies, like a fairy version of fireworks.</p>
<p>Ferry Bluff also is a popular day hike and picnic spot, reached by Ferry
Bluff Road off Wisconsin 60 west of Sauk City.</p>
<p>Outfitters out of Mazomanie (pronounced MAY-zo-MAY-nie) and Spring Green
supply canoes for the 10-mile trip from Arena to Spring Green.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/y/hyde_mill.jpg" alt="Hyde Mill south of Arena, Wis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The dam at Hyde Mill was built in 1850.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Hyde's Mill</h3>
<p>In the bucolic coulees south of Arena, you'll find this old wooden mill
on Mill Road, between County Road T and H.</p>
<p>With its big wooden water wheel, on a mill pond next to a lively
waterfall over an 1850 stone dam, it's a favorite of photographers.</p>
<p>Theodore Sawle, who lived in the miller's house and had operated it
since 1931, died in 2009 at age 103.</p>
<p>There was a history fair going on around the corner, to celebrate the
sesquicentennial of the 1862 <a href="http://www.hydechapel.com/">Hyde Chapel</a>.
But we didn't see any food there, so we headed into Spring Green for
lunch.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/spring-green/">Spring Green</a></h3>
<p>As a tourist attraction, this town is more than a little bipolar, with
the high-brow Taliesin built by Frank Lloyd Wright and the low-brow
House on the Rock.</p>
<p>Many people forget it's also a river town. We ate at the <a href="http://www.wiriverside.com/">Wisconsin
Riverside Resort,</a> watching passing canoes
and flotillas of tubers lolling offshore.</p>
<p>On Wisconsin 14, we stopped at <a href="https://hodancs.org/bargain-nook-stores/">Bargain Nook
III</a> for a few Land's End
deals. In town, we peeked in the windows of the <a href="http://www.shittybarnsessions.com/">Shitty
Barn</a>, a funky folk venue. It was
empty, but we could see it'd be a fun place to hear music.</p>
<p>You could easily spend a whole weekend here. But we head for our next
stop, <em>east</em> of Sauk City.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/o/wollersheim_cave.jpg" alt="The wine cave at Wollersheim." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/wollersheim-winery-wisconsin-river/">Wollersheim Winery</a></h3>
<p>On the hillside just across the river
from Prairie du Sac, this stone winery, surrounded by old oaks, is
Wisconsin's first and most picturesque. It also has the most
interesting backstory.</p>
<p>In 1840, the first vines were planted by a Hungarian count, who left to
follow the Gold Rush in 1849 and became the father of the California
wine industry. They were taken up by a German immigrant, but in 1899 his
son died and the vines froze.</p>
<p>In 1972, Bob Wollersheim rejuvenated the vineyard, becoming Wisconsin's
first modern winemaker. Today, its Prairie Fumé is one of the state's
most popular wines, and its annual Grape Stomp became so popular it had
to be discontinued.</p>
<p>The property is on the National Register of Historic Places, and Bob and
JoAnn Wollersheim's daughter Julie and her winemaker husband, Philippe
Coquard, make the wines.</p>
<p>When we stopped by, the place was buzzing. Patrons were taking tours,
sampling wines and drinking in the wine garden. It's not Falcon Crest,
but it's close.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/e/merrimac_gibraltar_rock_me.jpg" alt="Hiking up Gibraltar Rock." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Sue Ann Schwanke</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="http://www.devilslakewisconsin.com/information-center/other-natural-areas/gibraltar-rock/">Gibraltar Rock</a></h3>
<p>Just south of Lake Wisconsin, on County Road VA west of Wisconsin 113,
we parked and climbed up an overgrown road.</p>
<p>The view from the gnarled cedars atop this 200-foot cliff makes it one
of the most popular spots on the Ice Age National Scenic Trail.</p>
<p>It's a Sconnie version of Grant Wood country, with rolling farmsteads
in the forefront, the Baraboo Hills in the distance and the giant lake
of the Wisconsin River around the corner.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like being on the Devils Lake bluffs, except there's more below
you than just the lake,&quot; Sue Ann said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/e/merrimac_ferry.jpg" alt="The Merrimac ferry docks on the north side of the river." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicyclists are first to roll off the Merrimac car ferry.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/water/merrimac/default.aspx">Merrimac car ferry</a></h3>
<p>Every day, all day, the free Colsac III ferry serves as the bridge on
the highway between Baraboo and Lodi. It's also the bridge for the Ice
Age Trail.</p>
<p>We waited for it to chug across Lake Wisconsin, then boarded and enjoyed the
view. It's part of the highway system, but it seemed to us like a poor
man's cruise.</p>
<p>When they were little, Sue Ann and Debra used to go for Sunday drives
with their family, crossing on the ferry and stopping for ice cream at
one of the stands on each side of the river.</p>
<p>We wondered if the captain would kick us off if we rode all day.</p>
<p>&quot;We could bring a grill, some brewskis and lawn chairs and make a day
of it,&quot; Debra joked.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.durwardsglen.org">Durward's Glen</a></h3>
<p>North of Merrimac, off Wisconsin 78, we drove into a peaceful retreat
built by the Durwards, a family of priests, painters and writers who
arrived in the valley in 1862.</p>
<p>There's a chapel, a lodge, a guesthouse, a shrine and, most interesting
to us, the Cornerstone Hermitage. This narrow, two-story building was
built in 1926 by Father John Durward for his own use while visiting his
family.</p>
<p>Later, it was filled with mounted birds by Wilfrid Durward and used as
an art gallery by Mary Durward. Now, it's available to the public for
their own retreats. The public also is welcome to walk along the
babbling brook and picnic in the glen.</p>
<h3>Nearby attractions</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=1">Parfrey's
Glen</a>,</strong>
Wisconsin's first state natural area and one of the most magical spots
on the Ice Age Trail, is two miles southwest of Durward's Glen.</p>
<p>It's connected by the trail to <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake/">Devils Lake State
Park</a>,</strong>
Wisconsin's magnificent and most-visited state park.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/circus-world-baraboo/">Baraboo</a></strong>
is just north of the Devils Lake. The late Tom Every's
<a href="http://worldofdrevermor.com/"><strong>Forevertron</strong></a> and other scrap
sculptures are just north of Prairie du Sac along U.S. 12.</p>
