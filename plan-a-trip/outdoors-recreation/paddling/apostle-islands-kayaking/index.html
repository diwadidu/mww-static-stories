<h2>The wild 21-island archipelago around Wisconsin's Bayfield Peninsula is the preserve of paddlers.</h2>

<p>The sky was clear, the wind was still and Lake Superior was as placid as
a lily pond.</p>
<p>It was a miracle that wouldn't last.</p>
<p>That's why it was torture for the dozen of us to sit through a long
kayak safety course on the sandy beach of Bayfield, Wis., forming a
&quot;human knot&quot; to foster cooperation in case of disaster and
listening to trip leader Hovas Schall's horror stories about the big,
mercurial lake.</p>
<p>&quot;Kayakers play a game with the weather, and the weather always
wins,&quot; she said darkly. &quot;Sea kayaking is a dangerous sport.&quot;</p>
<p>Kayaking, however, was the only way the dozen of us were going to get to
see any of the 21 islands of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.</p>
<p>Geologists say the Apostles, which rise in picturesque irregularity off
Wisconsin's Bayfield Peninsula, were created by scraping glaciers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But the Ojibwe have another explanation: The great Naniboujou, angry at
a beaver, threw rocks into Lake Superior, forming the islands.</p>
<p>Four or five centuries ago, the Ojibwe arrived from the east, driven out
by the Iroquois. French explorers arrived in the 1600s, followed by fur
traders, whose business revolved around Madeline Island, the largest of
the Apostles.</p>
<p>On the other Apostles, the Ojibwe set up summer camps for fishing,
hunting and berry-gathering — until the white influx pushed them onto
reservations in 1854 and used the islands to supply timber and brown
sandstone to build Milwaukee, Chicago and other cities.</p>
<p>But the quarries and logging camps eventually were abandoned, and
wilderness returned.</p>
<p>In 1970, one step ahead of developers, Wisconsin Sen. Gaylord Nelson
pushed a bill through Congress that made the islands and a 12-mile strip
of the mainland into national lakeshore, managed by the National Park
Service. Only Madeline remains private.</p>
<p>Today, the lighthouses built to protect Great Lakes shipping are the
main reminder of modern commerce.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/p/apostles_sand_island_lighthouse.jpg" alt="The lighthouse on Sand Island." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There are automated light stations on six of the islands. Park-service
rangers give tours of the Raspberry Island lighthouse, and volunteers
staff the lights at Sand, Devils and Michigan islands. On Manitou
Island, a 1930s fish camp has been restored and is staffed by
volunteers.</p>
<p>Bits of colorful history swirl around the islands: shipwrecks, hermits,
war parties, even pirates and stolen gold.</p>
<p>But it is for the natural history that most come. Visitors hope to catch
a glimpse of black bears on Stockton, which has the nation's densest
concentration.</p>
<p>They want to see the sea caves, watch rookeries of herons and herring
gulls, and hike the miles and miles of trails.</p>
<p>Our little kayaking group was headed for Sand Island, three miles off
Little Sand Bay, at the top of the Bayfield Peninsula.</p>
<p>As it turns out, my premonition about the weather was on the money; by
the time we set out, gusts had blown in from the northeast and the water
was gray and choppy.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Soon, we were sinking into the troughs of waves that neared 4 feet, and
our paddle strokes seemed to make puny progress. But finally we were
pulling our kayaks onto the narrow beach of Sand Island.</p>
<p>We shared a dinner of grilled whitefish with Gene Wilkens, a
park-service volunteer from Texas who was keeping tabs on things: &quot;I saw a
black bear last night,&quot; he said. &quot;We just looked at each other,
said, 'Woo-eee!' and turned around.&quot;</p>
<p>Mostly, Wilkens loved to tell stories — about the 1914 fire on the tug
Herring King, and the Norwegian fishermen who lived in Shaw, the only
village to take root in the Apostles beside La Pointe on Madeline.</p>
<p>And he relished telling the story about the three hot-shot kayakers who,
in Wilkens' version of a campfire ghost story, nearly found a watery
grave a few yards off Sand one treacherous Memorial Day.</p>
<p>The late-August morning dawned clear and calm, and we took a dip before
putting on wetsuits and heading for the sea caves at Swallow Point.</p>
<p>The sun illuminated the dusky reds of the sandstone, and we glided
inside, under arches and among rocky pillars that resembled dinosaur
shins.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/p/apostles_sand_island_caves.jpg" alt="Kayakers at the Sand Island sea caves." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The sea caves on Sand Island are a popular destination for kayakers.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The lapping of the water in the rounded rooms created a hollow gurgling;
it was easy to see why the Ojibwe thought the caves had a malevolent
character.</p>
<p>After lunch, we hiked along the two-mile trail to the lighthouse, where
volunteer keeper Nancy Peterson of Minneapolis gave us a tour of the
stone Gothic Revival building she thinks &quot;is absolutely the most
beautiful in the Apostles.&quot;</p>
<p>From the tower, she pointed out the red buoy that marked the shoals on
which the ore freighter Sevona foundered in 1905.</p>
<p>&quot;There were 25-foot waves, and the boat was broken in half,&quot; she
said. &quot;The crew jury-rigged a life raft and got within 100 yards of
Justice Bay, but the raft broke and they all drowned. The keeper's
journal shows they looked for seven bodies and finally found them on
Oct. 2, a month later.&quot;</p>
<p>On the way back to camp, Schall showed us the difference between a
thimbleberry and a raspberry, hugged a tree and talked about her
favorite islands — Devils for its huge blueberries, Bear for
underwater sea caves, Raspberry for its lighthouse tour.</p>
<p>But Sand, she said, has a little of everything.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an interesting island, it really is,&quot; Schall said. &quot;If
it weren't for the National Park Service, it might be condominiums.&quot;</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Kayaking the Apostle Islands of Wisconsin</h3>
<p><em>What to know:</em>  If you paddle without a professional guide, wear (not
just bring) a wetsuit and life jacket.</p>
<p>The park service recommends other <a href="http://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/kayaking.htm">items to
bring</a>, including a
marine radio, and what you need to know.</p>
<p>It's very important to check the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/weather.htm">weather
forecasts</a> before
setting out. Conditions can change quickly.</p>
<p><em>Sea caves:</em>  There are caves on the rocky shores of Devils Island, Sand
Island and on the mainland near Meyers Beach.</p>
<p>Kayakers heading for the mainland sea caves should check
<a href="http://seacaveswatch.org/">SeaCavesWatch.org</a> for the real-time wave
height at the caves, where cliffs reflect and amplify waves. Large waves
can be very dangerous for paddlers, and conditions cannot be seen from
the Meyers Beach put-in.</p>
<p>In winter, they are famous for ice formations. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/ice-caves-apostles/">Ice caves
of the Apostles</a>.</p>

Little Sand Bay. There's a $5 parking fee at Meyers Beach.</p>
<p><em>Lighthouses:</em>  There are eight light stations on six islands; two are
retired.</p>
