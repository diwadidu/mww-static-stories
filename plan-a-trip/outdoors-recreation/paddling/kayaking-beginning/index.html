<p>For a lot of people, canoeing is last year's sport. Kayaking is a step
up, like trading in the mini-van for a Miata.</p>
<p>Who wouldn't want a zippy little kayak to pilot all by yourself,
without that other person yelling at you from the stern (or bow)?</p>
<p>But a kayak with all the accessories is expensive. And it's hard to
decide what kind of boat to buy, because you need a different kind for
different bodies of water-whitewater, lakes, rivers and inland seas,
such as the Great Lakes.</p>
<p>First, try the sport with an outfitter, nature center or state-park
program.</p>
<p>Then, rent a boat from an outdoors store and spend a few weekends
paddling on your own. If you decide you want your own boat, try out
several kinds during free demo days on lakes.</p>
<p>After you buy your own boat, hone techniques by joining a paddle club,
where more experienced paddlers will help you. Get even better by going
to a paddling festival.</p>
<p>Here's how to get started.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Trying the sport</h3>
<p>Many outdoors stores hold free demos on lakes throughout the summer,
starting in late April. Just show up and take some boats out for a spin.
The more you try, the better sense you'll get of what you want.</p>
<p>Then, take a low-key class from a parks district or environmental
center. Many outfitters and outdoors stores also offer inexpensive day
paddles.</p>
<p>Next, rent a boat for a weekend. The cost is generally starts at $20 a
day for the smaller plastic boats and goes to $40 for high-end
fiberglass sea kayaks.</p>
<p>It's always cheaper to rent for a weekend or week. Rates include life
vests, paddles, spray skirts and vehicle pads and straps.</p>
<p>Universities and colleges that have outdoors programs often rent boats
inexpensively, to the public as well as students.</p>
<p>In the Twin Cities, <a href="http://www.midwestmtn.com">Midwest Mountaineering</a>
holds <a href="http://www.midwestmtn.com/departments/paddling">kayak demos</a> all
summer, many on Lake Nokomis. It sells and rents a wide variety of
kayaks. It often offers a Kayaking 101 class at the Minneapolis store.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_kayak_class.jpg" alt="A kayak class at Lutsen Resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

sea-kayak tour of Lake Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Madison, <a href="http://www.rutabaga.com/">Rutabaga Paddlesport Shop</a> rents
kayaks and offers classes, youth and family programs, group paddles and
day trips.</p>
<p>In the northern Chicago suburb of Lake Bluff, on Lake Michigan, <a href="http://www.greatlakeskayak.com/">Great
Lakes Kayak</a> offers classes and demos
by appointment.</p>
<p>In the Rockford, Ill., suburb of Loves Park, <a href="http://www.paddleandtrail.com/">Paddle and
Trail</a> offers classes, day trips and
tours. Both stores are on lakes, so customers can try kayaks any time.</p>
<p>In Marquette and Houghton on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, <a href="http://downwindsports.com/mainSite/">Downwind
Sports</a> holds many kayak demos.</p>
<p>In the Driftless Area of northeast Iowa, <a href="http://www.crawdaddyoutdoors.com/">Crawdaddy
Outdoors</a> in Waverly holds <a href="http://crawdaddyoutdoors.com/crawdaddy-events/">Demo
Days</a>. It rents boats
for use on many good kayaking rivers-the Upper Iowa, Cedar, Shell
Rock, Turkey, Volga, Wapsipinicon and Macquoketa.</p>
<p>In summer, it offers guided river floats, $20 with boat and $30
without.</p>
<p>REI stores require reservations and a fee to attend its demos; the fee
is waived for people who buy a boat. The policy does allow potential
buyers to request specific boats to try, and REI staff are able to work
more closely with customers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Shopping for a kayak</h3>
<p>First, go to your local outdoors stores and talk to the sales folks. Be
sure to take notes, because after a while, your head will be swimming.</p>
<p>Looking for the right boat is a lot like dating-you'll see a whole
array of fine qualities, but never all in the same candidate.</p>
<p>Some kayaks are super-stable, with a sit-on-top seat or extra-big
cockpits for fishing equipment, bird-watching gear or even a dog.
They're also super-slow.</p>
<p>Some kayaks are very fast, but slim and tippy. Most people think they
want a sea kayak, the long, sleek boats that slice through the water.
The longer the boat, the better it will track in the water, and the less
energy you'll expend to propel it.</p>
<p>However, the longer the boat is, the more it weighs-unless you can
afford $2,000-$3,000 for a fiberglass-Kevlar composite-and that
means you'll expend more energy hoisting it onto and off a vehicle and
into the water.</p>
<p>&quot;For people paddling in the cities, (a sea kayak) is more boat than you
really need or usually want,&quot; says kayaker Peter Orton, who sells sea
kayaks for Valley. &quot;The buying public really likes stability; they
don't really have aspirations for high performance. You can have an
awesome time in a little rec boat that costs $300.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/a/namekagon_kayaker.jpg" alt="Kayaking on the Namekagon River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>You wouldn't want to take a 17-foot sea kayak onto a small, winding
river, because they're too long to turn easily, and you may crack it on
a boulder. But they're fine on lakes.</p>
<p>A 10-foot boat will turn easily, but it also will zig and zag on a lake
no matter how well you paddle.</p>
<p>A 13-foot hybrid can handle both Class II rapids on a river and a calm
day along the Lake Superior shore. But it won't handle waves nearly as
well as a sea kayak. And if all your friends are in fast 17-foot boats,
you're going to feel slow and frustrated.</p>
<p>Then you have to think about material. Do you want to paddle mainly on
rocky rivers with rapids? Get a plastic boat, which are cheapest but
also heaviest. Then, you'll have to figure out some kind of system to
wrestle it onto your car.</p>
<p>Composite boats are much lighter, but up to $1,000 more expensive.
They're easier to damage, but also easier to repair. If you put a hole
in a plastic boat, it's ruined.</p>
<p>You can solve both transportation and repair problems by buying an
inflatable or foldable kayak, which you can take it to use in fabulous
tropical destinations.</p>
<p>Inflatable kayaks are slow, harder to maneuver and a little dorky
looking. But the foldable <a href="http://www.orukayak.com/">Oru kayak</a> may be a
good option.</p>
<p>It's enough to make your head spin.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>More research</h3>
<p>When you get home from the store, start looking at web sites and compare
specifications and prices. <a href="http://www.rutabaga.com">Rutabaga</a>, for
example, categorizes its kayaks by length, weight and material, so it's
easy to see what's available.</p>
<p>Check paddling magazines and the buyer's guide and user reviews at
<a href="http://www.paddling.net">Paddling</a> and other sites. In early March, go
to Rutabaga's
<a href="http://www.rutabaga.com/canoecopia/page.asp?pgid=1001">Canoecopia</a>
paddling expo in Madison, the largest in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be in a rush to buy your first kayak,&quot; says Peter Orton.</p>
<p>&quot;Start the process and develop an understanding of what you're going
to enjoy about it. People think they're going to go on a long sea
kayak, then mostly they paddle for an hour after work.&quot;</p>
<h3>Buying a kayak (and accessories)</h3>
<p>Most shops also offer discounts on new boats during April and May
sales.Â  In Minneapolis, Midwest Mountaineering holds a large auction of
used canoes and kayaks during its <a href="http://www.outdooradventureexpo.com">Outdoor Adventure
Expo</a> in late April.</p>
<p>At the end of the season, many outfitters and stores sell their used
kayaks at deep discounts. And be sure to budget for a paddle, life
preserver, spray skirt, dry bags and rooftop carrier, at a minimum.</p>
<p>Eventually, you also may want a paddle float, cockpit cover, wetsuit,
neoprene socks and other gear.</p>

River near Decorah.

<h3>Paddling with a club</h3>
<p>Paddle clubs are filled with experienced people who are happy to help
new kayakers. In winter, many sponsor pool training, so paddlers can
practice techniques and rescue recovery.</p>
<p>Membership fees are nominal, usually $15-$20.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, the <a href="http://www.canoe-kayak.org/">Minnesota Canoe
Association</a> promotes kayaking as well as
canoeing, flat and whitewater.</p>
<p>From the Twin Cities, the <a href="http://www.river-ramblers.org/">River
Ramblers</a> offer leisurely paced day and
weekend trips in Minnesota and Wisconsin from April through September,
$2 per trip or $5 per year.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis-based <a href="http://www.inlandseakayakers.org/">Inland Sea
Kayakers</a> offer day and overnight
trips for paddlers of all skill levels on Lake Superior and Voyageurs
National Park as well as the Mississippi and St. Croix rivers.</p>
<p>The Twin Cities-based <a href="http://www.rapidsriders.org/">Rapids Riders</a> is a
whitewater paddling group and sponsors Canoe U whitewater classes on the
St. Croix River in spring.</p>
<p>The Twin Cities-based <a href="http://www.skoac.org/">Superior Kayak and Outdoor Adventure
Club</a> offers kayaking trips to Lake Superior as
well as hiking on the North Shore and winter camping in the Boundary
Waters.</p>
<p>In Madison, the <a href="http://www.madcitypaddlers.org/">MadCity Paddlers</a> hold
day and weekend trips around Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.caska.org/">Chicago Area Sea Kayakers Association</a> holds
day and weekend trips on Lake Michigan and on waterways in Illinois,
Wisconsin and Michigan.</p>
<p>Also in the Chicago area, <a href="http://www.prairiestatecanoeists.org/">Prairie State
Canoeists</a> offers dozens of day
and weekend trips on rivers in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin,
plus northern Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa and Indiana.</p>
<p>In northwest Michigan, the <a href="http://www.traverseareapaddleclub.org/">Traverse Area Paddle
Club</a> plans many trips.</p>
<p>More paddling clubs are listed at
<a href="http://www.paddling.net/associations.html">Paddling.net</a>.</p>
<h3>Going to a kayak festival</h3>
<p>At weekend kayak festivals and symposiums, kayakers of all levels can
attend clinics and workshops and join day tours.</p>
<p>For a list of festivals in the Upper Midwest, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/kayak-festivals/">Kayak
klatch</a>.</p>
