<h2>Off Ontario's Superior coast, a lighthouse is an irresistible destination.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/rossport_kayakers.jpg" alt="From Rossport, kayakers head to the lighthouse on Battle Isl" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From Rossport, kayakers weave among three tiers of islands.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At the top of Lake Superior, there's a dramatic coast lined with rugged
cliffs, cobblestone beaches and islands.</p>
<p>It's the home of Parks Canada's Lake Superior National Marine
Conservation Area, created to protect the waters between the Sibley
Peninsula, east of Thunder Bay, and the Slate Islands, off Terrace Bay.</p>
<p>These waters are thick with islands, much like the Apostles in
Wisconsin, except the islands are closer together. That makes them ideal
for kayaking.</p>
<p>The Slate archipelago, where caribou live, attracts serious kayakers.
But the Rossport Islands are perfect for any paddler.</p>
<p>Two hours east of Thunder Bay, novices can explore the small islands
around Rossport's harbor, shielded from the big lake by a quartet of
large outer islands.</p>
<p>More adventurous paddlers can make their way out to a third tier of
islands, smaller but shielded from winds that blow from the north.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On one of those islands, there's a 1911 lighthouse, one of the last
Great Lakes lighthouses still tended by a keeper when it was automated
in 1991. The retired keeper would spend his summers tending its grounds, and
if he was in a good mood, he'd show visitors around.</p>
<p>One July, I paddled out to Battle Island with my husband and guide Aaron
Nicholson of Superior Outfitters in Rossport.</p>
<p>Islands rose in tiers around the harbor, and we headed for the gaps
between them.</p>
<p>We pulled into Wilson Island so my husband could adjust his foot rest,
and stepped out onto a magnificent cobblestone beach.</p>
<p>There were smooth, round stones in an array of colors and stripes, a
paradise for children and rockhounds, and I realized that this is what
every beach on Lake Superior must have looked like before tourists began
carting off the prettiest stones for landscaping.</p>
<p>A bald eagle burst from the trees as we paddled away. As we approached
Salter Island, the slight chop of the waves calmed into near glass.</p>

The beach of Wilson Island is filled with beautiful stones.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Lulled by the fair skies and easy paddling, I was surprised when
Nicholson pointed out a rock shoal nearing my bow, in the middle of the
channel. The islands provide haven, he said, but not necessarily safe
passage.</p>
<p>&quot;It's taken down some big ships,&quot; he said. &quot;Have you heard about
the Gunilda?&quot;</p>
<h3>Story of the Gunilda</h3>
<p>The Gunilda was an American luxury yacht that tried to sail into
Rossport in 1911. Its captain asked its owner, a New York oil baron, to
let him hire a local pilot to guide them around the shoals, but the
owner balked at the fee.</p>
<p>The yacht grounded, and a tug was called to pull it off. The tug captain
recommended that two boats be used to lift the 166-foot boat off the
rock, but the owner again refused to pay the extra cost.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>As soon as the Gunilda was pulled free, it sank in 265 feet of water,
with all its mahogany, crystal, china and fine wine.</p>
<p>Many people have tried to salvage it, Nicholson said, but so far they've
succeeded only in bringing up part of the mast, now the flagpole of the
Rossport Inn. Jacques Cousteau called it the most beautiful wreck in the
world.</p>
<p>The well-preserved wreck, its gold-leaf scrollwork clearly visible, is a
favorite site for technical divers, who call it &quot;the G spot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's fun to hear the stories,&quot; Nicholson said. &quot;There are still
people around here with a treasure-hunt mentality.&quot;</p>
<p>We pulled into Battle Island, had lunch on the curving harbor, then
walked down a spruce-lined path to the immaculate keeper's house and
tower. There was no sign of keeper Bert Saasto, and Nicholson warned us
that he doesn't always socialize with visitors.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/rossport_view_lighthouse.jpg" alt="The view from Battle Island lighthouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3>'The genuine article'</h3>
<p>But as we were hanging around on the lichen-covered point, admiring
clumps of deep-purple harebells nodding in the breeze, Saasto walked up.
We introduced ourselves, and he started talking about life on the rocks.</p>
<p>&quot;GPS put lighthouses out of business,&quot; he said with a wry smile. &quot;I
was the last keeper. I'm the genuine article.&quot;</p>
<p>Every September, Saasto had a helicopter pick him up and take him to
Thunder Bay for the winter.</p>
<p>But when he was working, he stayed through November, and he was on the
island during a 1977 storm in which 30- to 40-foot waves lifted fuel
tanks off their concrete cradles and pounding surf blew out the windows
of the tower, 70 feet above the lake.</p>
<p>&quot;The most frightening thing is the sound,&quot; he said. &quot;It's like a
freight train going by; it's deafening. That's what puts the fear of
God into you, the sound.&quot;</p>
<p>It wasn't the last storm he weathered during his 14 years as keeper.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;It's what they call a sublime experience — you're fascinated and
afraid at the same time,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>We'd just visited a half-dozen other Superior lighthouses, so we traded
stories for a while, and then he got his keys and opened the gates to
the tower, which we admired from the concrete helipad. Then he said,
&quot;Well, do you want to go up?&quot;</p>
<p>It was the first time Nicholson ever had been invited to climb the
tower. Battle Island Light never had a Fresnel lens, and when we reached
the top, we were surprised to see a bulb the size of a book light, a
100-watt halogen bulb with a revolving parabolic reflector —
low-tech, but still effective for 10 miles.</p>
<p>From the catwalk, we had a panoramic view of the islands, and we thought
we could see Isle Royale on the horizon, but Saasto said it was a
mirage.</p>
<p>&quot;You can't see below the horizon,&quot; he said. &quot;You can only see 30
miles, and it's 80 miles south until you hit Yankee Doodle land.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/rossport_lighthouse_keeper.jpg" alt="Bert Saasto is lighthouse keeper on Battle Island." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Battle Island, former lighthouse keeper Bert Saasto sat on concrete
cradles that once held fuel tanks, before waves carried them off during
a storm.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>By then, Saasto was getting warmed up. The lighthouse was removed on
nearby Talbot Island, which was called the Island of Doom, he said,
because three of its keepers died there. Of course, a keeper drowned on
Battle Island, too.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not for everyone,&quot; he said. &quot;Some people try it and go stir
crazy, but I always have a lot to keep me busy.&quot;</p>
<p>When we headed back, the waters still were calm. But when we emerged
into the Wilson Channel, the winds were coming from the north and also
the northwest, the only two directions from which islands don't protect
kayakers.</p>
<p>The waves were breaking every which way, and Nicholson called them
&quot;confused seas.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to read the water when the wind is breaking on the
islands,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It was hard work paddling, and several times waves filled my spray skirt
with water. But our 17½-foot sea kayaks didn't waver.</p>
<p>&quot;I've had waves hit me in the face and wash over my head, and the boat
is still very stable,&quot; Nicholson said.</p>
<p>It wasn't the free ride we got paddling out, but it was still a treat.
When we got back, he gave us a map of the islands and campsites, and
said we needed to come back for an overnight stay. It's already on our
list.</p>
