<h2>In a Wisconsin resort town, the wealthy built playrooms on water.</h2>

The boathouse at The Beacons was built in 1908.

<p>In Minocqua, you have to get in a boat to go on a historic home tour.</p>
<p>In the first part of the 20th century, captains of industry streamed to
this village in northeast Wisconsin, called the Island City because it
is nearly surrounded by Lake Minocqua.</p>
<p>Their estates are hidden in the trees, but the boathouses were built
over water, fanciful structures with gables, balconies, towers and
turrets.</p>
<p>They were the rec rooms of the rich: the Listerine heir, the matriarch
of a lumber fortune, a banking scion who became known as the Man in the
Iron Lung and the great-uncle of Elizabeth Taylor, who vacationed there
in her youth.</p>
<p>I found many of the historic boathouses while paddling along the
shoreline in a kayak, sharing the lake with hundreds of speedboats,
waverunners and pontoons but also loons and bald eagles.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I started out from the north bay of Lake Minocqua in a touring kayak
rented from Chequamegon Adventure Co. and carried across the highway to
the dock.</p>
<p>From there, I hugged the north shoreline, across from the beach at Torpy
Park, and saw a white boathouse that was part of an estate owned by
Stafford &quot;Casey&quot; Lambert, the heir to a St. Louis pharmaceutical
fortune built on Listerine.</p>
<p>Lambert was an aviator and engineer and first built the boathouse as a
hangar, said local historian Elcy Brooks.</p>
<p>&quot;He was quite a daredevil pilot,&quot; she added. &quot;He also had a car that
you could drive right off the dock and keep going. He used to fire a
cannon every day at 6 just to let everyone know it was 6.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minocqua_woolpy_boathouse.jpg" alt="The old Heinemann boathouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
This boathouse belonged to "Grandma" Heinemann, an avid musky
fisherman.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>With his friend Howard Young, a St. Louis art dealer and investor who
owned a home nearby, he often entertained Dwight Eisenhower, before and
during his presidency. Eisenhower, like Young's niece Elizabeth Taylor,
was an enthusiastic musky fisherman.</p>
<p>From the north bay, I paddled under the long trestle bridge that carries
bicyclists and joggers south on the Bearskin State Trail.</p>
<p>I'd forgotten a map, but I couldn't resist checking out a passage off
to the right, under a shorter bridge. Through the branches of a willow
tree, I saw a red-and-white boathouse with a second-floor balcony on
what I later learned was Lake Kawaguesaga.</p>
<p>It was &quot;Grandma&quot; Heinemann's 1920s boathouse, built from a Wausau
lumber and banking fortune. The second floor was a bedroom/playroom for
her children.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Now owned by another family, the boathouse bears the respectful
Sanskrit greeting Namaste on its side.</p>
<p>Farther down the lake, I joined four Chicago women in whitewater kayaks
who planned to portage around the Kawaguesaga dam to the Tomahawk River.
They invited me to join them, but I headed back for Lake Minocqua.</p>
<p>It was a warm, sunny Sunday, and powerboats zoomed around like gnats. A
few times I wondered if they were going to broadside my boat, but they
always veered away in time.</p>
<p>The loons were handling the traffic, and so did I. The next boathouse I
saw was built in 1908 with a &quot;lighthouse&quot; tower, right across the lake
from the Min-Aqua Bats bleachers and downtown.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minocqua_craftsman_boathouse.jpg" alt="Craftsman boathouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
This boathouse is not far from the U.S. 51 bridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was the estate of Fred Snite, the son of a Chicago financier who
contracted poliomyelitis on a trip to China. He had to spend the rest of
his life in an iron lung, but he lived with spirit; Brooks remembers him
watching movies at the local theater on a specially built platform, from
a mirror.</p>
<p>Today, the boathouse is part of The Beacons condo resort and is the dock
for the Minocqua Pontoon Cruises, which take passengers past many of the
other boathouses.</p>
<p>My next stop was a Craftsman-style beauty, with dormers on all four
sides of a peaked roof with a cupola and weather vane topped by a fish.
It's one of three Lake Minocqua boathouses on the National Register of
Historic Places and nine in Oneida County.</p>
<p>Farther down, I saw a red boathouse with a lighthouse-style tower; a
plaque identified it as Coy's Eagle's Nest. It was framed by tall
white pines; it's striking how many there are on the shores of Lake
Minocqua.</p>
<p>I passed the Coachlite Resort, started in 1920 as Warner's Circle Pines
and the last traditional resort where ordinary folks could rent a cottage
on the water. Its managers were enjoying the afternoon from its long
dock.</p>
<p>&quot;People want to keep it just the way it is,&quot; said Jane Teresinski,
who also owns one of the cabins.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minocqua_lambert_boathouse.jpg" alt="Lambert boathouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Pharmaceutical heir Casey Lambert first used his boathouse as a
floatplane hangar.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There were more boathouses on the water, many like cottages atop boat
parking. None can be rebuilt if they burn, and they can't be expanded,
but they can be maintained.</p>
<p>One looked like a northwoods Swiss chalet, with lattice railings and
window boxes filled with geraniums. Along with another forest-green
boathouse just down the shore, it was connected to the shore by a raised
walkway.</p>
<p>I saw more loons, and a juvenile bald eagle flew right over my bow. As I
paddled around a small wooded island, I saw two adult eagles flying in
tandem, making figure eights in the air between the shore and island.</p>
<p>Later, it was just one, carving endless loops over the island.</p>
<p>Then I passed back under the U.S. 51 bridge that connects the Island
City to the mainland, then under the trestle bridge and back to the
north bay.</p>
<p>Next time, I'll go on a weekday, when it's quieter. Still, it was fun
to be part of the go-go boating scene for which Minocqua is renowned.</p>
