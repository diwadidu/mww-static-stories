<h2>On the Wolf River in northeast Wisconsin, novice kayakers learn the moves at Bear Paw resort.</h2>

<p>Whitewater paddlers are, by definition, thrill-seekers.</p>
<p>That's why they seek out the northeast corner of Wisconsin, &quot;the
cradle of rivers.&quot; The big Wisconsin River starts there, as do the
Wolf, Peshtigo and Menominee, three of the Upper Midwest's best-known
whitewater rivers.</p>
<p>On the Wolf River, Bear Paw Outdoor Adventure Resort has been a
whitewater hub since 1994, selling gear to expert wranglers and teaching
novices how to handle the rapids that churn over knots of boulders
dropped by the last glacier.</p>
<p>The rapids are not all that dangerous, except when spring melt makes the
river run fast and furious. This is perhaps the most peaceful and
least-populated spot in Wisconsin, mostly national forest that returned
to the government when early settlers failed to make a living there.</p>
<h3>One of a kind</h3>
<p>It's not easy to find a resort like Bear Paw. It promotes the silent
sports of paddling and skiing in an area best known for hunting, fishing
and motorized sports. Its bar and restaurant is non-smoking.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It caters to guests of all incomes, housing them in whatever they can
afford-chalet suites, rustic cabins or the campground. It's
comfortable, not fancy, and friendly to beginners.</p>
<p>One summer, my 14-year-old son Peter and I went there to learn the
basics of whitewater kayaking. I wanted to try it myself, and
whitewater-kayaking is one of the few things a teen-age boy still will
do with his mother.</p>
<p>Our instructor was Scott Berry, who started out with an introduction to
the sport he calls &quot;super-addictive.&quot; Besides us, there were two
young couples, an older married couple from Illinois and a young man
from Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>Dave Hummel of Bloomington, Ill., had kayaked as a child, but the rest
of us were new to whitewater. Hummel said he'd stopped paddling when he
was 12, after an accident on a river in West Virginia.</p>
<p>&quot;I flipped over and hit my head, and I saw the fear,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the boat barn, we each picked out a 7½-foot river runner and a
paddle, spray skirt, wetsuit, life vest and helmet.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_kayaker.jpg" alt="A whitewater kayak class." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Unlike bicycle helmets, which are &quot;one use only,&quot; Berry said,
whitewater helmets are designed for repeated collisions of rocks with
heads. It was a sobering thought.</p>
<p>&quot;You <em>will</em> be upside down,&quot; he said.
&quot;You can get pretty scraped up.&quot;</p>
<p>On nearby Boulder Lake, we practiced the sweep, the draw and the forward
power stroke. And we practiced capsizing, whipping off our spray skirt,
tucking forward and tumbling out head first.</p>
<p>&quot;We're all between swims, that's my motto,&quot; said instructor
Jessica Parker. &quot;It can happen to anybody; you never know when.&quot;</p>
<p>Then she told us how to stay upright.</p>
<p>&quot;Always look for where you're going,&quot; she said. &quot;You've got to
plan ahead a little bit.</p>
<p>&quot;You're never going to win against the current, so you have to use its
power to your advantage. If you learn to read it, it's pretty much
always going to do the same thing.&quot;</p>

<h3>Tackling the river</h3>
<p>We launched ourselves into the Wolf River just across from the northern
border of the Menominee Indian Reservation. Using a ferry maneuver, we
paddled back and forth at the foot of rapids, angling our boats slightly
upstream to blunt the force of the water hitting the side of our boats.</p>
<p>Like billiards, whitewater kayaking is all about angles and approach. On
Class III and IV rapids, paddlers get out of their boats and study the
river, visualizing the course their boats should take through the water.</p>
<p>Our rapids were only Class I and II, but they were challenging enough.</p>
<p>In his dolphin-nosed playboat, instructor Berry played with them,
pivoting straight into the churning water as it tried to push him back.</p>
<p>Of course, Peter had to try that, too. But the water immediately grabbed
him and rolled him over, and when he came up, he had a strange look in
his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, my head hit a rock,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But he kept at it, taking turns with the other guys. When he finally
managed to nose his boat a few feet up the rapids, he raised his paddle
over his head in a &quot;Rocky&quot; moment.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_kayaker_peter.jpg" alt="Youth learns whitewater kayaking on Wolf River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>In calmer water, the rest of us practiced turning in the current and
bracing, leaning to the side as far as we could without tipping.</p>
<p>Bob Maloney of Roscoe, Ill., capsized twice and didn't pull off his
spray skirt either time. But he still managed to extricate himself from
his cockpit.</p>
<p>&quot;Panic works,&quot; he said ruefully.</p>
<p>When we'd finished practicing off our little beach, we lugged our
kayaks upstream to Gilmore's Mistake, a bend in the river with a
boulder garden that created logjams long before loggers arrived.</p>
<p>In fact, it's named for a logging-company scout who saw a natural logjam
that was so big the river disappeared under it and, assuming the river
was unnavigable, told his company not to buy the surrounding land.</p>
<p>Another company bought the land, dynamited the logjam, restored the flow
of the river and made a fortune.</p>
<p>Now, our job was to avoid getting hung up on the rocks, like the logs.</p>
<p>&quot;One thing's for sure, if you run into a rock, that's where most
people flip into the river,&quot; Parker said. &quot;The river is piling up on
your edge, and if you lean into it, the water will slide under your boat
and flip you.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;So hug the rock; it may even be good to hit the rock. If you learn to
lean into them now, you can avoid them later.&quot;</p>
<p>We could see the dark lines of an eddy, the calm water behind rocks. It
was a &quot;good&quot; eddy, and Parker told us to aim for it.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a train of waves, and if you follow them, that's where the
deeper water is,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Riding the white froth and dodging boulders with frantic power strokes,
we all made it through. Then we trudged back to do it again.</p>
<p>&quot;But don't go if you're tired,&quot; Berry said. &quot;It's like the last ski
run of the day; that's the one where you get hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>That evening, we had dinner in the restaurant while watching the locals
hoist a few beers.</p>
<p>It was Saturday night in the northwoods, with the usual hubbub and
hilarity, but something was different: There was no pall of smoke, the
music was alternative, and everyone looked fit and sun-kissed, as if
they'd walked out of the pages of Outside magazine.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Using the moves</h3>
<p>The next morning, we got into the van and put into the river at
Irrigation Ditch, 13 miles upstream from Gilmore's Mistake.</p>
<p>The first few miles were a breeze; we watched for eagles overhead and
for deer along the banks. Before each rapids, we'd duck over an eddy
line into calm water along the shore and confer. Then we'd go through,
one by one.</p>
<p>Gloria Maloney was having trouble, though, and finally, she figured out
why.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I've learned why I keep dumping on the river and he doesn't,&quot; she
said of her husband, Bob. &quot;I see the water coming and I lean into it,
like a dummy.&quot;</p>
<p>We pulled out at Langlade, then took the van back to Gilmore's Mistake,
whose jutting rocks no longer seemed all that menacing.</p>
<p>&quot;It really has some teeth in it when the water is high,&quot; Berry said.
&quot;Sometimes, we call the hole Big Daddy, but right now, it's more like
Little Daddy.&quot;</p>
<p>By now, Peter was a full-blown cowboy-high-level whitewater
competitions are called rodeos-so he went over the hole backward,
then tipped when he got to flatwater. He'd figured that
whitewater-kayaking is a lot like snowboarding, complete with face
plants.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like catching air, except you don't get any air,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm
just grinding and trying stuff out. It's fun.&quot;</p>
<p>Over the years, Bear Paw guides have learned that kids pick up the
skills fastest, mainly because they don't think as much as adults. After
our last lunch, I asked Peter what he'd learned in the class.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I wasn't really paying attention to the technical strokes,&quot; he
said. &quot;I just did what seemed natural and what worked.&quot;</p>
