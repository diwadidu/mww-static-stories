</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Wausau, water is power.</p>
<p>Sawmills were first to use the thundering rapids along the Wisconsin
River, which have been working hard ever since.</p>
<p>But these rapids generate more than the electricity that lights a bulb
— they also draw world-class athletes for thrilling tournaments, such
the world whitewater kayak/canoe championships for juniors and
under-23 paddlers, some of them Olympics-bound.</p>
<p>Watching super-fit young athletes from 26 countries try to tame
Wausau's &quot;spinning, churning washing-machine of a river&quot; was the
most fun we've ever had watching a sport.</p>
<p>Charging down the channel, they rode the bucking waves like
bronco-busters, making their boats heel around giant boulders and slide
through 23 gates, often upstream, as their teammates ran alongside
screaming &quot;Up-up-up-up-UP!&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>No one was perfect on the raging water. But some, like 17-year-old
Jessica Fox, the daughter of two world champions, were very, very good.
Less than three weeks later, she won a silver medal for Australia at the
London Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>Wausau's Whitewater Park, a usually quiet channel that boils when it
gets massive infusions of water from the upstream dam, opened in 1975.</p>
<p>It's just one asset of this sporty town, which also hosts the Badger
State Winter Games and, the weekend we were there, the state fast-pitch
tournament.</p>
<p>It's got an alpine-ski hill, a Nordic-skiing course, and a large curling center.</p>
<p>The 1,000-mile Ice Age National Scenic Trail goes past town. There's
more hiking on Rib Mountain, which rises out of the river plain like a
volcanic caldera and was the highest point in Wisconsin until Timm's
Hill near Ogema was surveyed at 12 feet higher.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wausau_chalkfest_afghani.jpg" alt="A Chalkfest artist in Wausau." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Wausau only has 39,000 people, but it knows how to have a good time.
When we got there on Friday evening, the big town square known as the
400 Block was filled with people and artists starting their sidewalk
compositions for Chalkfest, which drew 250 entries.</p>
<p>We were there to take the waters — on the whitewater course, on its
beaches and in its breweries.</p>
<p>Wausau is a heavily German town. Its first mayor, a grocer from Germany,
arrived in town and then went back for another 702 people. So it's not
hard to find a good beer, and our first stop was Red Eye Brewing, a
brewpub on the east edge of downtown.</p>
<p>It had a college vibe, with a high ceiling hung with a collection of
rare and vintage bicycles from one of the brewmaster's friends. Our
perky young server offered to get me extras if I didn't like any of the
four samples in my flight of ales, but I liked them all.</p>
<p>The hit of our meal was made with the European favorite Nutella; it was
a freshly baked, warm calzone spread with the chocolate-hazelnut paste
and dusted with powdered sugar. We'd go back to Wausau just for that.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At 9 a.m., streets still were full of strolling people, and marquee
lights were blinking on the Grand and Fillmor theaters.</p>
<p>In the morning, we parked ourselves behind judges on the 250-meter
whitewater course, close enough to the water to see straining muscles
and gritting teeth.</p>
<p>A kayaker from Poland was on the course, and his teammates sounded like
a flock of hens, shouting high-pitched encouragement meant to carry over
the thunder of waves.</p>
<p>Judges watched intently to see if he'd touch a pole (minus two points)
or miss a gate (minus 50 points). His performance was like a dance,
except the raging currents didn't allow choreography.</p>
<p>Strategy, we noticed, is as important as strength. A boulder sat in
front of one of the gates closest to us, so there were two ways to
approach it: from the right, the less-tricky way, or from the left,
which was harder but faster.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wausau_us_relay.jpg" alt="Kayakers in Wausau's Whitewater Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The next gate was at the bottom of a sharp drop, which paddlers had to
plop down sideways if they wanted to quickly reach the gate and paddle
through it upstream.</p>
<p>If they allowed themselves to go even a meter downstream, they had to
spend precious seconds and strength to paddle back into position.</p>
<p>Whitewater Park is unusual in that it's in the middle of an urban area.
At lunchtime, we walked over to the adjoining farmers market and then
downtown, where pastel portraits were emerging on sidewalks: Minnie
Mouse, Rosie the Riveter, Willy Wonka, the Scooby Doo crew.</p>
<p>Shopping streets radiate from the 400 Block. One was lined with men's
clothiers, a cupcake bakery, a coffeehouse, a yogurt shop, a pub and a
clay studio.</p>
<p>Another had a chocolate shop, a deli, a bookstore, a gourmet grocery, a
garden gift shop-and a bright-red English telephone booth.</p>
<p>The cupcake shop, Sweet Lola's, was particularly wicked, with homemade
Ho-Hos, Oreos and cheesecake pops as well as lavishly iced cakes and ice
cream. It was the perfect place to go if you'd just expended 3,000
calories fighting the currents on a whitewater course.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wausau_sweet_street.jpg" alt="Shops in downtown Wausau." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Shopping streets radiate from the 400 Block downtown.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Back on the river, we watched French, Czechs, British, Slovenian and
American teams in semifinals. The team races were especially fun, with
three boats on the course at the same time, trying to stay as close as
possible without &quot;trading paint.&quot;</p>
<p>With three paddlers to amass penalties, it was devilishly hard to score
a good time, and all boats had to cross the finish line within 15
seconds of each other.</p>
<p>We had a lot to do after the day's races finished. From downtown, we
headed through the east side and the Andrew Warren Historic District —
those early lumber barons made a lot of money and built some gorgeous
homes — to the Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum.</p>
<p>Endowed by a lumber baron's heir, this nature-centric museum is free
and family-friendly. In the Art Park downstairs, a father was making
tissue flowers with his daughter, and a mom was &quot;planting&quot; her baby
in a flower pot and topping him with a sunflower costume for photos.</p>
<p>Then we drove to Briq's, part of the chain of soft-serve stands founded in 1985
by the late Dan Briquelet of Wausau. We hoped to see someone order the
infamous One-Pound Cone, but we had to settle for a view of the large,
which was pretty big.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I always order a twist cone, and mine was as good as they come, dense
and ice-cold. But I was tempted by the fresh strawberry or raspberry
shakes and fresh strawberry rhubarb sundae, offered only during picking
season.</p>
<p>From the Merrill Avenue Briq's, we zipped down the highway to Rib
Mountain, a towering heap of hard quartzite that's stood up against 2
billion years of lapping oceans, wind and erosion.</p>
<p>Hiking trails weave around the mountain, whose north face is used by
Granite Peak ski area, and we walked through the woods until mosquitoes
chased us out.</p>
<p>Then it was on to Bull Falls Brewery in a residential-industrial area.
Wausau first was known as Big Bull Falls, likely for the French word
<em>bulle,</em> for the bubbles in the rapids.</p>
<p>The brewery was holding a jazz festival, part of a summer-long series,
and I tried the Zwickel Bier — an unfiltered lager, bready but the
hoppiest beer the German-style brewery offers — while listening to a
Dixieland band.</p>
<p>It was a friendly place. The tap room was standing-room only, but people
at one table offered us extra chairs and plied us with peanuts.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wausau_phone_booth.jpg" alt="A shopping street in Wausau." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
An English phone booth stands across from the Back When Cafe.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From there, we drove over to the airport for the Balloon Rally &amp;
Glow, but the hot-air balloons had been grounded by wind. We listened to
a band for a while and watched a biplane give &quot;barnstormer&quot; rides,
then headed for our third brewery.</p>
<p>The Great Dane Pub &amp; Brewery is an outpost of the well-known Madison
pub. Our mahi-mahi with couscous and Japanese sushi roll with noodle
salad was only okay, but the beer was good, and the music was really good.</p>
<p>Our power-sightseeing gave us the whole next day to watch the races. We
saw Australia's Jessica Fox win her third gold medal and her second
world junior kayaking title, and the U.S. and Canadian teams go home
disappointed.</p>
<p>We almost stayed for the 6 p.m. water-ski show on Lake Wausau but
instead made our way home, stopping for a dip at Man Made in Lake
Sunnyvale Park on the west edge of town.</p>
<p>We loved all of Wausau's waters, and we were looking for a reason to
return even before we left.</p>
<p>If you want to see the whitewater course in action, or paddle it
yourself, you have to plan; water is released only a few times a year
and for tournaments.</p>
