<h2>For canoeists, this vast wilderness is the promised land.</h2>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Along Minnesota's northern border with Canada, more than 200,000 people
a year find an increasingly rare commodity — absolute wilderness.</p>
<p>The million-acre Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness is barely changed
since voyageurs used its chain of lakes and rivers to push deep into the
continent's interior.</p>
<p>Today, the foot trails over which they carried canoes and 180-pound
packs are used by vacationers, who wind their way from lake to lake in
search of the perfect combination of woods, water and solitude.</p>
<p>As they paddle along the glassy waters of more than 1,000 lakes, they
may see moose, lynx, otters and beaver, who have rebounded from
near-extinction at the hands of trappers.</p>
<p>In the evening, at nearly 2,200 campsites, they listen for the trill of
loons and the howl of wolves, whose numbers also have rebounded.</p>
<p>It's the stuff of memories, to be fondly savored back in civilization.</p>
<p>To people who consider the Midwest flyover land, the BWCA puts Minnesota
on the map. National Geographic Traveler listed it as one of 50 Places
of a Lifetime/The World's Greatest Destinations, along with the Grand
Canyon and Big Sur.</p>
<p>In the book &quot;1,000 Places to See Before You Die,&quot; it's the only
Minnesota entry.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Whenever I travel outside the Midwest, people I meet always scan their
brains for whatever they know about Minnesota, then ask, &quot;Have you been
to the Boundary Waters?&quot;</p>
<p>When I finally took a week to paddle there, I was surprised. The
portages I'd imagined as grassy paths through the forest were muddy
up-and-down trails studded with boulders and choked with tree roots; the
first day, we carried our gear over nearly two miles of them.</p>
<p>And once we were at the campsite, everything took a lot of time —
filtering water, washing dishes off in the woods, protecting food from
the chipmunk we knew was lurking and any bear that might be.</p>
<p>Being in the Boundary Waters is work. But there's no place better.</p>
<p>Some people love the BWCA for its solitude, some for its scenery. As it
turned out, I loved the water.</p>
<p>Once I realized I could swim anywhere, any time, I took to the black,
glassy water, sometimes floating motionlessly to watch loons, sometimes
diving underwater to feel the rush of cool, clean water along my skin.</p>
<p>There are few weeds here, because there is so little soil. Glaciers
ground up the softer rock and carried it down to Iowa.</p>
<p>What's left is a stripped-down landscape of sky, spruce and outcroppings
of greenstone and granite, among the hardest and oldest rock on Earth.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/w/bwcaw_campsite.jpg" alt="A campsite on Tuscarora Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

the Gunflint Trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>All that rock and water create acoustics worthy of an orchestra hall. We
could hear every ringing note of loon calls; over the week, we heard
their whole lexicon, and wished desperately for a dictionary.</p>
<p>We heard the howls of wolves on one side of lake, and the answers from
the other. When people a mile away started singing and playing a guitar,
we could pick out words.</p>
<p>The Boundary Waters are serene, but hardly silent. At night, the sawing
of crickets provides white noise, along with the steady squeaking of
bark beetles and the whine of mosquitoes, revving up like tiny Harleys.</p>
<p>One evening, while we were eating dinner under clear skies, we heard a
hum, like faraway traffic, and looked up. It grew louder, but we saw
nothing; then, a wall of mist rounded the corner of the next bay like a
horizontal waterfall.</p>
<p>As we watched, puzzled, a few drops fell on our heads, and the skies
opened. Twenty minutes later, we got a rainbow.</p>
<p>People sometimes make fewer appearances than wildlife, sometimes more.
When we paddled onto Tuscarora Lake, the first eight campsites were
occupied, but we saw only an occasional far-off canoe until the last
day, when a canoe came to explore our bay.</p>
<p>We saw more people the day we canoed through four small lakes on our way
to Little Saganaga, but not many: two fishermen in the shadows of
Saganaga's cliffs, a family playing on the rapids between Crooked and
Tarry lakes.</p>
<p>We met the family a day later, during a sudden downpour on the Owl Lake
portage. They hadn't looked like typical BWCA types, in their baggy
T-shirts and cotton pants, but Rick and Elaine Wrack of Avon, Minn., had
been coming every year for 30 years.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;We met on a high-school trip to the BWCA, and we've been coming here
ever since,&quot; Rick Wrack said. &quot;And I'll keep coming till my bones are
creaking.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And then we'll have to drag them here,&quot; added their 12-year-old
nephew, Tim Marshall of Laporte, Minn.</p>
<p>They'd also been in the BWCA during the deadly blow-down of 1999, Elaine
Wrack said. &quot;So this is nothing, just a little water,&quot; she said,
cheerfully stuffing her pack as the rain soaked her clothes.</p>
<p>There is, of course, no typical BWCA visitor. The first person we saw,
on the portage to Tuscarora, was wearing a birchbark top hat.</p>
<p>The last people we saw were teen-age girls shrieking and bobbing atop
the water, wearing their life vests &quot;like diapers,&quot; they told us when
we asked.</p>
<p>There's not really a &quot;right&quot; way to be in the Boundary Waters. Torsten
and I packed ultra light, bringing only some dried apricots for a treat.
But after I got back, a friend of my niece's told me about a different
approach.</p>
<p>She'd been to the Boundary Waters that month, too, but she and her six
girlfriends had carried in foam fun noodles, blow-up rafts, boxed wine
and Bop-It electronic party games. They were particularly glad, she
said, to have the rafts.</p>
<p>Next time, I'm bringing chocolate bars.</p>

<h3>Planning a trip</h3>
<p>The easiest way for a beginner to go to the Boundary Waters is with a
group or a friend who has good gear to share — lightweight tent, stove
and water filter, in addition to the lightweight sleeping bag, sleeping
pad, Duluth pack and Nalgene bottles you'll each need.</p>
<p>We own a good fiberglass canoe, but we splurged and rented a lightweight
Kevlar canoe that turned out to be a godsend on the grueling, 1½-mile
Tuscarora portage, which we did in a single trip — 40 minutes,
compared with the two hours it took two men we met.</p>
<p>It's even easier to drive up to Ely or the North Shore with a credit
card and let someone else take care of everything.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless you go in with someone who has all the gear, I'd say spend the
money to go with an outfitter,&quot; says wilderness expert Tom Kaffine.
&quot;They are pricey, but they'll let you know if you like it or not, before
you buy all the gear.&quot;</p>
<p>The thing that makes the Boundary Waters truly egalitarian, however, is
that it doesn't cost anything to be there, beyond the permit. <a href="https://www.friends-bwca.org/blog/diy-guide-to-doing-the-bwca-on-the-cheap">Gear
doesn't have to be
expensive</a>. And trips needn't be backbreaking treks deep into the interior.</p>
<p>The Friends of the Boundary Waters offers seven <a href="https://www.friends-bwca.org/2-day-bwca-canoe-routes">two-day
routes</a> that are
good introductions to canoe camping in the BWCAW. And here are six
<a href="https://www.friends-bwca.org/5-day-bwca-canoe-routes">five-day routes</a>.</p>
<p>Some people, like my niece's friend, make just one short portage and
then set up a base camp.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Those people, however, sacrifice solitude and privacy, and it can be
hard to find a campsite.</p>
<p>There's a lot to consider when planning a BWCA trip. Luckily, there are
dozens of guidebooks and plenty of people willing to give advice at
outdoors and sporting goods stores.</p>
<p>The Friends of the Boundary Waters offer a <a href="https://www.friends-bwca.org/blog/planning-a-boundary-waters-trip">step-by-step planning
guide</a>.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Forest Service stations in Tofte, Grand Marais, Ely and
Cook, rangers are fonts of advice.</p>
<p>They'll supply handy tips on gear, suggesting things many canoeists
don't think about bringing, such as a collapsible wash basin, an extra
paddle, boots for portages.</p>
<p>They also give safety tips. Rangers often are concerned about fire
danger created by dead stumps from blow-downs.</p>
<p>January is the time to reserve a permit if you're on your own and want
to use one of the more popular entry points — that is, one near the
shortest and easiest portages that lead to the largest variety of
lakes.</p>
<p>But if you can't plan that far ahead, don't worry. We didn't get our
permit until two weeks before we left in August, and we ended up with a
secluded campsite on a beautiful lake. And outfitters always have plenty
of permits for their customers.</p>
<p>The important thing is to go out and get your feet wet.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness</h3>
<p><em>When to go</em> : Early June generally is the height of black-fly season,
depending on how early spring arrives. Bring hats with netting,
available at outfitters.</p>
<p>July and August are peak season, but expect some bugs. May and September
can be sunny and warm or it can snow; anything is possible.</p>
<p><em>Who can go</em> : Nine people and four watercraft are the maximum allowed
per party.</p>
<p><em>Camping</em> : It's first-come, first-served, and allowed only at
designated sites, which have fire grates and wilderness latrines.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/w/bwca_portage.jpg" alt="A man portages a canoe in the Boundary Waters." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In the Boundary Waters, portage trails can be long and often are rocky.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Entry points</em> : There are 64 overnight-entry points from the perimeter
of the BWCA, including the North Shore, the Gunflint Trail, Ely and the
Lake Vermilion area.</p>
<p><em>Routes</em> : Possibilities are endless. The <a href="https://www.friends-bwca.org/">Friends of the Boundary
Waters</a> suggest these <a href="https://www.friends-bwca.org/blog/four-bwca-canoe-routes">four
loops</a>, and
also offers a <a href="https://www.friends-bwca.org/explore/plan-a-trip/">trip-planning
tool</a>.</p>
<p><em>Making a reservation</em> : Reserve early for the best choice of entry
permits into the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/superior/specialplaces/?cid=fseprd555184">Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness</a>. For stays between May 1 and Sept. 30, entry permits can be reserved,
first-come, first-served, starting <strong>the last Wednesday of January</strong>
at <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/permits/233396">Recreation. gov</a>,
877-444-6777.</p>
<p>You may want to list alternate leaders on your permit, so others can
pick them up if needed.</p>
<p><em>Fees</em> : The non-refundable reservation fee is $6 for overnight trips
as well as day-use motorized trips to designated lakes.</p>
<p>Per-person, per-trip user fees are $16, $8 for children to age 17.</p>
<p><em>Getting a permit</em> : They can be picked up at 70 resorts, outfitters,
YMCA camps, bait shops and Forest Service offices, as specified by the
person making the reservation.</p>
<p>These stations also issue non-reserved permits, if available. Credit
cards are required for balance due; only Forest Service offices can
accept cash and checks.</p>
<p><em>Self-issuing permits</em> : Forms for day use or overnight trips between
Oct. 1 and April 30 can be picked up at main entry points, at outfitters
and Superior National Forest offices and by mail. Carry a copy during
the trip.</p>
<p><em>Maps</em> : You'll need to carry a map. They're available from outfitters
or from the <a href="http://www.fishermaps.com/">W.A. Fisher Co</a>.,
