<h2>In northwest Wisconsin, this lively river is cherished by presidents, paddlers, fishermen and wildlife-watchers.</h2>

<p>More than any other river in Wisconsin, the Bois Brule has a pedigree.</p>
<p>They call it River of Presidents, but it also attracts senators and
millionaires. Named for pines charred by lightning strikes-&quot;burnt
wood&quot; in Ojibwe, then French-it rises from conifer bogs near Solon
Springs and flows toward Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Its cold, spring-fed currents harbor trout, and well-heeled fishermen
discovered the river long before loggers moved in.</p>
<p>They built the first lodges in the 1870s, when Ulysses S. Grant came to
visit, followed by Grover Cleveland in the 1880s. In the 1890s, St.
Louis oil and rail tycoon Henry Clay Pierce amassed 4,160 acres along
the river and built a fishing retreat.</p>
<p>President Calvin Coolidge spent the entire summer of 1928 there, fishing
for trout raised in Pierce's private hatchery, where they reportedly
were fed beef liver.</p>
<p>Coolidge had decided not to run for re-election, and he hosted
presidential candidate Herbert Hoover. John G. Ordway later bought
Pierce's estate, and in 1947, he hosted Gen. Dwight Eisenhower for some
post-war R&amp;R.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The rich and powerful still relax on the Brule. But these days, the poor
and ordinary outnumber them. On hot summer days, they descend on the
river in canoes and kayaks, bumping through a long series of rapids as
it drops 420 feet toward Lake Superior.</p>
<p>We joined them one July, renting kayaks from Brule River Canoe Rental in
Brule. As we drove along forest roads toward Stones Bridge, veteran
outfitter Roger Salomaki groused good-naturedly about the crowds.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you see why I go crazy,&quot; he said. &quot;I haven't had a day off for six
weeks. I just keep rolling and rolling. I've put in more than a million
miles on these roads.&quot;</p>
<p>We passed a small air strip, and Salomaki said he expected the Carlson
Companies' Lear jet to arrive soon.</p>
<p>&quot;Marilyn Nelson and Barbara (Carlson Gage) like to canoe, and of course,
I go with them,&quot; he said. He nodded in the opposite direction. &quot;The
Ordways have their own little strip,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The landing was choked with people, canoes and coolers, but in kayaks,
we quickly put them behind us. A boulder garden lined our path, and
rocks underneath were streaked with silver from aluminum canoes.</p>
<p>The water was low, and we had to watch where we were going.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/o/bois_brule_canoe.jpg" alt="A wooden canoe on the Bois Brule." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We would have missed the gigantic eagle's nest overhead if high-pitched
screeching hadn't alerted us to it. A juvenile bald eagle was agitated
and flapping its wings, but soon it settled down to survey the river.</p>
<p>On the banks, lofty cedars created needle-carpeted clearings. Lacy
clumps of forget-me-not, adorable but invasive, grew amid the grasses.</p>
<p>The first sign of the populated part of the river was an imposing red
and green boathouse, with brass acanthus sconces for lighting: &quot;Private
Property. No Trespassing. J.G. Ordway.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the start of Cedar Island Lodge, refuge of presidents, and we
gawked as much as the current would allow.</p>
<p>A deer bounded across the sloping lawn of the main house, set back from
the water, but we had to turn our attention to the rustic timber
footbridge ahead, which connected a low, cedar-sided building to a
hideaway on the island.</p>
<p>We were still gawking when we came across state-forest ranger Edward
Culhane standing in the middle of the river, politely waving down canoes
to check for unsecured cans and gear.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm afraid if you tip, it's all gonna go,&quot; he told two young women
whose lunch was scattered around their cooler.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the next canoe, two men from Minnesota had glass bottles, for which
they received a $148 ticket, and no fishing license they could show,
which would earn them a $180 ticket if, upon checking later, Culhane
found they had fibbed about having one.</p>
<p>Culhane does this all day, he says, &quot;here and there&quot; along the river's
44 miles. We hadn't seen any litter yet, so he must be doing a good
job.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually, it's not too bad,&quot; he said. &quot;People are just having fun.&quot;</p>
<p>We squeezed through The Falls and Twin Rapids, then emerged into Big
Lake. We saw more old but elegant boathouses, with Adirondack chairs
arranged on docks, and gracious old lodges blending into the trees.</p>
<p>We passed Swiftwater Farm, the beloved retreat of Elisabeth Congdon of
Duluth's Glensheen fame, and Muskikiwiininn Lodge, which had a
boathouse sheathed in a nifty cedar-bark fringe.</p>
<p>It felt like a museum tour of turn-of-the-century cabins, with logs
darkened by age, boulder foundations, gables, timber rails and long
porches with opaque screens. Even the No Trespassing signs looked
vintage.</p>
<p>There wasn't a McMansion in sight-no three-car garages, no
Escalades, no ostentation at all-and yet we knew that many of these
owners have plenty of money. There was nothing but the serene beauty we
might have seen 100 years ago.</p>

bottles and fishing without a license.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Nearly all of the longtime property owners on the Upper Brule have put
their land under conservation easements, and we felt profoundly grateful
to them.</p>
<p>We saw Culhane again at the next landing, near a sign that read
&quot;Winneboujou Club. Protected with cooperation of the Nature
Conservancy.&quot; Many of the lodges we saw do have all the modern
luxuries, he said, but owners maintain the original exteriors.</p>
<p>&quot;They go to great lengths to keep them the way they were,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Dave Schulz, the forest's acting superintendent, says that properties
rarely come up for sale, and if one does, other owners quickly buy it.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a real big conservation ethic along the river,&quot; he says. &quot;It's
a great thing. Ninety percent of the owners have family connections on
the river going back a century.&quot;</p>
<p>After nine miles of dodging rocks, we were starting to get tired, but
then we spotted a preening merganser with 19 ducklings lined up next to
her on a fallen log.</p>
<p>We wheeled around and paddled in place, watching, until they plopped
into the water one by one, the babies playfully jostling each other and
snapping their bills at insects.</p>
<p>My husband hung behind to watch as they paddled across the river.</p>
<p>&quot;Those ducks make the day for me,&quot; he said. &quot;They're cute beyond
belief.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/o/bois_brule_merganser_brood.jpg" alt="merganser ducks sit on log in Bois Brule River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We got out to stretch at Bois Brule Campground and saw Culhane driving
off in his pickup. At the 12-mile mark, we arrived at the U.S. 2 landing
just outside Brule, a rowdy logging town turned paddling hub.</p>
<p>The next day, we decided to try a canoe on the eight-mile stretch from
Wisconsin 13 to Lake Superior.</p>
<p>This time, our driver was young Adam Helbach, who grew up in nearby
Maple. Tubing once was allowed on the river, he said, but the state
outlawed it because too much garbage ended up in the river.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a lot of people who really, really want to protect the river
any way they can,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It didn't take long for us to figure out the canoe was a mistake. The
water was too low, and it was impossible to avoid the gantlets of
boulders. More than once, we scraped right over one, and we offered a
mental apology to the outfitters.</p>
<p>The landscape had changed, too. The cedars were gone, and tall, red-clay
banks rose from water that had turned cloudy. The forget-me-nots had
been joined by a whole garden-buttercup, anemone, wild rose, daisies
and tall stands of yellow flag.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Soon we saw orange buoys marking the top of a barrier that serves as a
ladder for migrating fish and also keeps out the sea lamprey, which
clamps onto trout and sucks their blood.</p>
<p>We got out and portaged around it, and as we paddled on, a juvenile bald
eagle dropped out of a tree in front of us, clumsily flapping upriver.
An adult flew the other way and sat in a tree directly overhead as we
passed.</p>
<p>The going got hairier and hairier, the boulders as thick as teeth on a
comb. At one point we got stuck on a rock, and we were glad no one was
filming us for &quot;America's Funniest Home Videos.&quot;</p>
<p>But it could have been worse. The French explorer Daniel Greysolon,
Sieur du Lhut, traversed the Brule in 1680 and wrote, &quot;having cut down
some trees and broken through about 100 beaver dams, I went up said
river . . .&quot;</p>
<p>Frequent eagle sightings improved our mood. We passed a newer cabin, a
farmhouse and a boathouse covered by murals. Then the air turned chilly
and a seagull wheeled overhead.</p>
<p>Rounding a corner, we saw a long sandbar and, beyond it, Lake Superior.
John Jacob Astor's American Fur Company operated a fish camp here in
1839, and in 1880, English immigrants tried to establish a cooperage and
fish-shipping business.</p>
<p>It failed, and soon loggers took over, rafting the river's pines to
mills in Duluth.</p>

<p>Today, the entire river is part of Brule River State Forest, which
celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2007. Started with 4,320 acres
deeded by lumber baron Frederick Weyerhaeuser, who had an estate on
nearby Lake Nebagamon, it has grown to 47,000 acres.</p>
<p>In 2007, with help from the Conservation Fund, the state acquired nearly
6,000 acres, much of it just south of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>&quot;I think this is going to be a coming region for those who are seeking
recreation,&quot; Calvin Coolidge said in 1928.</p>
<p>It's a lucky man who spends a whole summer on the Brule. Two days is
good, but not nearly enough for a river with so much character.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Paddling the Bois Brule</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : Brule is about half an hour east of Superior on U.S.
2.</p>
<p><em>Paddling</em> : The 12-mile paddle from Stones Bridge to Brule takes five
to six hours. When water is low, go for kayaks.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/r/brule_boathouse.jpg" alt="A boathouse on the Bois Brule." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The river is lined with vintage boathouses.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The eight-mile trip from Highway 13 to Lake Superior takes three hours
or less. The eight miles from U.S. 2 to Pine Tree Landing is placid, but
the following eight miles to Highway 13 are nearly continuous rapids,
for experienced paddlers only.</p>
