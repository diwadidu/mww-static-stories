<h2>Near the northeast Wisconsin town of Mercer, paddling is as wild as you want it to be.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/e/mercer_paddling.jpg" alt="Paddling in the Turtle Flambeau." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Paddling in the Turtle Flambeau Flowage.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the northeast corner of Wisconsin, a vast, amoeba-shaped body of
water spreads over 37,000 acres of state-owned land.</p>
<p>Rivers run through it, the Turtle and the Flambeau. They were dammed to
create a flowage in 1926, and today it's a state scenic waters area,
designated for boating, fishing and camping.</p>
<p>Hundreds of islands and secluded bays provide habitat for bald eagles,
osprey and loons, who outnumber the paddlers who pull up to rustic
campsites.</p>
<p>The Turtle-Flambeau Flowage is a little like Minnesota's Boundary
Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, except it's easier to reach, permits
aren't required and there are only two portages.</p>
<p>Call it Boundary Waters Lite.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Motorboats are allowed, so canoeists and kayakers looking for absolute
quiet may not find it. Even so, they may be tempted by the trade-off —
the resort town of Mercer is just 15 minutes away, with its ice cream,
fish fries and one of the region's best arrays of mix-and-match craft
beer.</p>
<p>The eastern fifth of the flowage is a voluntary, no-wake &quot;quiet
area&quot; served by a shallow-water boat access that's off the beaten
path. That's the most &quot;wilderness&quot; part of the flowage.</p>
<p>But the area is so vast that it absorbs boat traffic, mostly seen around
landings.</p>
<p>One Labor Day weekend, we put our kayaks into the water at busy
Fisherman's Landing, and soon we were sitting in a virtually hidden
inland lake, watching two sandhill cranes in the rushes, one feeding and
one standing sentinel.</p>
<p>We'd found it by circling Swimmers Island and ducking into a little
channel. It looked like good eagle habitat, too — and sure enough,
there was one sitting on the branch of a white pine.</p>

Campers on Swimmers Island near Fisherman's Landing.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We found out the name of the island from a group of pontoon boaters
having a picnic on a pretty ridge. We weren't exactly sure where we
were, and after checking a map and telling us, they invited us up for a
beer and a brat.</p>
<p>But we had our own lunch, which we ate on a cobblestone beach where two
driftwood logs formed a bench.</p>
<p>On the other side of the island, we saw a couple of guys sitting
contentedly next to a cooler and shaded by a tarp.</p>
<p>They'd been coming for 30 years in summer and  fall, including during
the July 2010 blowdown, and have seen the landscape shift and change.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a great place, one of our favorites,&quot; said Joe Wag, who had
driven up from McFarland, Wis.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>His friend Glenn Weihert, of neighboring Middleton, says they've shared
space with bear, deer and even larger wildlife.</p>
<p>&quot;One year, we had a moose on the island with us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Their favorite spot, F13, was taken, so they'd settled on R17. Sites
with an &quot;F&quot; means there's a picnic table, like F7 on a  beautiful
point occupied by two tents.</p>
<p>We were staying in town, but we were developing a case of campsite envy.</p>
<p>Just 10 miles away, Mercer is a longtime lake resort town. During
Prohibition, its remoteness was prized by Chicago gangsters, who
vacationed there. One of its citizens was Ralph Capone, who kept the
books for his brother Al and served two years for tax evasion.</p>
<p>When he got out of jail, he came to Mercer, along with his mother, wife,
mistress, and various cousins and associates. After Prohibition, he ran
a bar and, by all accounts, was loved by everyone.</p>

<p>Capone is part of Mercer lore, along with his bagman Einer, who had a
pet muskie called Stupid that he fed every night. Locals knew that if
you caught Stupid, you put him back fast.</p>
<p>Today, tourists know Mercer mainly as the home of Clair d'Loon, a
16-foot-tall fiberglass bird with beady red eyes on the south edge of
town.</p>
<p>Downtown, there's everything a lake town needs: ice-cream and bait
shops, a coffeehouse, souvenir and antiques stores and a bunch of bars.</p>
<p>It also boasts Snow's Family Market, where we found a selection of
perhaps 200 kinds of craft beer, plus really good baked goods and
specialty bratwurst made on-site.</p>
<p>The next day, we went to Lake of the Falls County Park, a popular
campground on the north edge of the flowage. The water at the foot of a
10-foot falls was buzzing with boats — paddleboats, kayaks, canoes,
rafts, pontoons — and families played on a small sand beach.</p>
<p>From there, we paddled into the flowage along the Turtle River. A few
cabins lined the high, wooded banks, but soon the horizon widened and
the breeze picked up.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Even on a holiday weekend, there were only a few other kayaks and
fishing boats. We hugged the shore and dipped into reedy bays, flushing
a wood duck and passing a swan-shaped stump.</p>
<p>When the area was flooded in 1926, the water topped 16 lakes and created
377 islands. Today, it's a maze of water and woods.</p>
<p>You can get a taste on day trips. It takes a little longer to find
wilderness spots, but in this rambling flowage, there's a nook or
cranny for everyone.</p>
