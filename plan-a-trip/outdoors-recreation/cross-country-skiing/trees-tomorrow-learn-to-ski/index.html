<h2>At Trees for Tomorrow, beginning skiers get the push they need.</h2>
<p>Sometimes, a person who wants to look slick has to look stupid first.</p>
<p>Standing in the snow one morning in February, I and 10 other skiers walked like gorillas, bouncing on our thighs. We rolled our hips like hula queens and stuck out our arms as if we were practicing tai chi on the beach. We used lobster grips and pretended to cross a creek, hopping from boulder to boulder.</p>
<p>It was all at the bidding of Sandy Lotto, who learned Alpine skiing before she was 3 and was an expert at that until, at 22, she tried cross-country skiing as an intern naturalist at Trees for Tomorrow in Eagle River, Wis. Now, Lotto skis in every spare moment, racing and also teaching around Wisconsin's north woods.</p>
<p>``I lucked out; it changed my life,'' she says, with a modest laugh.</p>
<p>One February, she taught a women's ski clinic at Trees for Tomorrow, an environmental-learning center with its own oval ski track. After morning exercises, we got into the striding tracks and went back and forth, our pole straps tightened over our knuckles, bending forward from the waist, swinging our arms as we tried to stretch out our glides. It turns out the gorilla practice was useful, after all.</p>
<p>``If you learn only one thing this weekend, it should be to keep your arms low and relaxed,'' Lotto said. ``If you do that, you'll be worlds ahead of everyone else.''</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>When we watched the videos later, one person stood out.</p>
<p>``Whoa, who's that?'' said Pam Runge of Milwaukee. ``Look at that; it looks like a demo video. All that jogging paid off.''</p>
<p>It was my friend Becky, the only person in the group using bamboo poles, three-pin boots and ancient skis that hadn't had a glide-wax base in years. Yes, she's a runner � but also a good example that equipment doesn't make the skier.</p>
<p>Phobias about waxing and proper ski gear have driven many people to snowshoeing, Lotto says. But, while sophisticated techniques and equipment do make skiing easier, she says, they're not crucial for beginners.</p>
<p>``The big thing is to get outdoors and find a spot you enjoy,'' she says. ``Then, start out shuffling, and as you begin feeling more comfortable, you can start lengthening your glide. That's where it gets fun.''</p>
<p>But skating � the faster, more graceful but more demanding technique used by racers � is a different matter entirely. Becky and I had tried it, with dismal results.</p>
<p>``I tried that once and almost died,'' Becky said. ``I didn't see how people could do that for very long.''</p>
<p>Along with the other women, we were ready to try it again. First, we skied without poles, which made our ankles ache. Then we skied with poles, but became hopelessly confused by the different styles used for climbing, sprinting or flat land � V-1, in which both poles and one ski are planted at the same time; V-2, with double-poling on each stride; and V-2 alternate, with poling between glides.</p>
<p>It was a lot like ballroom dancing. Just as we caught a rhythm, we'd run into the back of someone's skis and lose it again. And we couldn't fathom how anyone could bound up a hill skating � we had to work harder just to get up the indiscernible uphill grade on Trees for Tomorrow's oval.</p>
<p>``It's hard work, honestly,'' Lotto said. ``The beauty of cross-country skiing is there's always something to work on.''</p>
<p>But when we saw ourselves on video, we were amazed � none of us looked as clumsy as we felt.</p>
<p>There are many ways to learn the basics; in St. Paul, Como Ski Center offers lessons in classical and skating ski techniques on Saturday mornings and Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.</p>
<p>This year, Trees for Tomorrow isn't offering a ski clinic. But Sandy Lotto is, at ABR in Ironwood on Michigan's Upper Peninsula; Nicolet College in Rhinelander; and her own Adventurer's Hostel in Eagle River, which nearly always can be counted on for good snow.</p>
<p>The fun way to practice skiing, of course, is to take a weekend and go off into the woods, to a resort that offers instruction as well as rentals. Here are a few of the best:</p>
<p><em>Bear Paw Inn</em>: This outdoor-adventure resort in northeast Wisconsin is a good place for all winter sports � snowshoeing and mushing, as well as skiing on 15 kilometers of trails. Guided skis will be held Jan. 1, 14 and 28 and Feb. 25, $25 including skis. Lodging only ranges from $22 for a rustic cabin to $104 for a cabin with fireplace and kitchen. Weekend programs include meals. (715) 882-3502, www.bearpawinn.com</p>
<p><em>Maplelag</em>: This friendly resort in northwest Minnesota has fostered skiers of all ages, on 53 kilometers of superb trails at all levels of difficulty. The lodge burned a year ago, but a new one is under construction, and the resort plans to reopen this winter.
