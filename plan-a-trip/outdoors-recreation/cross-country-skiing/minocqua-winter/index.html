<h2>In northeast Wisconsin, snowy forests delight skiers and snowmobilers.</h2>

<p>In northeast Wisconsin, winter can be almost shamelessly beautiful.</p>
<p>Not only is the snow plentiful, it's that photogenic, see-me-sparkle
kind of snow that looks so good draped on pine boughs.</p>
<p>Skiing the Escanaba Lake Trail near Minocqua one February, exchanging
hellos with passing skiers, all of them smiling, I had the feeling I
must be in a magazine shoot.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't get any better than this,&quot; said Joan Barnett of Golden
Valley. &quot;Except if there were a mountain peak.&quot;</p>
<p>It's true there are no snowcapped alps in the distance, but there are
scenic views around nearly every corner, thanks to the nation's densest
concentration of lakes.</p>
<p>In fact, this corner of Wisconsin boasts of little but scenery. After
loggers clear-cut the forest at the turn of the century, the rocky,
untillable land reverted to wilderness-the 220,00 acres of Northern
Highland-American Legion State Forest and, to the east, the 657,000
square acres of Nicolet National Forest.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In summer, the population of the Minocqua area increases tenfold,
swollen by vacationers from Chicago and points south. But in the winter,
this town of only 4,860 returns to serenity, visited only by those who
love it most.</p>
<p>When I was skiing Escanaba, that included Dan Walker of Madison, who was
on his way to visit the isolated spot where he had spread the ashes of
his wife, Nancy, eight months before.</p>
<p>He carried camera equipment in a rucksack; he was photographing the site
in every season, he said, for a display in his home.</p>
<p>They would have celebrated their 27th anniversary that week.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what it is about this area,&quot; Walker said. &quot;It's very
peaceful; it did something for both of us. I'm very honored because she
chose to be here. We were very much in love here.&quot;</p>
<p>The thickly wooded Escanaba Lake system, north of Minocqua, is just a
small part of the hundreds of miles of ski trails in the area. From
there, I headed for the Madeline Lake trails, first stopping to watch a
hot-air balloon launch on Minocqua Lake.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minocqua_torpy_park.jpg" alt="Children in Minocqua's Torpy Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Minocqua sometimes is called the island city because it is nearly
surrounded by the lake, which pulls back only enough to let Highway 51,
which uses a bridge at the southern edge of downtown, continue on to
Woodruff.</p>
<p>The Madeline Lake trail is only two miles east of town, a popular
destination for families, and one boy called to invite me to warm up by
a bonfire.</p>
<p>But Madeline is easier than the rolling Escanaba, and I wasn't ready to
stop on my loop through birch and aspen forest, connected to the parking
lot through meadows and a red-pine plantation.</p>
<p>In the evening, I drove to the Raven Trail, just five miles east of
town, where the DNR was holding a candlelight ski. It was bitterly cold,
but Orion was winking right overhead, and 620 candles glimmered along
the trail.</p>
<p>Some of them had melted their plastic holders into puddles, creating
gaps of inky darkness, but I skied forward on faith until I reached the
bonfire.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There, people were drinking cider, roasting salami and singing &quot;Happy
Birthday&quot; to Pat Voellinger, who had turned 40 that day.</p>
<p>Voellinger, a songwriter, had moved to Minocqua from northern Illinois
seven years before with her husband, Joe, and two young sons. On the way
back, she and I skied together for a while.</p>
<p>&quot;Shortly after we moved, I got skis, and I've been skiing ever since,&quot;
she said. &quot;It's cool. Once, this old guy went whizzing by, and I
thought, 'That's what it's like if you've skied your whole life.'</p>
<p>&quot;And I said, 'Joe, that how our kids are going to be in 40 years.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minocqua_ski_lesson.jpg" alt="Ski lessons at Winter Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Children get on skis for the first time at Winter Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The next day, I drove to Minocqua Winter Park, a cross-country ski area
that has a chalet, ski shop, instructors and 75 kilometers of
well-groomed trails on 6,500 acres deep in the woods west of town.</p>
<p>The park is one of the region's premier training spots for racers and
other serious skiers, but because its lanes are wide, to accommodate
skaters, it lacks the intimacy and serenity of the state-forest trails.</p>
<p>It also tends to trap skiers in its thicket of short trails with various
names, a fact I should have remembered, having had the same problem the
last time I skied there.</p>
<p>After skiing with friends to the start of the 11-kilometer River Run,
which reaches into a long elbow of the Squirrel River, I decided to cut
over to the Yukon Trail, which I'd heard was especially scenic. This,
however, was a mistake.</p>
<p>Best plan: Get there early, and just ski until you don't want to ski
any more. Then use the map to return to the chalet.</p>
<p>Wherever you go in Minocqua, you'll be surrounded by snow and serenity.</p>

<p>&quot;I really look forward to the winter,&quot; said former inn proprietor
Anita White, one of many residents who first got hooked on the area
through years of vacationing there. &quot;Then we get our lake back. In the
summers, it gets kind of crazy.&quot;</p>
