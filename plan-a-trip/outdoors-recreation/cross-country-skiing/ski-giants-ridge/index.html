<h2>For novice nordic skiers, this Iron Range resort rolls out the red carpet.</h2>

<p>For cross-country skiers, Giants Ridge has it all: Plentiful snow.
Scenery. Sixty kilometers of groomed trails.</p>
<p>Best of all, it has chairlifts.</p>
<p>Alpine skiers aren't the only ones who think downhills are more fun than
uphills. Nordic skiers also like to put gravity on their side,
especially those who are trying to learn how to skate.</p>
<p>Skating is the faster but more demanding technique used by racers and
other serious skiers. Not only is it  faster and more fun, but it
doesn't require groomed tracks. So skiers need less snow; even a few
inches on a lake will do.</p>
<p>There was just one problem: Skating is hard.</p>
<p>Unlike striding, it requires continual forward propulsion. You can't
herringbone up hills, stopping to rest if need be; you have to shoot up
the hills in one fluid motion. It takes a lot of technique-technique
that's hard to learn if you're exhausted after the first hill.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>That's where the chairlifts come in.</p>
<p>Unlike other alpine ski resorts, Giants Ridge is just as well-known for
nordic skiing. It was an Olympic training center when the state opened
the ski area in 1984 as a way to generate jobs on the Iron Range.</p>
<p>It's still a favorite training spot for skiers of all ages and hosts the
annual state high-school tournament and many other races, including the
Mesabi East Invitational, North America's largest high-school ski
event.</p>
<p>It's taken a while, but alpine skiers from the Twin Cities have
discovered Giants Ridge. It's only a 3¼-hour drive, its grooming is
superb, its snow conditions are reliably good and it has a very nice
chalet and an all-suites lodge at the foot of the hill.</p>
<p>So if you like both alpine skiing and nordic skiing, you're in luck.</p>
<p>The first time I went there, I skied both alpine and classic, and when I
used the chairlift to get to the top of the Bronze nordic trail, I
realized its gradual downhill would be an ideal place to practice
skating.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/i/giants_ridge_scott_jodi.jpg" alt="Cross-country skiers." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>I'd tried it before, and even the slightest incline instantly sapped my
strength.</p>
<p>The next time, I brought my new skate skis and settled into the homey
Villas at Giant Ridge. In the morning, I just walked across the road to
the ski hill.</p>
<p>It was good I was fresh and using my classic skis to check things out,
because at the top of the chairlift, I mistakenly headed out on Gold, a
harrowing string of steep climbs and drops.</p>
<p>When I finally found Bronze and start to cruise down, I was surprised to
see the ski team from Southwest High School in Minneapolis, puffing its
way up.</p>
<p>It seemed like a waste of a perfectly good downhill, but each to his
own.</p>
<p>Ron Kutsi of nearby Virginia skis hundreds of kilometers every season at
Giants Ridge, and he's happy to take the lifts.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;There are never too many downhills, as far as I'm concerned,&quot; he
said. &quot;Of course, the purists look at me and sneer, 'Why is he doing
that?' Hey, I've had knee surgery, I take the lift up and enjoy
myself.&quot;</p>
<p>Giants Ridge lies on the eastern edge of an exposed stretch of the
Laurentian Divide that the Ojibwe called the Mesabi, or Sleeping Giant.
To the east lies Sabin and Wynne lakes, where the Embarrass River
widens. To the west lies Superior National Forest.</p>
<p>There are lovely views from the six-kilometer Summit Trail, which
follows the ridge, and that's one of Kutsi's favorites. But the
three-kilometer northern stretch of Gold is his &quot;reward trail.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's how I finish up the day and put a smile on my face,&quot; he
says.</p>
<p>For skating, that was my favorite, too, and I skied it over and over. It
was an easy hop from the chairlift onto the rolling trail, where new
snow had frosted the spruce tops and made the nubs of branches as fuzzy
as baby antlers.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/i/giants_ridge_skier2.jpg" alt="A skier at Giants Ridge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A straightaway beside a marsh was the best part. There, I could &quot;think
like Dorothy,&quot; almost clicking my heels behind me in a long glide,
or, as Ron Kutsi advises, &quot;pretend you have dust mitts on your feet and
you're polishing the floor.&quot;</p>
<p>The Gold trail flows into the cross-country &quot;stadium&quot; at the foot of
the lodge, another good place to practice, and there I ran into three
friendly sophomores from Southwest High.</p>
<p>They'd picked up the skating technique quickly, as young folk tend to
do, making the rest of us envious.</p>
<p>&quot;My dad said he was going to rent skate skis and try it, and I was
like, 'Oh-oh,' &quot; said Maddy Shaw of Minneapolis. &quot;He was getting
really frustrated. I don't have the experience to teach him, but he
tried hard, and he slept a lot afterward.&quot;</p>
<p>The trio took time to give me advice: Keep your feet under you and your
weight centered over your feet. Push off with your heel. Use your
stomach muscles. Remember to glide.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;You have to keep in mind all the little things you have to do, the
little checklist,&quot; Shaw said.</p>
<p>Her friend Rosie Frankowski, who went on to ski for the United States in
the 2018 Winter Olympics, said she often skis the black-diamond runs at
Lutsen with her family, but finds nordic skiing more rewarding.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, you say, 'I just went up and down eight kilometers of hills,'
&quot; she said, &quot;and there, it's 'Yeah, I went down a hill . . . with
gravity.' &quot;</p>
<p>But since the alpine hills looked so inviting, I skied them, too,
enjoying the sweeping panorama of lakes and forest.</p>
<p>For skiers, Giants Ridge seems like the best of both worlds. Or even
three worlds-as I looked up the hill, I saw a man coming down on
telemark skis, using a style so graceful it looked like dancing.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of skiing you're doing, it's nice to have gravity
on your side. After that, everything else is gravy.</p>
