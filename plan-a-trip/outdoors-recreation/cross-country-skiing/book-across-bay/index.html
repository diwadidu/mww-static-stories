<h2>In winter, ski across Chequamegon Bay by candlelight and see the ice caves, too.</h2>

<p>In summer, the Bayfield Peninsula, on the northern tip of Wisconsin, is
a playground of sand, water and woods, beloved by tourists.</p>
<p>In winter, the playground expands.</p>
<p>Lake Superior freezes and people come to play, walking to the mainland
ice caves near Cornucopia and skiing across Chequamegon Bay by
candlelight.</p>
<p>The window of opportunity can be narrow. The ice caves usually can be reached
for only a few days, or not at all. The Book Across the
Bay race, which has grown from 350 skiers to 3,500, is held only on one
day.</p>
<p>Get lucky, and you can do both.</p>
<p>One year, I was lucky. I got to explore the caves and ski on the bay
<em>and</em> in the forest. I found a swell place
to stay, to have coffee and to eat, all in Washburn, a workaday town
that generally plays second fiddle to <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/bayfield-winter/">Bayfield</a>.</p>
<p>It was in the first-rate Good Thyme bistro that we heard that
Apostle Islands National Lakeshore rangers were allowing visits to the
ice caves.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It was mid-February, on the early side. If shoreline ice becomes
thick enough to support people, it's usually not until late February or early March.</p>
<p>The next morning, we drove toward Cornucopia and joined a stream of
people traipsing the mile to the caves, alongside a mountain range of
ice pushed toward the shore by the wind.</p>
<p>Every year, wind, water and snow sculpt new patterns on the shore and on
the cliffs, draped in ice that seeps through the red and pink sandstone
layers and emerges in fantastical formations, like the stalactites and
flowstone of underground caves.</p>
<p>Even daily, the scene changes. By midafternoon on the day we were there,
the sun's warmth had turned snow into foam and made icicles a milky
white, like meringue.</p>
<p>On the cliffs, bulging ice falls gleam a pale blue or green. Inside the
caves, soda-straw icicles carpet the ceilings — &quot;chin bristles,&quot;
my husband dubbed them — and bacon-strip ice covers walls.</p>
<p>&quot;It's incredible. I can't believe my eyes,&quot; I heard a woman say from
inside one of the caves.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/s/ashland_book_costume.jpg" alt="Book Across the Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Many Book Across the Bay skiers wear goofy costumes.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The people-watching was nearly as good. There was a Boy Scout troop from
De Kalb, Ill., and a winter-camping class from St. Scholastica in
Duluth, lugging gear on plastic sleds.</p>
<p>People were setting up Coleman stoves and having picnics on the ice. In
late afternoon, the photographers come out, trying to catch the warm
rays of sunset on the red sandstone or a moonrise over the cliff-top
cedars.</p>
<p>But we had to get ready for the race.</p>
<h3>Cars on ice</h3>
<p>As we drove back through Bayfield, we saw cars driving to Madeline
Island on the ice road, lined with discarded Christmas trees.</p>
<p>In Washburn, school buses were waiting to take us to the starting line
in Ashland. (Now, the route begins and ends in Ashland.)</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The 10-kilometer Book Across the Bay started as a community event in
1997, something fun to do in the depths of winter that also would raise
money for the Washburn Public Library and Tri-County Medical Society.</p>
<p>It's still a homespun event, more tour than race, though some skiers
use it as a warm-up to the American Birkebeiner.</p>
<p>At the starting line, there were skiers of all ages. Skiers from
Madnorski, a ski club in Madison, had shown up in feather boas and
tutus, and members of a 4-H club were dressed as the Jolly Green Giant
and a bunny.</p>
<p>We started in a pack, with the skate-skiers whizzing ahead on the left.
By the second kilometer, I had a track to myself, the stars were out and
I skied into the darkness, following ice lanterns and ticking off the
kilometers, each one marked by a bonfire and water stop.</p>
<p>As the path bent toward Washburn, I saw fireworks exploding over the
town and picked up my pace, gliding over the finish line just ahead of a
12-year-old girl from Ashland. A volunteer said, &quot;Thanks for skiing
with us today.&quot;</p>
<p>My husband was waiting, giddy after his first race.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mawikwe_blue_ice.jpg" alt="Blue icefall at ice caves." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the mainland shoreline near Cornucopia, a giant icefall is tinted
blue and pink.

<p>&quot;Another bonfire would come rolling around, and I'd think, 'It's so
cool to be skiing by firelight,' &quot; he said. &quot;That was fun, fun, fun,
fun.&quot;</p>
<p>It's pretty much the most fun you can have in winter for $30. We went
into the heated tent for chili, hot dogs and cocoa and to listen to a
blues band. Then, we went back outside to watch the giant bonfire,
ringed by trees strung with twinkle lights.</p>
<h3>Not a tourist town</h3>
<p>Unlike Bayfield, which attracted tourists from the start, Washburn was
all business, named in 1883 by a railroad company for a recently
deceased stockholder, Cadwallader Washburn.</p>
<p>Washburn bustled during World War I, thanks to a DuPont dynamite
factory, but it has settled into a more sedate existence as district
headquarters for Chequamegon National Forest.</p>
<p>Its milling, shipping and quarrying days still are reflected in its
sturdy buildings of Lake Superior brownstone.</p>
<p>Today, Washburn is a tightly knit town of year-round residents,
including artists and others who make a living from the tourist trade in
Bayfield but can't afford to live there.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>One of the 19th-century brownstones up the street is home to Chequamegon
Book &amp; Coffee Co., started by former Madison residents Richard and Carol
Avol.</p>
<p>It has an unusually interesting collection of new, used and rare books,
plus gifts and discounted CDs and reading tables next to tall corner
windows.</p>
<p>After having coffee and buying some books, we drove through the wooded
peninsula up to Mount Valhalla, where the forest service maintains a
network of ski trails.</p>
<p>Lots of people were out skiing, and we joined them on the Teuton loops A
and B, both of which started in gradual uphills and finished with nice,
long downhills — energy-wise, a lot of bang for the buck.</p>
<p>The peninsula also has downhill skiing, as well as another 35 kilometers
of cross-country skiing, at Mount Ashwabay.</p>
<p>There's no shortage of things to do in Washburn. When snow falls and
ice freezes, it's time to come out and play.</p>
