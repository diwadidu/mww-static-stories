Skiers glide by the Six Swedes cabin at Maplelag.

<p>It was an early January day in western Minnesota. A biting wind was
blowing off the prairie, and the mercury was sinking faster than the
Titanic.</p>
<p>But it didn't matter. I was at Maplelag, where the world is my iceberg .
. . um, oyster.</p>
<p>At Maplelag, no matter how inhospitable the outside world is, the
lodge's stained-glass windows turn the wan rays of winter into gleaming
golds and apricots. The steam billowing from the giant hot tub creates a
dome of warmth amid the tundra. Bottomless cookie jars and baskets of
hot fry bread keep guests fat and happy.</p>
<p>And the skiing, on 64 kilometers of perfectly groomed trails, always is
superb.</p>
<p>Rising slightly at a point where prairie meets the eastern hardwood
forest and northern pine forest, Maplelag's trees catch the first snow
from the west.</p>
<p>Once under a canopy of maples, it comes under the custody of Jay
Richards, who combs, cossets and grooms it as if it were the pelt of a
prize poodle.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to take care of it and baby it,&quot; says Richards, an avid
skier and the son of Maplelag founders Jim and Mary Richards. &quot;I have a
lot of little tricks.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The skiing at Maplelag only partly explains the extreme devotion of its
guests, who have voted it No. 1 family resort in North America and No.
1 overall resort in the Midwest in Cross Country Skier magazine.</p>
<p>I've been going to this resort north of Detroit Lakes for years, always
on weekends. There's a lot of hustle and bustle then, with 200 guests
beating paths between trails, coffee pot, saunas, hot tub and cabins,
then gathering for meals and the Saturday-night talent show and dance.</p>
<p>But one year I switched tempo and came during the week for a learning
vacation, bringing an Alabama-bred friend, a recent Minnesota transplant
who barely had seen snow, much less skied in it.</p>
<p>He would learn to ski classically, and I would learn to skate, the
faster but more strenuous technique using shorter skis.</p>
<p>We were greeted enthusiastically by Jim and Mary Richards, the
personable couple who moved to this wooded bowl on the edge of the
eastern hardwood forest in 1973, made maple syrup for 12 years and then
devoted themselves to running a one-of-a-kind ski resort.</p>

<p>It was 6 degrees below zero, with a wind chill of 40 below, but we
didn't even consider postponing the first lesson.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a little windy today, but it's nice out in the woods, just like a
dream,&quot; said a deadpan Jim Richards. &quot;It's a day at the beach.&quot;</p>
<p>A day at a beach in Antarctica, maybe. But I'd told my friend Nathaniel
all about polypropylene underwear, and explained the concepts of wicking
and layering, so he was ready.</p>
<p>Jay Richards took us out to the Poki Loki trail and showed Nathaniel how
to stride, herringbone up a hill and use his poles to propel himself
along. But using a wedge to go downhill gave him some trouble.</p>
<p>&quot;If you fall down, that means you're trying,&quot; Jay said diplomatically,
after praising his poling technique.</p>
<p>The woods were brilliantly lit by the afternoon sun. When we came over a
small hill on Mother North Star, I noticed an unusual peach-and-yellow
glow through the trees, like a skinnier, two-toned sun.</p>
<p>But the real sun was to the left, and another peach glow was to the left
of the sun.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Those are sun dogs,&quot; Jay told us. &quot;They're ice crystals that refract
the light, for a rainbow effect. They're indicative of the cold.&quot;</p>
<p>We knew all about the cold. Nathaniel's glasses had iced over, virtually
blinding him. But back at the lodge, he delivered his verdict on
cross-country skiing.</p>
<p>&quot;That was great,&quot; he said, grinning. &quot;I had a good time. And now I
can tell my grandkids someday that I learned to ski when it was 40
below.&quot;</p>
<p>For dinner, there were platters of roast chicken, scalloped corn, salad,
fry bread and cream puffs drizzled with chocolate.</p>
<p>We sat next to Paul and Helen Bowlin of Golden Valley, who had come with
their two sons, their sons' wives and their grandkids, four cheerful
tykes between the ages of 1 and 6.</p>
<p>The family, said Paul Bowlin, had been coming to Maplelag for a decade,
usually after the holidays.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/maplelag_lodge.jpg" alt="The lodge at Maplelag Resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The roomy lodge includes a sunny dining room, reading loft, ping-pong
tables, massage rooms and sauna, steam room and large indoor-outdoor
whirlpool.

<p>&quot;We'd come when they were home from college, and they had to work out a
lot of stress,&quot; he said. &quot;They'd come up here and ski their legs off.
Then they'd come with girlfriends, and then with fiancees, who had to
pass the hole-in-the-ice test.</p>
<p>&quot;Now they've got kids, and we don't want them to lose the tradition of
a northern winter, even the ones in Tulsa. We're brainwashing them into
thinking they're still Minnesotan.&quot;</p>
<p>I told Nathaniel about the fabled hole in Sugarbush Lake. If guests jump
into it after baking themselves in the outdoors sauna, they can buy a
T-shirt reading &quot;I Took the Plunge.&quot;</p>
<p>Fortunately for Nathaniel, I've never wanted to jump in the lake myself,
so I didn't expect him to. We took the heat instead, him in the steam
sauna and me in the hot tub, which the Richardses say is the largest in
Minnesota.</p>
<p>The next morning it was 15 below but windless, and after a breakfast of
French toast and sausage, Nathaniel said he wanted to try some more
hills. So we headed out for the rolling Bullhead Lake trail via Suicide
Hill, down which Nathaniel tumbled, laughing merrily.</p>
<p>He fell down a long decline on the lake, too, but when I suggested he
try again, sailed down with style.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Beyond the cattail marsh, we ran into Paul Bowlin, on the lookout for
great gray owls, but the wildlife had relinquished the woods to mad dogs
and Minnesotans.</p>
<p>By the time we got back, Nathaniel's eyelashes were fringed with ice,
and I took a photo for him to send to his parents in Texas. Then we
played two cutthroat games of ping-pong, read magazines in a sunny
corner of the dining room and had lunch.</p>
<p>Then it was time for my lesson. Jay Richards gave me shorter skis and
longer poles, took me out to the Skaters Waltz trail and tried to convey
whatever magic it is that allows skaters to dance so gracefully over the
untracked snow.</p>
<p>He exhorted me to align with my ski-toe-knee-nose-and to walk
like a cowboy, pushing off into a wide glide. When I drew back, he said,
I should &quot;think like Dorothy,&quot; with my heels almost clicking.</p>
<p>I didn't dance, and I wasn't graceful. But I did get a few glimmers of
how much fun it would be if I ever did get the hang of it.</p>
<p>Then we had to leave. And as we pulled away, I found that, even if I
could barely skate, I was at least thinking like Dorothy: In winter,
there's no place like Maplelag.</p>
