<p>A collection of classic classic trails</p>
<p>Phil Van Valkenberg | 01/26/2009 3:10PM | 4 Comments</p>
<p>Classic skiing is regaining respect. It never really lost it with most recreational skiers who are most happy to just shuffle through the snow. There was a time, though, when classic was disrespected by some high-performance skiers. I recall a day 15 years ago on the Baker trails in the Twin Cities when I strode up to find a young skater actually relieving himself in the groomed track. I made some terse comment, but the look on his face was one of surprise. I could almost hear him asking, �Doesn�t everybody pee in the track?�</p>
<p>Trails don�t have to be tracked to be enjoyed by classic skiers. At the same time, there�s no question that machine tracking made cross-country skiing more popular worldwide. Those of us ancients who got into the sport before set tracks remember dealing with a myriad of natural conditions. Still, as a classic skier, when you show up at a trail and it hasn�t been tracked, you can still ski in tracks of your own. Skaters will usually just turn around and go home.</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>What makes a classic classic trail? In these cases, the answer is simple. They�re among my favorites. As a certified oldie, my roots are deep in the classic skiing experience � reaching as far back as the wood ski and pre-grooming days. The collection of trails below have personal significance and, as with a favorite beer, bring back wonderful memories of perfect wax, wildlife, skiing with friends or just that perfect kick and glide combination (the trails, not the beer). Some of these trails I�ve skied many times and others only once. All are worth sharing.</p>
<p>Take a look at my trail picks. If you�ve skied them you probably have memories of your own. If not, check them out. You can find locator and trail maps at skinnyski.com and get real skier experience reports on conditions. Park or trail passes are required at each of these locations. If you have skied them or have classic trail favorites to recommend, I invite you to leave your comments here.</p>
<p>Korkki Nordic Trail</p>
<p>Duluth, Minn.</p>
<p>I�ve only skied Korkki once. People told me for years I had to stride there to see what cross-country used to be like. I was glad I wasn�t a bigger guy with broader shoulders. The trail is that narrow. It gives you an incredible illusion of speed to have trees and brush rushing by so close. I�ve been told the annual Erik Judeen Classic, set for February 15 this winter, is a sight to see. Some 50 skiers charge about 100 yards for position on the one set of classic tracks.</p>
<p>According to Birkie Founder John Kotar, who started skiing Korkki in 1972, the trails were laid out by the late Nordic skiing legend Charlie Banks on his land near Duluth. �You ski the natural terrain there with all the thrills and technique requirements entailed,� Kotar said. �It�s all doable and totally intimate. One of the beauties is it�s exactly 10K and we could easily gauge our performance there.�</p>
<p>The outer loop is for experts, but there are 4K and 6K intermediate-ability cutoffs, and the wood stove in the cabin Charlie built is waiting at the trailhead.</p>
<p>Valkyrie Ski Trail</p>
<p>Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, Washburn, Wis.</p>
<p>Part of the Mount Valhalla Winter Sports Area, the Valkyrie is a great singletrack classic-only trail in the hilly Bayfield Peninsula. The Valhalla area has roots in the Nordic past when a ski jump sttod there. Clear-cut logging in the �50s exposed the jump to the wind and eventually it was blown down. Left over was a warming lodge with a stone fireplace to welcome cross-country skiers and snowmobilers to the resurging forest during the �70s.</p>
<p>The area spans County C with the Valkyrie Trail on the north side and the Teuton Trail, which is groomed for classic and skating, on the south side where the lodge is. Valkyrie has three loops, the longest being 9.5K. According to David Paulson, who laid out the trails in the mid �60s, the trail is built to 85 percent International Ski Federation (FIS) standards, which means its nearly the right mix of flats, climbs and descents allowable for elite competition. In any case, the trails makes for a wonderful and doable challenge.</p>
<p>Despite the trail name, you need not be Tom Cruise with an an eye patch to ski here. But you will find one imnpressive sun bowl. Sun bowls are dry kettle depressions in the moraine that have freezing night temperatures 10 months out of the year and are barren of trees. There are many sun bowls in the forest here, but there is one the size of five football fields.</p>
<p>After the last loop cutoff about 2K out, you are committed to skiing the entire loop, so bring a snack and water. A warm fire will be waiting when you return to the lodge.</p>
<p>Raven Trail</p>
<p>Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest, Woodruff, Wis.</p>
<p>There are many ski trails in the Minocqua-Woodruff area of northern Wisconsin, including the excellent system at Minocqua Winter Park. In the nearby state forest is the Raven Trail, a long-time favorite of mine although I can�t say for sure that it�s still groomed for classic only.</p>
<p>ADS:16</p>
<p>It�s an old system with four loops from 2K to 8K enclosed by several lakes. A big attraction is the Adirondack shelter which faces south to catch the low winter sun. An elevated fire pit that looks like a stone cairn and a stash of firewood add more warmth at this wonderful mid-trail spot. Part of the long expert Red Trail are closed this winter due to logging, but you can still access the shelter. The rest of the loops are for skiers with intermediate ability.</p>
<p>Norm Oakvik Trail</p>
<p>Theodore Wirth Park, Minneapolis, Minn.</p>
<p>One of the best short striding trails in America is named for Minnesota Nordic skiing great Norm Oakvik, a champion ski jumper and Nordic skier. Long known as the Eloise Butler Trail, for the flower gardens along Theodore Wirth Parkway it wound through, the trail was laid out by Oakvik and for years was the site of USSA races. The 3.5K trail got great reviews from national and international skiers, including Norwegian legend and Birkie winner Oddvar Bra. In recent years about a third of the trail has been widened and incorporated into the City of Lakes Loppet route.</p>
<p>To visit the Oakvik Trail is to get a glimpse of cross-country�s singletrack past. You have the added option of skiing Wirth Park�s extensive trail system, some of the best of what Minneapolis has to offer.</p>
<p>Flandrau State Park</p>
<p>New Ulm, Minn.</p>
<p>I can�t say I remember a lot about the skiing on the myriad of trails that loop through the bottom lands of the Cottonwood River and up and down the 100-foot-high bluffs other than it was fun classic skiing.</p>
<p>I do, however, have great memories of the August Schell Brewery, which can be accessed from the east end of the trail system, and their annual Bock Fest which includes the Great Bock Hunt. Participants in the Bock Hunt prowl the park on foot or skis searching for hidden �bocks� -- goat head silhouettes -- for cash prizes or more beer. Skiing gives you no advantage in the hunt. In fact it may be a handicap since it�s hard to ski while gripping a beer stein. Polka bands liven up Bock Fest, which happens during the town�s Fasching celebration, a German version of Mardi Gras, the same weekend as the Birkie this year. The brewery is open for tours on other weekends and of course the 12K of trails are fun anytime there�s snow.</p>
<p>Blue Mound State Park</p>
<p>Blue Mounds, Wis.</p>
<p>It�s the highest point in southern Wisconsin and a high point for skiers thanks to great grooming and snow catching elevation. The trails are groomed for classic and skating, though more popular among those who do the former. There are five trails, including a couple of short, easy loops. An outer circuit totals about 10K.</p>
<p>Blue Mound is a singular cone-shape hill so skiing there involves long climbs and downhill runs. Some beautiful overviews of the surrounding countryside add to the �top of the world� feeling. The park has come a long way since the boom days in the early �70s when skiers were directed down hiking trails too narrow to herringbone or snowplow. Skier here often recalled hard falls and splintered skis.</p>
<p>Three miles east of the park the Grumpy Troll brewpub in the pleasant town of Mount Horeb is a good spot to share post-ski stories these days.</p>
<p>Scuppernong Trails</p>
<p>Southern Kettle Moraine State Forest, Eagle, Wis.</p>
<p>One of the original groomed trails in the southern part of the state, the Scup is hard to find and pronounce, but great to ski in good conditions. I don�t know of any other exclusively classic doubletrack trails. Three loops, from 4K to 8K, have a wonderful flow that mixes old forest road sections with twisting, often steep and challenging, moraine terrain through a thick mixed pine and hardwood forest; good shelter on very cold days. Rolling esker-top segments are highlights as is the Observation Loop, a great spot to catch the sunset or an overview of the surrounding flatland.</p>
<p>While grooming is always first rate, these trails probably are not the best choice for less than expert skiers they�re icy.</p>
<p>There are three other well-groomed trails systems nearby in the state forest which include easier loops and skating. The Scup is a quarter mile east of State Highway 67 on County Trunk ZZ. It�s worth hunting for.</p>
<p>Cam-Rock Ski Trails</p>
<p>Cam-Rock County Park, Cambridge, Wis</p>
<p>Here�s a trail system that�s really personal as it�s in my hometown and I�ve skied there for 50 winters.</p>
<p>Before it became a Dane County park with planned trails, my neighbor and I would stride on Koshkonong Creek three miles south to Rockdale (hence the eventual park name, Cam-Rock) which had the only hill of any significance. Today you can get on the trail at the north end in Cambridge following an old railroad grade for the first mile (Cam-Rock Area 1) where a new bridge across the creek lets you access Area 3 and a 2K loop over the 150-foot hill. Out and back you�ll cover 8K and there are also 3K of rolling trail at Area 2 on the other side of the creek.</p>
<p>The trails are nominally groomed for skating as well, but mostly that�s done in Area 2. Grooming is spotty and people often walk in the track from the Cambridge end.</p>
<p>For me it�s a �must ski� trail when there�s snow. And there�s often snow there when nearby Madison is bare. Besides, Cambridge is a nice place to visit (even when I�m not there) with its cute bakery. In Rockdale there�s Heather�s Bar, a local classic of another sort.</p>
<p>Many other great classic skiing experiences come to mind, like the Smreaker Trails in the Black River State Forest; Allison�s and Rock Lake trails near Cable, Wisconsin; Anvil Lake Trail near Eagle River, Wisconsin; Wood Lake Nature Center in Richfield, Minnesota; Ox Cart Trail at Bearskin Lodge on the Gunflint Trail in Minnesota. Friends are also telling me I�ve got to ski the Pike Creek Trail off of the Mount Ashwabay system near Bayfield, Wisconsin.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy my picks as well as other classic trails. Just remember, if there�s yellow snow in the track, these days you�ve probably only got an errant animal or another classic skier to blame.</p>

<p>Great list, Phil, but I will note that Blue Mound is only groomed for skating when there isn't enough snow to set a track Otherwise, groomer Karl Heil sets a single &quot;best-line&quot; clic track Well worth a visit</p>

<p>Nice job! Memory Lane and all. Good selection of trails. Cross-country skiing has come a very long way in the last two decades. It's an infinite loop. As equipment gets better, the ski experience improves, the grooming gets better, more people ski, equipment improves. So many trails, so little time. Rats!</p>

<p>Nice selection Phil, and of course, the list goes on. I wouldn't want to miss the Rock Lake trails on the Chequamegon-Nicolet NF, especially after several inches of new snow. Very hilly, but very skiable. Expertly designed by Dave Nelson.</p>
