<h2>On snow-laden trails, cross-country skiers glide on cloud nine.</h2>

<p>On Minnesota's North Shore, it's a happy day when snow is as abundant
as scenery.</p>
<p>Despite its miles of cross-country ski trails, the western shore of Lake
Superior gets only modest amounts of lake-effect snow, because the
storms that blow in from the east tend to dump it inland, where the land
mass is colder.</p>
<p>So if you want to ski, the trick is to head for the hills, ignoring the
thinner snow along the highway.</p>
<p>That's what we did one February, driving up from Duluth. A freezing
drizzle had made Minnesota 61 slick, and wind buffeted our car. We
almost turned back, but we really wanted to ski.</p>
<p>In Beaver Bay, we turned up County Road 4. And just 3 miles up from the
lake, as the crow flies, we entered a different world.</p>
<p>Fluffy new snow covered the fir trees that hug the narrow,
classical-only lanes of Northwoods Ski Trails, groomed by the Northwoods
Ski Club.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It was the first good snow of the season for us, and we were on cloud
nine as we glided along the Beaver River toward Tettegouche State Park.
The trail hadn't been groomed for a while, but a couple of previous
skiers had set a decent track.</p>
<p>Wooded cliffs loomed over the west side of the river, lining Palisade
Valley. There's a connector trail through the valley to Tettegouche
State Park, and skiing there feels a little like being in a national
park out west.</p>
<p>It wasn't groomed, nor was the trail to Bean Lake, a favorite spot on
the Superior Hiking Trail. But we were happy to ski the rest of the
trails.</p>
<p>And after we crossed the snowmobile trail, we found ourselves on fresh
corduroy — the groomer had gone through!</p>
<p>From there, it was an exhilarating glide to our car on perfectly groomed
trail. We could hardly bear to leave, but the day was waning.</p>
<p>Another year, we were staying in Little Marais when we saw a few flakes
turn into real snow. There hadn't been much, so it seemed like manna
from heaven.</p>

<p>We grabbed our skis and headed up the Sawbill Trail from Tofte to the
Britton Peak trailhead, from which the Sugarbush Trail Association
carefully maintains 65 kilometers of trails.</p>
<p>We glided along, marveling at the beauty of the new snow, draped so
picturesquely on bough and bush.</p>
<p>But under the new fluff lay the old lumps and ice. So after skiing the
Piece of Cake loop, we drove farther up the Sawbill Trail to the Moose
Fence trailhead.</p>
<p>The Maple Loop was in much better shape, and we were able to turn our
attention to the lovely tableaux in the forest and to the trees ahead,
from which clumps of snow occasionally exploded over the trail.</p>
<p>It was gorgeous. Gliding along on snowy lanes crowded by spruce and fir,
we didn't even notice we were working.</p>
<p>So here's the lesson: If you're driving along Lake Superior and it
seems as if you won't be able to ski, you're probably wrong.</p>
<p>Just drive a few miles into the hills, and you're likely to find an
entirely different tableau — that winter wonderland that makes you
glad to be up north.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Skiing Minnesota's North Shore</h3>
<p><em>Trail fee:</em>  A <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/licenses/skipass/index.html">Great Minnesota Ski
Pass</a>, which
costs $10 daily, $25 yearly or $70 for three years, is required for
skiers 16 and older.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's available at Holiday stations in Duluth, Two Harbors and Tofte, at
the Clearview Store in Lutsen and sports shops around the state. It also
can be purchased by mail or online.</p>
<p><em>Trails:</em>  There are 80 kilometers of trails in <em>Duluth,</em>  with more
just outside town, and the parks departments grooms them quickly after a
snowfall.</p>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/skiing-in-duluth/">Cross-country in Duluth</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.skinnyski.com/trails/traildetail.asp?Id=458">Northwoods Ski
Trail</a> near
<em>Silver Bay</em> has 19 kilometers of single-track classical trails through
rolling forest along the Beaver River and around Bean Lake.</p>
<p>There's a 5-kilometer connecting trail to <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/tettegouche/index.html">Tettegouche State
Park</a>
through gorgeous Palisade Valley, though it may not be groomed.</p>
<p>To get to the trailhead, take County Road 4 from Beaver Bay, turning
right onto County Road 5; it's on the left. From Silver Bay, take
County Road 5.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sugarbushtrail.org">Sugarbush Trail</a> system between
<em>Tofte</em> and <em>Lutsen</em> has 65 kilometers of classical and skating trails
that are beautifully groomed by Pisten Bully. On the Saturday of President's Day weekend, it offers a candlelight ski.</p>
<p>Many people like the 3-kilometer Tofte Ski-down, a gradual downhill from
the Britton Peak trailhead to Sawtooth Outfitters/Bluefin Bay; local
resorts, including Bluefin Bay, provide shuttles for
their guests.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/u/sugarbush_trail_skiing.jpg" alt="Skiing the Sugarbush Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's also a 4-kilometer ski-down from the Oberg Mountain loop to the
golf-course loops at Lutsen Resort.</p>
<p>The Homestead Loop, a 12-kilometer intermediate ski from Britton Peak,
has views of the lake. For more challenge, ski the 25 kilometers from
Moose Fence to Minnesota 61.</p>
<p>At the end of County Road 2 (Sawbill Trail), 22½ miles from Tofte on a
mostly gravel road, the 7½ kilometers around <em>Sawbill Lake</em> Campground
may have snow when areas closer to the lake don't. They're groomed for
classic skiing.</p>
<p>The 57 kilometers of all-classical <a href="http://norpinetrails.org/pages/Trailmap.html#">Norpine Ski
Trails</a> system between
<em>Lutsen</em> and <em>Cascade River State Park</em> has trails on both sides of the
Cascade River.</p>
<p>The Norpine Trail Association maintains the trails west of the Cascade
River, up to the Sugarbush Trail system.</p>
<p><a href="http://pincushiontrails.org/">Pincushion Mountain</a>, three miles up the
Gunflint Trail from <em>Grand Marais,</em> has 25 kilometers of trails tracked
and groomed for striding and skating, with a public warming house and a
2-kilometer trail that's lighted most nights.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's skiing in the state parks, but don't expect great grooming.</p>
<p>Skiing farther up the <em>Gunflint Trail</em> is nearly always excellent, even
when conditions are marginal elsewhere in the state.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/north-shore-lodgings/">Winter on Minnesota's Gunflint
Trail</a>.</p>
<p><em>Lighted skiing:</em>  The 10 kilometers of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/2HarborsSkiTrail/">Erkki Harju Ski
Trail</a> in Two Harbors 
includes a very nice, easy three-kilometer loop that's lighted.
Donations help the local ski club maintain it.</p>
<p>From Minnesota 61, turn onto County Road 2; it's less than a mile.</p>
<p><em>Equipment rental:</em>  <a href="http://www.cascadelodgemn.com">Cascade Lodge</a>
between Lutsen and Grand Marais, <a href="http://www.sawtoothoutfitters.com">Sawtooth
Outfitters</a> in Tofte and <a href="https://www.stoneharborws.com/rentals">Stone
Harbor Wilderness
Supply</a>
in Grand Marais rent skis and also snowshoes. Stone Harbor even rents
skijoring kits.</p>
<p><em>Trail shuttle:</em>  Many resorts, including Lutsen Resort and Bluefin Bay,
offer shuttles to trailheads; ask when reserving. Sawtooth Outfitters
also offers a shuttle from its shop.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations:</em>  Reserve early for weekends; remember, cross-country
skiers who want to stay in the Tofte-Lutsen area compete for lodgings
with downhill skiers.</p>

Shore</a>.</p>
