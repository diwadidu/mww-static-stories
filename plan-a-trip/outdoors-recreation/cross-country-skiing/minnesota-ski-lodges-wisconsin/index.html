<p>In a blizzard, nothing is better than holing up with an expert cook, a
bottomless cookie jar, a steam room, a big hot tub and one of the best
ski-trail groomers in the Midwest.</p>
<p>One January, the stars aligned in the heavens and I found myself in the
best possible place to be during a blizzard: Maplelag.</p>
<p>This ski resort in northwest Minnesota is renowned for many things —
all-you-can-eat meals, personable owners, hundreds of stained-glass
windows and signs from defunct train depots — but it's most famous for
its ability to conjure a bit of snow into world-class ski tracks when
the rest of Minnesota is bare.</p>
<p>On this weekend, however, no alchemy was necessary. As my husband and I
drove west, snow began to fly, and by the time we nosed the car into
Maplelag's drive, a foot had fallen.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Another foot was on the way, making trail-grooming wizard Jay Richards
the happiest man in the Great Northwest.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the kind of snow you dream about,&quot; said Richards, an avid
skier and the son of Maplelag founders Jim and Mary Richards.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but ski, eat, read, play ping-pong, sit in the
steaming hot tub and sleep — in short, everything we wanted to do.</p>
<p>As soon as we stowed our bags in the Norwegian Log Cabin, we set out on
the Sukkerbusk Trail to Twin Lakes, stopping only when we realized dusk
was falling with the flakes.</p>
<p>Then we came back for a meal of marinated flank steak, potatoes, green
beans and blueberry pie with whipped cream.</p>
<p>During the night, Jim Richards drove to the Amtrak depot in Detroit
Lakes to pick up three women from Chicago, and after that, they became
our dinner companions, regaling us with tales of their various adventure
trips with girlfriends, daughters and, occasionally, husbands.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/maplelag_six_swedes.jpg" alt="Skiers glide by the Six Swedes cabin at Maplelag." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Skiers pass one of Maplelag's Six Swedes cabin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For years, they'd been making the 12-hour train trip to Maplelag from
the Chicago area.</p>
<p>&quot;Our husbands ask if we can't find someplace closer,&quot; said Carol
Schumacher of Palatine, Ill. &quot;Every year we consider not coming, but
then we think, no, we have to come.&quot;</p>
<p>It was their winter break, and, like us, they found nothing more
relaxing than a day of skiing and eating, with a midafternoon break for
peach tea and a snickerdoodle, then an aprés-ski soak in the steam room
or hot tub.</p>
<p>Jay and Jim Richards kept the Pisten Bully going on the resort's 64
kilometers of trails, and we followed them, stopping once so Jay could
snap our picture amid the snow-flocked boughs.</p>
<p>Then we had to leave. Feeling a little blue after we got home, we
checked the resort's website and found Jay had posted our photo and 24
others of the big snowfall.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;I thought I would make a photo album because I will always remember
this day in my head,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It will be nice to have the visual
when it is 90 degrees in the middle of July and I will be sitting in the
cab of the Pisten Bully dreaming about this day.&quot;</p>
<p>For skiers, Maplelag is as good as it gets. But not everyone can afford
a vacation there, and luckily, there are many other lodges and
housekeeping cabins where guests can ski right from their door.</p>
<p>If you want to save money on meals, bring a crock pot and a pot roast,
and you'll be greeted by tantalizing aromas after a long day of skiing.</p>
<p>Below are some of the best resorts for skiing out the door.</p>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.maplelag.com">Maplelag Resort</a>, Callaway:</strong>
This resort near Detroit Lakes is one of
a kind. Sitting on a slight rise where hardwood forest meets prairie,
it's the first spot to catch snow from the Rockies, and its proprietors
keep trails impeccably groomed even in marginal conditions.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_yurt_night.jpg" alt="Tall Pines Yurt on the Gunflint Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Banadad Trail, skiers can stay either in the Tall Pines Yurt or
the Poplar Creek Guesthouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong>Note: The lodge burned to the ground in October 2022. Only the trails are available for use in 2023.</strong></p>
<p>There's a variety of accommodations, from rustic pioneer cabins to Great
Northern cabooses. Meals are served family-style in the dining room.</p>
<p>Guests bring their own sleeping bags, pillows and towels, though they
can be rented. Ski equipment in all sizes can be rented, as well as
snowshoes and kick sleds for hauling small children.</p>

Trail Center, Ted and Barbara Young offer accommodations along the
29-kilometer Banadad Trail, from which guests can ski or snowshoe into
the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.</p>
<p>Their Poplar Creek Guesthouse is very attractive and has two B&amp;B rooms,
one with two beds and one with a double whirlpool. The B&amp;B rooms share a
common area with a gas fireplace and kitchenette.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The Tall Pine Yurt, a round canvas hut with a kitchen and wood stove,
sleeps four. A sauna is nearby. The Croft Yurt is on the Banadad Ski
Trail and is available in winter as an overnight ski-touring stop.</p>

<p>From Bearskin, skiers can glide over for
hot chocolate and cookies at Golden Eagle Lodge, which has a mixture of
older and new cabins, some with whirlpools, and a 1945 lodge. A
