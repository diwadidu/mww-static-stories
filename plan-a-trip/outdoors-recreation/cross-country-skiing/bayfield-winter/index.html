<p>In the vacation town of Bayfield, action shifts to the woods in winter.</p>
<p>In summer, everyone gravitates to Lake Superior and its cruise launches,
sailboats, ferries and kayaks. But when it snows, the locomotion is on
inland trails.</p>
<p>And it does snow. Gales over the big lake deliver plenty for skiers,
snowmobilers and mushers.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Bayfield in winter, a blizzard buried the town.
But the next time, conditions were perfect.</p>
<p>We started our weekend on the Brownstone Trail right out of Bayfield,
skiing by the light of luminaries placed by the Bayfield Regional
Conservancy. The trail heads south along Chequamegon Bay, past Seagull
Bay, one of the last great mom-and-pop motels.</p>
<p>We were staying there along with mushers, in town for the Apostle
Islands Sled Dog Race, and the parking lot was filled with straw bales
and husky hotels.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We drove 10 miles west the next day to watch the race from one of the
peninsula's many gravel pits, dropped by the same glacier that created
the inland hills prized today by skiers and berry farmers.</p>
<p>There's nothing quite like watching packs of howling, dancing huskies
explode from a starting line, and I watched raptly with Vicki Seeger of
Big Lake, Minn., who raises her own dogs with her husband, Steve.</p>
<p>&quot;I just don't understand why more people don't come and watch, it's
so fun,&quot; she said. &quot;We got addicted to it. We had to sell our house
on a lake to go somewhere where we could have dogs.&quot;</p>
<p>Seeger was cheering for her daughter, Heather Monroe of Princeton, Minn.</p>
<p>&quot;Heather had been riding a sled since she was 7, but then she saved her
babysitting money and said, 'I'm not going to ride anymore,' &quot; she
said. &quot;She bought two dogs of her own and then a sled.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/bayfield_ashwabay_children_alpine.jpg" alt="Children skiing at Mount Ashwabay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Children head down the hill at Mount Ashwabay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Another youngster got her start that day in the family/recreation class,
and in her little fur-trimmed parka, she was even cuter than her dogs.
Her mother, Mary Thiel of Bayfield's Wolfsong Adventures, helped her
get ready, but then Emma Thiel was on her own, disappearing down the
trail behind three huskies.</p>
<p>From the race, we headed for the hills ourselves, to the trails of
Valhalla Recreation Area. Snowmobilers had built a big fire in the
shelter, and we joined them to eat lunch.</p>
<p>A light snow was falling, just enough to flock the trees, as we headed
onto the Valkyrie Trail's Loop C, a 10-kilometer ribbon that winds
through stands of red pine and oak up to a ridge and back.</p>
<p>Groomed for striding only, it's suited for quiet contemplation of snow
and scenery.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On the other side of County Road C, the Teuton Trail is its perkier
sister. Groomed for skating as well as striding, it winds up and around
gentle hills before ending in a long, exhilarating glide down.</p>
<p>In Washburn, we had dinner at Good Thyme restaurant. It's one of our
favorites, sophisticated but completely unpretentious.</p>
<p>It's also a community hangout and a good place to pick up the local
news; our jovial waiter cracked jokes as he brought us Thai salmon salad
and saffron linguine with chicken and sun-dried tomatoes.</p>
<p>The next day, we skied at Mount Ashwabay, named for the three
Chequamegon Bay towns of Ashland, Washburn and Bayfield.</p>
<p>Now owned by a non-profit coalition, it's the little ski hill that
could, with 14 alpine runs, 35 kilometers of cross-country trails, six
kilometers of fat-bike trails, a cozy chalet with two stone fireplaces
and a heap of small-town friendliness.</p>
<p>&quot;Your cross-country pass includes the T-bar, though we'll give you a
ride up on a snowmobile if you want,&quot; said Cliff Grand, one of the
locals who raised money to save the hill, also the summer home of Big
Top Chautauqua. &quot;Want to go up now and check it out?&quot;</p>

A team pulls out of the starting line of the Apostle Islands Sled Dog
Race.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We already knew we wanted to ski there. We headed out on narrow striding
trails, through snow-laden firs, as the day brightened.</p>
<p>Eventually, we found ourselves at the top of the alpine hill, where we
drank in the panoramic view of Chequamegon Bay. All weekend, we'd seen
nothing but beauty.</p>
<p>&quot;It'd be fun to live here,&quot; my husband said. &quot;We sure could get a
lot of skiing in.&quot;</p>
<p>On the Bayfield Peninsula, everyone wants to be a local.</p>
