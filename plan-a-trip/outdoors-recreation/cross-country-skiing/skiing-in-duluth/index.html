<h2>When snow falls, skiers fly onto a splendid system of groomed trails.</h2>

<p>One March, I went up to Duluth but woke up in Siberia.</p>
<p>Twenty inches of snow had fallen overnight. A savage 70 mph wind was
howling around the glass-walled lobby of the Willard Munger Inn.
Swirling snow had turned the air white.</p>
<p>But then my niece and I noticed cars crawling along Grand Avenue. Then
more cars. So we bundled up, got in our car and, to our surprise, made
it all the way across town to Lester Park.</p>
<p>Dozens of other skiers already had been on the Lester-Amity Ski Trail,
creating tracks that we gratefully followed into the sheltering forest.</p>
<p>Duluth is a tough town. When its skiers want to ski, nothing stops them.</p>
<p>Of course, none of them has to go far. Duluth's hills, ravines and
creeks create pockets of wilderness into which the city has tucked 45
kilometers of trails.</p>
<p>Two privately owned ski areas, also within city limits, add another 37
kilometers, and just across the Bong Bridge, Superior Municipal Forest
includes 26 kilometers of scenic trails.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's heaven for skiers. In the middle of the city, they're immersed in
wilderness-yet 10 minutes away from a really good restaurant or
coffeehouse.</p>
<p>When snow falls, trails are groomed and tracked right along with
Duluth's streets and sidewalks. Within 10 to 12 hours of a half-foot
snowfall, says city forester Kelly Fleissner, all the city trails are
groomed.</p>
<p>&quot;If we get a snowfall, we'll be out there almost immediately,&quot; says
Fleissner, an avid skier who heads the grooming staff and says his
&quot;might be the best job in America.&quot;</p>
<p>Lester-Amity is the city's most popular ski trail, being gorgeous as
well as easy to reach, just off Superior Street.</p>
<p>Skiing up the Lester River through a dense corridor of spruce, then
along the rim of the Amity Creek gorge, my niece and I listened to the
murmur of the wind and studied the pale winter palette of birch bark and
beige grasses furling out of the snow.</p>
<p>Passing Seven Bridges Road, we started downhill back into the firs, and
behind me I heard an exhilarated &quot;Whoooooa&quot; turning into &quot;Wooooow . .
. That was beautiful.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_bardons_skiers.jpg" alt="Skiers on Bardons Peak in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From Bardon's Peak on the Magney-Snively Trail, there's a panoramic
view of Duluth.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From Lester Park, we drove up Duluth's precariously steep streets to
Snowflake Nordic Center. No one was in the wind-whipped chalet except
its proprietor, George Hovland, who skied for the United States in the
1952 Olympics and remained prominent in ski circles until his death in
2021.</p>
<p>As he drew us a minutely detailed map of the trails, he chitchatted
about global warming, politicians and course topography. But after he
told us that he named Snowflake because medieval Norwegians wore mittens
knitted in a snowflake pattern, we realized we had to take it all with a
grain of salt.</p>
<p>&quot;It's pretty deep out there-and in here, too,&quot; he noted slyly.</p>
<p>He told us we could ski free, and we headed out on tracks that were
decent, though drifted in by the wind. Hovland hates to close Snowflake,
so he tries to keep it open even in poor conditions.</p>
<p>After skiing at Snowflake, we found our way to the nearby Hartley trail,
almost getting stuck on the dead-end lane that leads to it. But after a
kilometer of skiing, we tired of the incessant wind and headed back to
the motel.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The next day was colder, but the wind had died and the sun was bright in
a frosty blue sky. Feeling inexplicably ambitious, we headed up to
Magney-Snively Park, on heavily forested hills just beyond Spirit
Mountain.</p>
<p>Its parking lot had been cleared, but the trail, which heads straight
up, hadn't been groomed. New tracks ended after a kilometer-we could
see the cross-hatches left as the lone skier gave up and turned around
-but we kept plowing on through 2-foot drifts.</p>
<p>We felt like pioneers, trying to follow old tracks that would pop up,
like ruts on the Oregon Trail, then disappear under drifts.
Occasionally, our ski tips caught under the snow and we tumbled onto our
faces in a flurry of powder.</p>
<p>Our payoff came at the Bardon's Peak overlook, where we drank in a
sweeping view of the St. Louis River estuary-Spirit Lake, Clough
Island, St. Louis Bay, the Bong Bridge.</p>
<p>As we sat, exhausted, on a wooden bench, another skier passed on his way
to Bardon's Peak. We told him to enjoy our tracks, and he thanked us
and said he already was.</p>

<p>After a well-earned lunch of burgers and malts at Grandma's on Canal
Park, we drove up the Piedmont trail, just off U.S. 53 next to a
residential neighborhood. The groomer had just finished the loop, and I
could've kissed its crisp corduroy.</p>
<p>The skiing was perfect, through light forest on wide, rolling lanes and
screamer hills that had been turned into pussycats by top-notch
grooming.</p>
<p>Wooden signs put up by a neighborhood skier gave us a few chuckles: Go
Dis Vay, No Laughing Zone, Finland 7,000 Miles. A Chicken Loop cutoff
led around a hill marked Evil Knievel, and the long, gentle swoop to
trail's end was called Grand Finn Alley.</p>
<p>&quot;There really is just a plethora of great trails in Duluth,&quot; Fleissner
says. &quot;You really don't have to go far.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://duluthmn.gov/media/8975/lester-amity-xc-ski-trail-map.pdf"><strong>Lester-Amity</strong></a>
: This 15-kilometer trail, groomed for skating as well as striding, is
the most popular trail in town, easily reached from East Superior Street
at 61st Avenue. Its giant firs provide good protection from wind.</p>
<p>In early morning and evening, 4 kilometers are <em>lighted</em> . The
4-kilometer loop on the Lester Park Golf Course is good for beginners.
Off Seven Bridges Road (Occidental Boulevard), there's a <a href="https://www.duluthxc.com/lester-amity-chalet">warming
chalet</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://hartleynature.org/hartley-park/"><strong>Hartley Park</strong></a> : These
wooded loops, in a residential neighborhood, include 5 kilometers of
double-tracked classical trails. There's a hilly outer loop and a
gentler inner loop, good for families and beginners.</p>
<p>Normally, Hartley Nature Center rents skis and snowshoes, but check in
advance in 2021. The trailhead is north of UMD, off Woodland Avenue.</p>

<p><a href="https://duluthmn.gov/media/8979/piedmont-xc-ski-trail-map.pdf"><strong>Piedmont</strong></a>
: This 5.5-kilometer trail in the hills near Enger Park, off Hutchinson
Road (reached from U.S. 53/Piedmont Avenue), is mostly double-tracked
for classic skiing and includes an overlook of the St. Louis River
valley.</p>
<p>There's a 1-kilometer easy loop groomed for skate and classic. It's
not too hilly and is good for beginners and intermediates.</p>
<p><a href="https://duluthmn.gov/media/8978/magney-xc-ski-trail-map.pdf"><strong>Magney-Snively</strong></a>
: This hilly 14-kilometer trail has a classic track and a skate lane and
is best for intermediate and advanced skiers. The trail winds from
Snively Park to the city limits and adjoining Magney Park, each of which
has a stunning overlook.</p>
<p>The parking lot is two miles past Spirit Mountain on Skyline Parkway,
just past the dragon's-tooth stone bridge over Stewart Creek. Skiers
also can reach it via the Connector trail from Spirit Mountain.</p>
<p>There are two tricky parts. A snowmobile trail cuts through the Ely Peak
Loop, and the one-way ski trail looks as if it ends there, but it
continues across the snowmobile trail and just to the right.</p>
<p>And at the end, there's a steep downhill that ends in the road;
non-experts should take off their skis and walk.</p>

who frequent Snowflake, and classic skiers may feel squeezed at times.</p>

<p>To reach it, take U.S. 53 past Enger Park to Arlington Avenue, which
turns into Rice Lake Road past West Arrowhead Road.</p>
