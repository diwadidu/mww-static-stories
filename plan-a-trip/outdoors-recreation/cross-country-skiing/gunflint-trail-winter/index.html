<h2>On the edge of the Boundary Waters, Nordic skiers find snow that sparkles into April.</h2>

<p>While people in cities to the south are looking for crocuses, folks on
northeast Minnesota's Gunflint Trail are enjoying some of the best
skiing of the year.</p>
<p>It's not that the Gunflint is so much colder. It's that there's so
much snow it keeps itself refrigerated, like glaciers.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a really good base,&quot; says Heather Telchow of Golden Eagle
Lodge. &quot;Even after these warm days, the snow is like brand new. I grew
up in Faribault, and I'm used to it disappearing in a few days. But we
don't lose snow like that up here. We keep it forever.&quot;</p>
<p>Looking for a reprieve from spring slush? Head for the 57-mile Gunflint
Trail, which dead-ends in Minnesota's Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the 1920s, when the first resorts appeared along this remote stretch,
high season was summer. Now, impeccably groomed ski trails, snowmobile
paths and sled-dog excursions give it even more cachet in winter.</p>
<p>I was there one year with a group from the North Stars Ski Touring Club,
and the skiing was magnificent. On the first day of March, after a light
snowfall, we drove to Golden Eagle Lodge in the Central Gunflint,
passing a group of snowshoers heading up the Honeymoon Bluff Trail.</p>
<p>On Flour Lake, Golden Eagle Resort grooms nearly 70 kilometers
with the McCloughans of neighboring Bearskin Lodge, and its trails are
top of the line.</p>
<p>From the 1945 log lodge, we followed the Old Logging Camp Trail above
deep, narrow Flour Lake, which looked like a Norwegian fjord sunk deep
into forest.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_golden_eagle_lodge.jpg" alt="Golden Eagle Lodge on the Gunflint." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The sun was shining in a blue sky, new snow flocked the boughs of balsam
fir, and we could hardly believe our luck as we cruised up the Deer
Mouse Trail.</p>
<p>We returned to the lodge on Red Pine, cutting back and forth along the
hill's flank like alpine skiers, admiring the northwoods panorama from
the beautifully designed trail.</p>
<p>&quot;This is why we live in Minnesota,&quot; said Connie, echoing what we all
were thinking.</p>
<p>Back at the cozy lodge, Teresa Baumann served us mugs of hot chocolate,
topped with whipped cream, and a plate of cookies. Then, on her
suggestion, we headed across the frozen lake and skied the trails on the
south side of Flour Lake.</p>
<p>From the Beaver Dam Trail, we emerged onto the open Moose Pasture. Wind
gusts made it a little bit of Siberia after the protected woods, and we
remembered that life on the isolated Gunflint Trail isn't always fun
and games.</p>
<p>But soon we were back in the woods and climbing to pine-covered Ridge
Run, where we stopped at a few of the viewpoints to look down at the
glacier-scoured lake.</p>

Bearskin and Golden Eagle lodges maintain 70 kilometers of groomed
trails on the Central Gunflint.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Cross-country skiing doesn't get any better than that. I've skied from
Golden Eagle and Bearskin Lodge on other trips, and it's always good.</p>
<p>Once, I skied from Bearskin on the last day of March and had to leave,
reluctantly, as gently falling snow brought a fresh coating to the
trails.</p>
<p>Both lodges also have lighted loops, for a little cruise in the dark;
Golden Eagle hangs kerosene lanterns on its trail, and Bearskin uses
strings of twinkle lights.</p>
<p>Best of all, all the lodges on the Gunflint offer lower rates in March.
Days are longer, and it's warm enough to have a picnic on the trail. If
you can push aside those daydreams of daffodils, &quot;spring&quot; is the
time to go.</p>

<p><strong>Accommodations:</strong> Skiing generally is
good from November through March, and often into April. Lodge rates go
down in March, not because the snow isn't good, but because many people
forget it's so good.</p>
<p>Cross-country ski trails are best on the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/superior/recarea/?recid=64781">Central
Gunflint</a>, where <a href="http://www.golden-eagle.com/">Golden Eagle</a> and
<a href="http://www.bearskin.com/">Bearskin</a> use a Pisten Bully to groom 70
kilometers of trails. Both lodges have short loops lighted at night.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.golden-eagle.com">Golden Eagle Lodge</a> has a mixture of older
and new cabins, some with whirlpools, and a log lodge. 800-346-2203.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bearskin.com">Bearskin Lodge</a> has very nice traditional
cabins and lodge suites. There's a large Hot Tub Hus. The owners are
avid cross-country skiers. 800-338-4170.</p>
<p>On the other side of the road, on the Banadad Trail, Ted and Barbara
Young of <a href="http://www.boundarycountry.com/">Boundary Country Trekking</a>
rent two B&amp;B rooms, 800-322-8327.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_hestons.jpg" alt="Heston's Lodge on the Gunflint." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Cross-country skiers love folksy Heston's Lodge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On Poplar Lake, the <a href="https://poplarhaus.com/cabins/">Poplar Haus</a> rents
five log cabins, all dog-friendly, and has a popular restaurant and the
trail's only liquor store.</p>
<p>Also on Poplar Lake, <a href="https://www.bigbearlodgemn.com/">Big Bear Lodge</a>
rents three lodge rooms, five knotty-pine cabins with wood-burning
fireplaces and a camper cabin that sleeps six. The lodge serves beer,
wine and pizza. There's a lakeside sauna, and guests get free use of
canoes. 218-388-0172.</p>
<p>On the Upper Gunflint, skiing is hillier and not quite as wooded, thanks
to the 1999 blowdown and 2007 wildfire. There's lots to do, though.</p>
<p>On Gunflint Lake, <a href="http://www.gunflint.com">Gunflint Lodge</a> is a
full-service resort with modern townhouse units that have VCRs,
fireplaces and whirlpools or saunas.</p>
<p>It's got a fine restaurant and bistro in its lodge, and a naturalist
leads activities. On weekends, it hosts many snowmobilers.</p>

<a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/gunflint-lodge-trail/">A Gunflint legend</a>.</p>
<p>Just down the road, also on Gunflint Lake, <a href="http://www.gunflintpines.com/">Gunflint
Pines</a> has a nice lodge and A-frames,
800-533-5814.</p>
<p>Cross-country skiers love folksy <a href="http://www.hestons.com/">Heston's
Lodge</a>, which has lakeshore log cabins, a
sauna and an outdoor wood-fired pizza oven. 800-338-7230.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crossriverlodge.com/">Cross River Lodge</a>, formerly
Moosehorn Lodge, has cabins and B&amp;B rooms, 888-238-5975.</p>
<p><strong>Dining:</strong>  Don't miss dinner at the
<a href="http://www.trailcenterlodge.com/restaurant.html">Trail Center Lodge</a>,
in the central Gunflint. The outside, built for a 1930s logging camp,
isn't much to look at, but the inside is adorned with a hodgepodge of
old tin signs, moose racks, loggers' saws, wooden wheels and snowshoes.</p>
<p>What's more, the food is very good, and it's served in a hearty atmosphere that transcends the usual
skier-snowmobiler divisions. 218-388-2214.</p>
<p>Just up the road, tables at the more modern <a href="https://poplarhaus.com/restaurant/">Poplar Haus
restaurant</a> have a nice view of the
lake. The menus is small but includes burgers, sandwiches, pizzas and
small plates served with creative flair, plus cocktails and craft beer.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gunflint.com/dining/">Gunflint Lodge</a> serves sophisticated
northwoods cuisine in its popular restaurant Justine's and more casual
fare in a bistro, both overlooking Gunflint Lake.</p>
<p><strong>Skiing:</strong> In the Central Gunflint,
Bearskin and Golden Eagle share a 70-kilometer network of trails, 36 of
them also groomed for skating, and three of them lighted.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_snowshoeing.jpg" alt="Snowshoeing near the Banadad Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Upper Gunflint, the Gunflint Lodge, Heston's, Gunflint Pines and
Moosehorn Lodge share 90 kilometers, 24 of them groomed for skating.</p>
<p>The 29-kilometer <a href="https://www.banadad.org/">Banadad Trail</a> connects the
central and upper systems and is used by Boundary Country Trekking and
lodges around Poplar Lake.</p>
<p><strong>Snowshoeing/hiking:</strong>  Thirteen miles from Grand Marais, the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/superior/recarea/?recid=37007">Northern Light Lake
Trail</a>
climbs up Blueberry Hill to its bald basalt pate and a panorama of the
lake and Brule River stretching into the distance. Sometimes the parking
lot isn't plowed, however.</p>
<p>Sixteen miles farther, turn off on County Road 66 and drive two miles,
just past the Flour Lake Campground.</p>
<p>From here, the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/superior/recreation/fishing/recarea/?recid=40303&amp;actid=50">Honeymoon Bluff
Trail</a>
climbs wooden steps to an iron-streaked cliff high above the
labyrinthine waters of Hungry Jack Lake and, beyond, West Bearskin Lake.
It's especially lovely at sunset.</p>
<p>Another four miles farther, turn onto County Road 65/Hungry Jack Road
and go to the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/superior/recreation/recarea/?recid=40353&amp;actid=50">Caribou Rock
Trail</a>
trailhead. The trail leads to overlooks of West Bearskin Lake and Moss
Lake.</p>
