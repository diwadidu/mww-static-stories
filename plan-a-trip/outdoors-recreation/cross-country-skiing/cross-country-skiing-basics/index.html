<p>The snow is back-a lot of it.</p>
<p>You can whine about it and hide indoors, or you can go out and have fun.
Ever thought about cross-country skiing? That's fun.</p>
<p>If you haven't tried the sport, here's how to get started.</p>
<p>It does take a while to get good at it, but it's fun right from the
beginning.</p>
<p>We like to think of cross-country skiing as an express pass into the
loveliest winter landscapes.</p>
<h3>Where do I get the gear?</h3>
<p>Many parks and nature centers rent ski gear (skis, boots, poles), as do
ski resorts and outdoors stores, especially ski and bike shops.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the Twin Cities, Three Rivers Parks rents
<a href="https://www.threeriversparks.org/page/winter-equipment-rentals">gear</a>
at seven park reserves, $12 for classic skis, $17 for skate skis, $8
for youths. Four <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/skiing.html">Minnesota state
parks</a>-Wild
River, Mille Lacs Kathio, Flandrau and Glendalough-rent them, $10.</p>
<p>Colleges offer great rates for weekend rentals. In Minneapolis, the
<a href="http://recwell.umn.edu/outdoor-adventures/gear-rentals-0">University of Minnesota Outdoor
Center</a>
charges $24 for a three-night rental of classic skis, $32 for skate
skis.</p>
<p>In Duluth, <a href="https://umdrsop.d.umn.edu/programs/rental-center">UMD's Outdoor
Program</a>,
218-726-6134, and <a href="https://www.css.edu/campus-life/outdoor-recreation/">Outdoor Pursuits at St.
Scholastica</a>,
218-723-6165, rent classic and skate skis. In La Crosse, the <a href="https://www.uwlax.edu/recsports/outdoors/rent-gear/">University
of Wisconsin Outdoor
Connection</a> charges
$12 daily, $5 each additional day.</p>
<p>If you want to buy gear, outdoors stores offers sales at the beginning
and end of the season. And you can find amazing deals on Craigslist,
because many people buy new gear and never use it. Just don't be one of
them!</p>
<h3>Do I want waxless, waxable or skin skis?</h3>
<p>Most rental skis are waxless, with scales on the bottom to help you grip
the snow. They don't give you a lot of glide, but they make it easier
for you to get up hills, and they're great for mushy, late-season
conditions.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/a/national_forest_lodge_skier.jpg" alt="Skiing at National Forest Lodge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Scott Stammer</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Ely and Silver Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When you get better, you'll want skis that need to be waxed. Why?
Because it's fun to go faster.</p>
<p>Don't freak out about the wax. Only racers need to worry about it.</p>
<p>Every year or so, have a shop put a glide-wax base on the bottom of your
skis, about $10. Then, every time you go skiing, slap on some kick wax
in the kick zone under your feet.</p>
<p>There are softer waxes for warmer temperatures and harder waxes for
colder temperatures. If you put on a wax that doesn't help you grip the
snow, just scrape it off and try another.</p>
<p>In icier conditions, the wax will scrape off by itself, and you'll need
to reapply. When you go out skiing, put a couple of tubes in your
pocket, along with a cork to smooth it onto your skis.</p>
<p>However, as climate changes progresses, you may want skin skis, which
have a mohair patch to grip the snow. They're more expensive than other
skis, but they deal well with the freeze-thaw cycle that plagues many
trails, and they're almost maintenance-free.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>How do I learn the technique?</h3>
<p>At first, you're going to shuffle along in the tracks. That's fine;
just concentrate on staying balanced and enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>Eventually, you'll learn to keep your weight over your feet, bend your
knees more than you think you should and kick forward. Result: glide!</p>
<p>When you need to climb a hill, splay your skis outward in a &quot;V&quot;
while digging your edges into the snow. Then throw your weight forward
and walk or jog up the hill.</p>
<p>When you need to go down a hill, you can step out of the tracks and do a
reverse &quot;V,&quot; or snowplow, again digging in your edges. Don't be
embarrassed to take your skis off and walk down the hill if it's too
steep for you.</p>
<p>Parks and nature centers offer lessons. Or just learn the basics on
Youtube.</p>
<p>And if you join an outdoors club, your fellow members will be happy to
help you with technique on ski trips. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/groups/club-travel/">Join the
club</a>.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>What should I wear?</h3>
<p>Wear less than you think you'll need, because you'll be sweating. Wear
a synthetic shirt, not cotton, and pants that won't absorb snow
(you'll probably fall once or twice).</p>
<h3>Where's a good place to ski?</h3>
<p>For beginners, golf courses work well, and many have ski centers, such
as <a href="http://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/facilities/skiTrail.cfm?id=4">Odana
Hills</a>
and <a href="http://www.universityridge.com/cross-country-skiiing">University
Ridge</a> in Madison,
<a href="https://county.milwaukee.gov/ImageLibrary/Groups/cntyParks/maps/WhitnallSki.pdf">Whitnall</a>
in Milwaukee and <a href="http://www.stpaul.gov/index.aspx?NID=5280">Como and
Highland</a> in St. Paul.</p>
<p>In the Chicago area, <a href="https://fpdcc.com/places/locations/sagawau-environmental-learning-center/">Sagawau Environment Learning
Center</a>
in Lemont has groomed trails and a lodge and offers lessons and rentals.</p>
<p>Bicycle trails are nice and flat, and many are groomed for skiing.</p>
<p>Then, move on to your local city parks, county parks, park reserves,
state parks and nature centers.
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/skiing/index.html">Minnesota</a>,
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/activities/ski.html">Wisconsin</a> and
<a href="http://www.michigan.org/skiing/cross-country/">Michigan</a> have lots of
trails.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then, go up north for a weekend. In Wisconsin,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/bayfield-winter/">Bayfield</a>,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-wisconsin/winter-wausau/">Wausau</a>,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/minocqua-winter/">Minocqua</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/winter-eagle-river/">Eagle
River</a> have lots of good trails for beginners.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, check out the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/gunflint-trail-March/">Gunflint Trail</a>, the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/ski-north-shore/">North Shore</a>,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/skiing-in-duluth/">Duluth</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/itasca-skiing/">Itasca State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>In Michigan, the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/nordic-skiing-ironwood/">Ironwood area</a> always has
good snow. It's a good place to go if you also like to ski downhill,
because it has <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/alpine-ski-ironwood/">four alpine
hills</a>.</p>
<p>If everyone in the family is learning, spend a weekend at a
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/nordic-ski-lodges/">family-friendly ski resort</a>, such as
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/afterglow-ski-resort-wisconsin/">Afterglow</a> in
northeast Wisconsin or <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/maplelag/">Maplelag</a> in northwest Minnesota.</p>
<p>If snow is sparse, head for the <a href="https://www.duluthxc.com/grand-avenue-nordic-center">Grand Avenue Nordic
Center</a> in Duluth,
<a href="http://laphampeakfriends.org/skiing/">Lapham Peak</a> near Milwaukee or in
northern Michigan at <a href="https://www.forbushcorner.com/">Forbush Corner</a>,
adjacent to Hartwick Pines State Park. All can make snow.</p>

<h3>What are the costs?</h3>
<p>It's often free to ski at golf courses and on bicycle trails. At nature
centers, it's included in admission. In state forests, there's often a
parking fee.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, many trails, including those in state parks, require a
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/licenses/skipass/index.html">state ski pass</a>, $10 daily, $25 annual.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/trailpass.html">state trails
pass</a> includes both skiing
and bicycling, $5 daily, $25 annual.</p>
<h3>What is &quot;skating,&quot; and should I do it?</h3>
<p>Skating, also called free-style skiing, is more strenuous and requires a
higher level of cardiovascular fitness and more technique, especially to
go up hills.</p>
<p>Once you learn it, however, you'll think it's a lot more fun than
striding. It's faster, and you don't need tracks.</p>
<p>You do need a packed and groomed lane. Lakes often make for good skiing,
especially later in the season, when they're crusty.</p>
<p>You also need a different kind of ski, new boots and longer poles.
They're expensive, but there's plenty of used equipment available for
beginners.</p>
