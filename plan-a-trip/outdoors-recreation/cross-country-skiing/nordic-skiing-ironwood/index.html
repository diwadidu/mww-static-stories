<h2>When most of the Upper Midwest is brown, cross-country skiers know where to find snow.</h2>

<p>In Ironwood, there's one thing people can count on besides death and
taxes.</p>
<p>Snow, and lots of it, is a sure thing in this former ore-mining town
just over the Wisconsin-Michigan border.</p>
<p>Blown in over Lake Superior, the snow starts falling as soon as days
cool down in late autumn and keeps falling until spring sun turns the
pink-tinted piles into slush.</p>
<p>Its sheer quantity often exasperates locals, but it exhilarates the
cross-country skiers who converge on the town like sheep to salt,
desperate to hear the crunch of newfallen snow and cast their eyes over
a world of white.</p>
<p>The first time I skied there, it was St. Patrick's Day weekend. On the
southern edge of Ironwood, along the Montreal River, Active Backwoods
Retreat has earned a reputation for the region's best early- and
late-season skiing.</p>
<p>There we were, in sun and 40-degree temperatures, and the skiing was
superb.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We glided along, our heads swiveling to take in the sights: an ice falls
on the north face of a hill, a vertical bluff covered with paper-thin
fungus and a sand quarry made artful by the voluptuous shadows of late
afternoon.</p>
<p>When snow slights such ski meccas as Cable, Duluth and Minocqua, skiers
head for Ironwood and its conjoined twin in Wisconsin, Hurley.</p>
<p>&quot;You can always count on the snow here,&quot; said Scott Miller of Winona,
Minn. &quot;It's just a matter of how much farther you have to drive.&quot;</p>
<p>Miller said he and his friends, all from the Winona-La Crosse area, used
to go to Cable, an hour closer to their homes.</p>
<p>Another year, in early March, I'd driven from the Cable area myself,
looking for something better than the icy crust on the trails I'd hoped
to ski there.</p>
<p>Winding my way through forest roads, past Whitecap Mountain ski hill and
through Hurley's honky-tonk downtown, I crossed the Montreal River and
drove to ABR.</p>
<p>Eric Anderson, who runs the cross-country ski area, was at the counter
selling day passes.</p>
<p>&quot;This has been the best year ever,&quot; he said, smiling. &quot;Until everyone
else gets snow, we do a great business.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/r/ironwood_jodi.jpg" alt="Skiers at ABR in Ironwood." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Jodi Stammer</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>In the parking lot, Melva Cain of Burnsville, Minn., and Lee Pedersen of
North St. Paul were getting ready to ski.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't get to ski at all last year, and we're not going to let that
happen again,&quot; Cain said. &quot;We're going where there's snow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If Mother Nature doesn't cooperate, we have to do something,&quot; Pedersen
said. The two had tried to find a room in the Ironwood area but instead
landed at a B&amp;B in Manitowish Waters, 40 minutes south in the snow belt
of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no snow there,&quot; Cain said. &quot;So this is the place to find
snow.&quot;</p>
<p>After skiing several loops on the rolling terrain at ABR — along the
river, through open meadows, through forest and past an ice fall — I
headed east of town to Wolverine, a volunteer-run system of trails just
south of Big Powderhorn, one of three downhill ski slopes along the
range of hills between U.S. 2 and Lake Superior.</p>
<p>Wolverine Ski Club organized in 1935 as a ski-jumping club and, as its
Finnish founders aged, switched to cross-country skiing. Now it has a
cozy chalet, with a wood stove, hot chocolate and coffee and homemade
cookies.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;It's nice when outdoor winter activities can become a lifestyle, and
you can count on it,&quot; said member Bruce Greenberg, who was leading a
children's ski outing. &quot;We're here for the community, we're here for
everybody — recreational skiing, ski-joring, people out with their
pets.&quot;</p>
<p>Wolverine's 54 acres also have more hills than ABR, and many fewer
skiers. I saw only a few people as I skied, though conditions were very
good.</p>
<p>And it has some lovely stretches; once, at the top of a run made shadowy
and mysterious by a grove of white pine, I had to stop and just take in
the view.</p>
<p>As the sun began to sink and I started driving back to my lodge room in
Seeley, snow started to fall. By the time I was 15 minutes into
Wisconsin it was blowing horizontally into my windshield, and I had to
creep along the forest roads.</p>
<p>That Sunday morning there was snow on the trails around Cable, but none
of them were groomed. For Cable, it was a case of too little, too late.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Nordic skiing in Ironwood, Michigan</h3>

via U.S. 2 across Wisconsin from Duluth and 5½ to 6 hours from
Milwaukee.</p>

<p><em>Events:</em> Weekend after New Year's Eve, January, <a href="http://www.sisuskifest.com/">Sisu Ski Fest</a>. This
Finnish fest includes a 5K fun ski, a snowshoe tour and 15K and 31K
races through historic mining areas, scenic bluffs and along the
Montreal River.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.skiabr.com/">Active Backwoods
Retreat</a> in Ironwood, Mich.:</strong><br>
This ski area, on the outskirts of
Ironwood along the Montreal River, has the most reliable snow in the
region by far, and skiing usually continues into April.</p>
<p>It has 60 kilometers of beautifully groomed skating and striding trails
and a 4-kilometer snowshoeing loop on more than 600 acres.</p>
<p>To get there, turn south from U.S. 2 onto Lake Street and follow signs
onto Frenchtown Road and South Range Road.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wolverinenordic.com">Wolverine Nordic Trails</a>:  This
volunteer-run system in the north part of town has 25 kilometers for skating
and classical; they're maintained by donations to the Wolverine Ski
Club ($10 is suggested).</p>
<p>Dogs are allowed, and there's also a snowshoe trail.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's adjacent to the Big Powderhorn alpine area. To get there, drive a
mile east of town on U.S. 2, turn north on Section 12 Road and drive 1.3
miles, turn east on Sunset Road and drive half a mile until you see the
Wolverine chalet on the right, across from Lookout Lane.</p>
<p>At Big Powderhorn, Nordic skiers can buy a one-ride lift ticket and
reach Wolverine's 7-kilometer Powderhorn Loop by skiing off Lift No. 4.</p>
