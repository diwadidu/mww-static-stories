<h2>Around this snowy Wisconsin town, there's a trail for everyone.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/a/eagle_river_snowmobiles.jpg" alt="Snowmobiles roar toward Eagle River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Snowmobiles head into downtown Eagle River.

<p>To the uninitiated, the vast expanses of forest around Eagle River,
Wis., look like a lot of nothing.</p>
<p>It's rocky, useless land, forfeited to the government during the
Depression, and hardly anyone lives there — Eagle River, pop. 1,400,
is Vilas County's only city.</p>
<p>This empty forest, however, draws thousands, and on winter weekends,
it's not so empty. Snowmobilers, skiers and snowshoers come to these
woods &amp;mndash; to the east and north lie the 657,000 square acres of
Nicolet National Forest, and to the west, the 220,00 acres of Northern
Highland-American Legion State Forest.</p>
<p>Each is veined with trails and pocked by lakes — together, Vilas and
Oneida counties have the world's densest concentration of lakes.</p>
<p>Eagle River has the largest inland chain of freshwater lakes in the
world, 28 in all, and is just below the headwaters of the Wisconsin
River, the state's longest.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The lakes, however, are just scenery. It's the 500 miles of trails that
make it snowmobile heaven. Eagle River calls itself the Snowmobile
Capital of the World, and it's not an inflated boast.</p>
<p>The town has been hosting the World Championship Snowmobile Derby since
1964, and the Snowmobile Racing Hall of Fame is just down the road, in
St. Germain.</p>
<p>Nearby Sayner is the machine's birthplace; it was invented in 1924 by a
trapper who had a deformed foot and wanted to get to his trap lines
faster.</p>
<p>It's the hub of an area that readers of Snow Goer magazine regularly
vote Best Trail Riding and Best Area Catering to Families in North
America.</p>
<p>Snowmobiles roar through Eagle River like the Chicago &amp; Northwestern
trains that once brought summer tourists from the cities, and, like the
trains, disgorge their passengers into the diners that line Railroad
Street.</p>
<p>The skiers and snowshoers are not so easy to spot, but they're there,
too.</p>

<p>I met every kind of winter-sports enthusiast when I was there, and snow
was thigh-deep in the forests. Trees for Tomorrow, an
environmental-learning center at the edge of town, was filled with
skiers enrolled in a clinic.</p>
<p>The complex of log buildings, surrounded by pines and built by the
Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, is arranged around a large
oval, crossed by tracks on which students practice before vans take them
to nearby trails.</p>
<p>Snowmobilers were whizzing past the renovated rail depot, where
volunteers have built an ice palace since 1938, when conditions allow. In the parking lot of
the depot, now the visitors' center, Paul Vangelisti of Plainfield,
Ill., was waiting for his family to catch up.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the best place to snowmobile in the country,&quot; he said.
&quot;That's what all the magazines say, and it's true. The trails are
smooth, they're 8 feet wide, and there aren't many people.&quot; Then
his daughter, Gina, and her mother, Jeannie Baxter, zoomed up.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not athletic, and I never have been,&quot; Jeannie Baxter said.
&quot;But on a snowmobile, I can be competitive; I can keep up.&quot;  She
does love the rush of engine power, she said, but doesn't understand
those who speed through the forest without looking around.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;It's gorgeous out there,&quot; she said. &quot;You can stop in the middle
of the trail, look up at the blue sky, maybe see an eagle. You can see
the snow plopping off the trees.&quot;</p>
<p>In a shop, I met Lu Ann Williams of Madison. She and her husband, Gary,
had invited seven friends to their cabin in Three Lakes for a weekend of
snowshoeing.</p>
<p>&quot;It was so beautiful out there last night; we went out at midnight, and
there was a full moon,&quot; she said. &quot;The beauty of snowshoeing is, you
don't need a trail; you can go where other people can't get.&quot;</p>
<p>With a mischievous smile, Gary Williams added, &quot;Motorized sports are
for wussies.&quot;</p>
<p>The silent-sports folks never have cottoned to snowmobilers. But around
Eagle River it doesn't matter who's fueled by gorp and who by
gasoline, because there's room for everyone.</p>
<p>With so much public land and reliable snowfall, snowshoeing is
particularly good here, and the forest canopy holds the snow into the
spring.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Those who don't even want to hear a snowmobile can head across the
Michigan border to the 21,000 acres of Sylvania Wilderness. Part of the
vast Ottawa National Forest, it's a miniature Boundary Waters Canoe Area, with 19 lakes
connected by portages.</p>
<p>Skiing is as close as the rolling Nordmarka trails out of the scenic
Eagle River Golf Course, and Anvil Lake, eight miles east of town in
Nicolet National Forest.</p>
<p>Anvil Lake is particularly popular for the chickadees and nuthatches
that roost in a balsam fir and ironwood outside the warming cabin and
take sunflower seeds out of the hands of skiers.</p>
<p>Trail groomers bring the seeds today, carrying on a longtime tradition.</p>
<p>The snow usually lasts into March in Eagle River. After the snow melts,
the musky fishermen will arrive — Boulder Junction, a Vilas County
hamlet to the northwest, has patented the title Musky Capital of the
World — followed by legions of summer visitors.</p>
<p>They'll make the little town hop. But with all those forests and lakes,
there'll be room for everyone.</p>
