<h2>In a snowy Minnesota wilderness, guests get the best of two worlds.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_yurt_night.jpg" alt="Tall Pines Yurt on the Gunflint Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On a 30-below night in January, the Tall Pines Yurt was toasty warm.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When it's 30 below in the north woods, that's nothing like a cold day
in Siberia.</p>
<p>It's more like a cold day in Mongolia.</p>
<p>Temperatures were dangerously low over New Year's when we drove with
friends to the Gunflint Trail, but we knew a wood fire would be waiting
for us in a round, canvas-sided hut called a yurt, or ger in Mongolia.</p>
<p>The peaked-roof huts work for nomads on the Mongolian steppes, and they
work for skiers in Minnesota's north woods, too. Our yurt, part of Ted
and Barbara Young's Little Ollie Lake Lodging, had a futon sofa, bunks,
a kitchen and an acrylic dome to let in the moonlight.</p>
<p>A propane-fueled chandelier provided light and a wood stove kicked out
heat, keeping everyone toasty warm.</p>
<p>We'd planned to ski from yurt to yurt on the 28-kilometer Banadad
Trail, a balsam-lined corridor that starts next to the Youngs' Poplar
Creek Guesthouse B&amp;B and soon enters the Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But a forecast of 40 to 50 below temperatures with wind chill changed
our plans.</p>
<p>&quot;In this kind of weather, people don't stop to eat or drink, and they
get to the yurt chilled and dehydrated,&quot; Ted Young said with regret.
&quot;Why don't you stay in the yurt tonight to get the experience, and then
stay in the B&amp;B tomorrow?&quot;</p>
<p>We didn't argue. First a yurt, then a luxury B&amp;B: Anyone could see that
was the best of two worlds.</p>
<p>Young hauled our stuff by snowmobile to the Tall Pines Yurt, half a mile
from the B&amp;B, where we heated up dinner in the propane oven. Then we
headed outside: There was a full moon in a clear sky, and we didn't want
to waste it.</p>
<p>Piling a parka over my snowsuit, I headed out first, walking across
Hooker Lake and onto a narrow trail that seemed cool and mysterious, in
a Hansel-and-Gretel kind of way-until I started wondering if wolves
were out and about.</p>
<p>And why wouldn't they be? We were. So I went back and waited until a
column of gray figures began to emerge from across the lake. Together,
we walked to Swamp Lake, where we left a choir of snow angels flapping
under the stars.</p>
<p>In the morning, we compared notes about who got up to feed the fire and
who had awoken with moon rays in her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I call that a high-noon moon,&quot; said my friend Debra. &quot;It was almost
like daytime.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_gray_jay.jpg" alt="A gray jay on the Gunflint Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

tourists.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Heading for the outhouse after breakfast, I noticed a plumped-up whiskey
jack next to our deck, looking like a Christmas ornament clipped to a
spruce top.</p>
<p>I was glad for the wildlife sighting until I realized that these jays
are the Oliver Twists of the bird world, always angling for their next
morsel.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd throw out a piece of bread, and he'd pick it up and wait, hoping
I'd throw another,&quot; my friend John said.</p>
<p>Soon it was time to leave our wood stove and start producing our own
heat. Even at 10 below, that was surprisingly easy to do. The wind never
did kick up, and snowshoeing across Swamp Lake felt like a day at the
beach, with brilliant sun bouncing off acres of snow.</p>
<p>Some of us skied down the flat Banadad Trail and into the BWCA. The rest
of us skied the rolling loops of the Lace Lake Trail, then went
snowshoeing.</p>
<p>Extreme cold had frozen clumps of snow to pine boughs, giving the
landscape that winter-wonderland look that usually wears off a few days
after a snowfall. Walking down a narrow portage trail, John suddenly
stopped to savor the view.</p>
<p>&quot;Hold on a minute,&quot; he said. &quot;I've been looking down instead of up, and
it's so beautiful here.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When we returned to the guesthouse, our faces were framed with curly
tendrils of ice, like frozen sparks of electricity. Chin stubble had
turned into full white beards and eyelashes into icy nubs.</p>
<p>Why did we drive six hours north when we could have been cold close to
home? Because the Gunflint Trail has a silence and a serenity not found
in other places. The snow is different, too-whiter, brighter and
plentiful, usually lasting into April.</p>
<p>Once you arrive, you don't want to leave. Ted Young first saw the
Gunflint on a family camping trip when he was 14, and he honeymooned
there with Barbara in 1964. They moved to an island on Poplar Lake in
1974.</p>
<p>In 1983, they started a trekking business, and they became yurt pioneers
a year later, when Ted wanted to offer lodge-to-lodge skiing on the
Banadad Trail.</p>
<p>The U.S. Forest Service wouldn't allow a permanent dwelling on federal
land. So  when Barbara read about the tent-like yurts in Cross Country
Skier magazine, she suggested they get one.</p>
<p>But Ted said, &quot;That's silly; who's going to stay in that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Those were Ted's exact words,&quot; Barbara Young says with a laugh. &quot;Six
months later, another resorter said, 'I just read something fascinating
about yurts,' and Ted looked into it and said, 'This is something we
should look into.' &quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_lace_lake.jpg" alt="Skiing on the Lace Lake Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>They ordered a kit, and Barbara sewed the canvas, grommet holes and all,
on a portable machine in a one-room cabin without electricity. The first
year, they had to take the yurt down in spring, but then they got
permission to leave it up.</p>
<p>&quot;When we started, we called it a hut, because we didn't think anyone
would know what a yurt was,&quot; Ted Young said. &quot;But now everyone in the
skiing community knows what they are, so after three or four years, we
changed it to yurt.&quot;</p>
<p>On the first day, their guests stay at the Tall Pines Yurt near the
guesthouse, where they can choose to eat a Mongolian firepot dinner,
served in traditional copper pots. It's as authentic as the Youngs can
make it, except guests get beef, chicken and shrimp instead of yak and
mutton.</p>
<p>The next day, they ski 18 kilometers to the Croft Yurt on Bedew Lake,
and by the time they arrive, staffers have delivered their gear by
snowmobile and made the fire.</p>
<p>The next day, guests ski 12 kilometers to the western trailhead on the
Gunflint Trail, where they find their car.</p>
<p>We didn't get to do that. Instead, we sipped wine and played dominoes in
front of the gas fire in the guest common area, outfitted with
Mission-style furniture and cool north-woods mementos-an Ojibwe
cradleboard, a stag head, historic photos.</p>
<p>We joined Ted and Barbara downstairs for stories about their early days
on the Gunflint Trail, when they groomed ski trails by dragging bed
springs behind a snowmobile. And we slept soundly under luxurious down
duvets and brocade throws.</p>
<p>We didn't get to brag about skiing yurt to yurt. But at 30 below, we had
zero regrets.</p>

<p>[<strong>Skiing and snowshoeing</strong> : The

<p><strong>Dining</strong> : Across Poplar Lake, the Trail
Center's Black Bear Bar &amp; Restaurant is very convivial. The outside,
built for a 1930s logging camp, isn't much to look at, but the inside
is adorned with a hodgepodge of old tin signs, moose racks, loggers'
saws, wooden wheels and snowshoes.</p>
<p>What's more, the food is very good-try the Jack Daniels porterhouse
-and it's served in a hearty atmosphere that transcends the usual
skier-snowmobiler divisions. 218-388-2214.</p>
