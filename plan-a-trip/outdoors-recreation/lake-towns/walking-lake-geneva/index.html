<h2>On a mansion-lined footpath, walking is a spectator sport.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_geneva_stone_manor.jpg" alt="A speedboat cruises past Lake Geneva's Stone Manor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 1901 Stone Manor is the largest house on Geneva Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There are thousands of lakes in the north woods, but the most famous one
is a stone's throw from Illinois.</p>
<p>Lake Geneva has been the favorite retreat of Chicago folks for 150
years, and everybody who was anybody had a place there: the Wrigleys,
Maytags and Schwinns, but also cartoonists, actors, brewers and
bottle-cap makers.</p>
<p>Geneva will seem citified to people who vacation on woodland lakes.
There's a good reason to go there, though: It's entertaining to gawk
at extreme wealth, and there's no better place to do it than Lake
Geneva.</p>
<p>The rich built fabulous estates along the 20 miles of shoreline —
French chateaus, Tudor lodges, turreted Queen Annes and one Buddhist
temple, formerly the Ceylon pavilion at the 1893 World's Fair.</p>
<p>Many are gone, but many remain, alongside newer homes that are bigger
and more resplendent than the originals.</p>
<p>Lake Geneva was named a Distinctive Destinations by the National Trust
for Historic Preservation, which cited its &quot;historical spectrum of
American residential architecture.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Miraculously, tourists can see the mansions up close from a footpath
used by the Potawatomi and honored by early lakefront landowners.</p>
<p>Today, the rich and poor alike have the right of way on a 2-foot strip
around the lake, and they can ogle all they like.</p>
<p>We walked the path one Memorial Day weekend, starting from Library Park
in the town of Lake Geneva and heading counterclockwise, along the
stretch that was first to be settled.</p>
<p>A few of the houses were close to the water, and we felt like voyeurs
traipsing by owners relaxing or grilling on their patios.</p>
<p>But soon the lawns began unrolling in green carpets, putting the
mansions at a regal remove. We passed estates owned by the Rockefellers,
the Wrigleys and the Swifts.</p>
<p>Even more striking than the buildings were the towering oaks, the
carefully pruned shrubs, the tulips and azaleas and pale-blue clouds of
forget-me-not.</p>
<p>There were gazebos and ornate boathouses and iron bridges with whimsical
dragonflies and ferns worked into their railings.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_geneva_town.jpg" alt="People walking around Geneva Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In the town of Lake Geneva, the footpath is a sidewalk.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At Glen Fern, a 1911 Beaux Arts manor built by a judge, waterfalls
coursed down the hillside, and we stopped to watch a yellow-headed bird
twittering in a sycamore.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of money to be rich, we realized. Many of the docks still
were piled on lawns, massive piles of lumber and steel awaiting the
sturdy marina men and their crane.</p>
<p>The boats were high-maintenance teak and mahogany. The vast lawns were
lush and devoid of dandelions.</p>
<p>In this town, we deduced, it pays to be a marina owner or a gardener.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the path was nothing but grass. But more often, it was slabs
of glowing limestone, or glazed bricks embossed with patterns. A few
times, owners gave us a friendly nod as we walked by.</p>
<p>There are a thousand stories about the people on Geneva Lake. House in
the Woods, intended as a spring birthday present, was built in the
winter of 1905 under a circus tent borrowed from the P.T. Barnum Circus,
wintering in nearby Delavan.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The largest house, the 1901 Stone Manor, was built by Otto Young, a
penniless German immigrant who sold costume jewelry on the streets of
New York but moved to Chicago after the 1871 fire and acquired seemingly
worthless land that now is the Loop.</p>
<p>It'd be fun to own a place here, we thought, if only because then we'd
know all the gossip. It must be fairly juicy; the creators of &quot;The
Young and the Restless&quot; developed the soap opera while living in the
1929 palazzo Casa del Sueño.</p>
<p>We walked another trail in Williams Bay, through the Kishwaukétoe nature
preserve, treading a boardwalk over wetlands thick with wildflowers as a
turkey vulture circled overhead.</p>
<p>We emerged onto a restored prairie, then Highway 67, the main drag
through town.</p>
<p>Following it back to the lakefront, we stopped at the Skagen Hus, a
Scandinavian imports started by John Conlin and his Danish wife,
Marianne. Conlin said the village bought the 230-acre property in 1989
for $1.2 million, finally ending the clamor from developers.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a lot of wrenching of hands and big speeches, but now it
looks like a great deal,&quot; he said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_geneva_sailboat.jpg" alt="A sailboat on Lake Geneva." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Sailboats whip around the lake in warm weather.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's impossible to spend time around Geneva Lake without thinking about
money. Walking by the municipal pier in Fontana, we noticed the steep launch
fees, even for a kayak.</p>
<p>In the town of Lake Geneva, it costs $25 an hour to park a yacht at
pier. People who want to tool around the lake in a rented motorboat pay
$105 an hour, and sunbathers pay $7 to use Riviera Beach.</p>
<p>People-watching is free, though, and since the tourists buzzing around
Lake Geneva's waterfront reflect the diversity of Chicago, it was
top-notch. We also enjoyed the two-hour Full Lake Tour from Geneva
Cruise Lines.</p>
<p>It's a good way to find out more about the houses and the people who
lived in them, and as the Walworth headed down the lake, we listened
intently to the narration.</p>
<p>The women sitting in front of us were too young to care that the 1930s
radio show &quot;Amos and Andy&quot; was broadcast from the porch of one home,
and they were bored before we reached Williams Bay.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, look, another big house,&quot; one said sarcastically. &quot;I don't
know those people.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, it gets kind of old after a while,&quot; her friend replied.</p>
<p>Besides mansions, there are condo complexes, a country club, a state
park and two youth camps. But we also found one classic 1950s resort in
Williams Bay, with a small beach and a walk lined by tidy cottages, and
when we walked through it, every guest looked very pleased to be there.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Nancy and Jim Maiers have run Chippewa Resort since 1971, and there's
rarely an opening because everybody comes back every year.</p>
<p>&quot;We get approached all the time, 'Can we buy our cabin?' &quot; Nancy
Maiers said. &quot;But there's wonderful camaraderie; people just love each
other, and you can't buy that.&quot;</p>
<p>After Labor Day, things ease up. &quot;September is gorgeous,&quot; Maiers
says.</p>
<p>We heard the same thing while dining at Medusa Grill and Bistro in Lake
Geneva, where we struck up a conversation with Duane and Cheryl Halleck
of Homer Glen, Ill., a Chicago suburb.</p>
<p>The two visit frequently, bringing their dogs and walking around the
lake, watching the landscape change from spring's tulips to summer's
roses and lilies.</p>
<p>&quot;It gets crazy here on the weekends in summer, so we try to come on
weekdays,&quot; Cheryl Halleck said. &quot;And fall is gorgeous.&quot;</p>
<p>Even when it's crazy, though, you have to hand it to Lake Geneva: It's
one of a kind.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Lake Geneva, Wisconsin</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> It's an hour and a half from Chicago and an hour or
less from Madison and Milwaukee.</p>
<p><em>When to go:</em> September is quiet but beautiful. May and June also are
good times to visit. It's quite crowded in July and August and on
October weekends.</p>
<p><em>What to know:</em> Businesses in the entire area say they're in &quot;Lake
Geneva,&quot; but the village of Lake Geneva is just one of three small
towns on Geneva Lake; the others are Fontana and Williams Bay. Nearby
Lake Como also is part of the &quot;Lake Geneva&quot; area.</p>
<p><em>2022 events:</em> Feb. 2-6,
<a href="https://www.visitlakegeneva.com/winterfest/">Winterfest</a> and National
Snow Sculpting Championships. August, <a href="https://www.genevalakeartsfoundation.org/art-in-the-park">Art in the
Park</a>. Aug.
17-21, <a href="http://www.venetianfest.com/">Venetian Festival</a>. October,
Oktoberfest.</p>
<p>In Williams Bay, the <a href="http://musicbythelake.com/s/1512/musicfest/start.aspx">Music by the
Lake</a> series at
George William College of Aurora University runs from late June to
mid-August.</p>
<p><em>Lake cruises:</em> The <a href="http://www.cruiselakegeneva.com">Lake Geneva Cruise
Line</a> gives narrated tours from May
from October, including the one-hour Geneva Bay Tour, two-hour Full Lake
Tour, 2½-hour U.S. Mailboat Tour, 3½-hour Black Point Estate Tour and
brunch, lunch, dinner, music and ice-cream social tours.</p>
<p>Reserve in advance, especially on weekends and holidays.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_geneva_bay.jpg" alt="A pretty bay on Geneva Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Flowering trees line the lake path in spring.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Lake walk:</em> It's 20 miles, depending on the source. We used the guide
&quot;Touring the Geneva Lake Shore Path,&quot; which puts the mileage at 19½.</p>
<p>It says that from Williams Bay, it's a 6½-mile or 13-mile walk back to
Library Park, depending on which way you walk; from Fontana, it's 8¼
miles or 11¼ miles. It's available at local gift shops.</p>
<p>The guide &quot;Walk, Talk and Gawk,&quot; however, puts the distance is 21
miles, and says the walk is 10 miles either way from Fontana.</p>
<p>Lake Geneva Cruise Line advertises <a href="https://www.cruiselakegeneva.com/public-tours/lake-walk-options/">Lake Walk
tours</a>, in which hikers can walk seven to 10 miles around the lake and travel
the rest of the way by boat. Reserve in advance.</p>
<p>Using a stroller would be difficult, and bicycling isn't possible; many
spots require climbing steps or making narrow turns.</p>
<p><em>Canoe and kayak launch:</em> It's free from Chapin Road, but there's no
parking. There are fees from the Fontana launch and the Lake Geneva
pier, a block east of Riviera Beach.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Accommodations:</em> Nearly all the resorts, hotels and inns list their
addresses as Lake Geneva, but the only ones in the town and on the lake
are the <a href="http://www.bellavistasuites.com">Bella Vista Suites</a>, <a href="http://harborshoreslg.com/">Harbor
Shores</a> and, three blocks away on the lake
path, <a href="http://www.lkgeneva.com">Eleven Gables Inn &amp; Cottage</a>, which
welcomes dogs.</p>
<p>The 1856 <a href="http://www.maxwellmansion1856.com">Maxwell Mansion</a> is near
the Baker House, two blocks from the lake near downtown.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://coveoflakegeneva.com/">Cove of Lake Geneva</a> and <a href="http://www.millcreekhotel.com/">Mill Creek
Hotel</a> are just around the corner on
Center Street, between the lakefront and downtown.</p>
<p>A short walk from downtown,
<a href="http://www.sevenoakslakegeneva.com">SevenOaks</a> is a bed-and-breakfast
inn with nine suites, each with a porch, stone fireplace and spa tub, in
seven one-floor buildings.</p>
<p>On the northeast corner of the lake, the modest <a href="https://www.lakegenevamotelwi.com/">Lake Geneva
Motel</a> is just a block from
Lakeshore Drive on Wells Street and walking distance from downtown. It
has tidy rooms and, in summer, small cabins and a small outdoor pool.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the lake in Fontana, <a href="http://www.theabbeyresort.com/">the Abbey
Resort</a> is a sprawling complex with a
large marina that separates it from the lake.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_geneva_boathouse.jpg" alt="An ocean-liner boathouse on Geneva Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A boathouse resembling an ocean liner lies along the lake path.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Not far away, near Big Foot Beach State Park, the <a href="http://www.genevainn.com">Geneva
Inn</a> is a hillside boutique hotel on the lake,
and rates include a breakfast buffet in its Grandview Restaurant.</p>
<p>In Williams Bay, I liked the <a href="http://chippewaresort.webs.com/">Chippewa
Resort</a>, a darling family-run 1950s
resort with a sand beach, a lawn and unbeatable prices. It's hard to
get in, though; proprietors Nancy and Jim Maiers accept reservations on
Feb. 14 for the year, 262-245-9566.</p>
<p>The huge <a href="http://www.grandgeneva.com">Grand Geneva Resort &amp; Spa</a>, which
Hugh Hefner opened in 1968 as the Playboy Club, is on neither Geneva
Lake or Lake Como. It's on a beautifully landscaped acreage just east
of Lake Geneva and has 36 holes of golf, a spa and a large sports club.</p>
<p>Just down the drive, the family-oriented <a href="http://www.timberridgeresort.com/">Timber Ridge
Lodge</a> has an indoor water park.</p>
<p><em>Camping:</em> <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/bigfoot/">Big Foot Beach State
Park</a>, a mile south of
Lake Geneva, is right on the lake, with a quarter-mile sand beach, and
has campsites with showers.</p>
<p><em>Dining:</em> On Main Street, <a href="http://www.soprabistro.com/">Sopra Bistro</a>
is a friendly little places that serves sophisticated and rich versions
of classic dishes and has a nice beer list.</p>
<p>Also on Main Street, the <a href="http://eggharborcafe.com/">Egg Harbor Cafe</a> is
popular for breakfast and lunch.</p>
<p>Just north of downtown on Broad Street, the <a href="https://www.medusagrillandbistro.com/">Medusa Grill and
Bistro</a> serves a Mediterranean
menu.</p>
<p>In Williams Bay, we liked the adorable and friendly <a href="http://www.daddymaxwells.com">Daddy
Maxwell's</a> Antarctic Circle Diner, famous
for its French toast and pancakes.</p>
<p>Most restaurants are priced for the Chicago crowd; those on a budget
will find plenty of places to pick up sandwiches or pizza.</p>
<p><em>Craft beer:</em> In a repurposed church downtown, <a href="http://www.topsyturvybrewery.com/">Topsy Turvy
Brewery</a> serves its own beer and has
a patio.</p>
<p><em>Information:</em> <a href="http://www.lakegenevawi.com">Lake Geneva chamber</a>,
