<h2>In Minnesota's north woods, an old logging town is famous for oversized legends.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/bemidji_bunyan_babe2.jpg" alt="Bemidji's famous Paul Bunyan and Babe." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Every tourist has to stop and take a photo of Paul and Babe.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Bemidji, three faces tell much of the town's story.</p>
<p>Chief Bemidji stands facing the lake the Ojibwe called Bemidgegumaug, or
&quot;river flowing crosswise.&quot; His real name was Shaynowishkung, and he
fed the white people who settled on the lake's shores in 1888.</p>
<p>Their settlement became the first town on the Mississippi, which starts
35 miles away in Itasca State Park, winds north to Bemidji, flows
through its lake and heads east before finally turning south.</p>
<p>The first statues of the chief were wooden, built in 1927 and 1952. In
2015, the city installed a 9-foot bronze that depicted the chief more
realistically-and respectfully.</p>
<p>A stern, square-shouldered Paul Bunyan stands a block away, near the
visitors center.</p>
<p>When he was built for Bemidji's first Winter Carnival in 1937, the
town's lumberjacks were still around, still telling stories of the
logging camps that, not long before, had fed the area's magnificent
white pines into the maw of the sawmill.</p>
<p>The first Babe the Blue Ox was made of canvas and placed over a truck,
whose exhaust pipe was funneled through the nostrils and made Babe's
breaths steam in the cold winter air.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The two were an immediate sensation, earning a page in Life magazine.</p>
<p>The canvas Babe was replaced by a concrete-and-plaster ox in 1939, and
she and Paul sparked a mania for giant mascots that continues today.</p>
<p>As a piece of Americana, they're irresistible. Over the generations,
very few tourists have left Bemidji without a photo of Paul and Babe.</p>
<p>A third giant figure stands across Bemidji Avenue, next to Morell's
Chippewa Trading Post. Known at the shop as &quot;Injun Joe,&quot; he's naked
from the waist up, has a single feather stuck in a headband and raises a
stiff arm in a &quot;How&quot; salute.</p>
<p>With his presence, unwelcome to some in Bemidji, Injun Joe is a remnant
of the historically uneasy relationship between the town and the Ojibwe
residents of the nearby White Earth Reservation.</p>
<p>But now a tree has grown in front of Injun Joe, nearly blotting him from
view. Passersby are drawn instead to the giant metal powwow dancer
across the street, &quot;Niiemii,&quot; Ojibwe for &quot;he dances.&quot;</p>
<p>And downtown, Ojibwe words have sprouted on the doors of shops
-&quot;Boozhoo,&quot; or &quot;Welcome,&quot; and &quot;Biindigen,&quot; or &quot;Come
in.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/bemidji_bunyan_trail.jpg" alt="A bicyclist on the Paul Bunyan Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>For a small town, Bemidji, pop. 13,400, has many layers. One of the last
towns in Minnesota to be settled, it retains a frontier feeling despite
the presence of a university and the main campus of Concordia Language
Villages, which pulls in students, counselors and visitors from around
the world.</p>
<p>It's still a logging town, and the home of many hard-core fishermen and
snowmobilers, but it also has some of the best bicycling and paddling.</p>
<p>In the summer, no matter what the activity, visitors fill their lungs
with the bracing air beloved by generations of windswept North Dakotans
and heat-fleeing Southerners.</p>
<p>On the north end of the lake, Lake Bemidji State Park offers many
naturalist programs, canoe rentals and swimming at a long beach facing
town.</p>
<p>The park also is the northern trailhead of the 115-mile Paul Bunyan
State Trail, which follows the east side of the lake before leading
south.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From Diamond Point Park on the west side of the lake, Bemidji State
University's Outdoor Program Center rents kayaks, canoes, stand-up
paddleboards, sailboats and mountain bikes.</p>
<p>During the long winters-average ice-out on Lake Bemidji is April 26
-the snow-draped forests are threaded with cross-country ski trails,
and there's downhill skiing at the family-run Buena Vista Ski Area,
which straddles the Laurentian Divide.</p>
<p>Bemidji's downtown is a modest collection of brick storefronts that
house coffeehouses, pubs, shops and a theater.</p>
<p>The marquee of the renovated 1918 Chief Theater on Beltrami Avenue
blinks year-round, with concerts, dance and community-theater
performances in winter. In summer, the professional Paul Bunyan
Playhouse presents a slate of musicals and comedies.</p>
<p>The playhouse was started in 1951 by an impresario who brought in a
troupe of New York actors for a season but went broke in a month.</p>
<p>It was long enough to hook Bemidji's citizens, who raised enough money
to pay the actors' room and board while they performed the rest of the
season's plays and to pay for their tickets home.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/bemidji_playhouse2.jpg" alt="Bemidji's Paul Bunyan Playhouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

stages comedies and musicals.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then, the town raised enough to pay for a season the next year, and the
year after that. Now, the Paul Bunyan is Minnesota's oldest
professional summer-stock company.</p>
<p>Through the year, students from the Bemidji State put on plays and
concerts around town. The Prairie-style Headwaters School of Music and
the Arts shows and sells the work of local and regional artists, and
hosts frequent concerts by local performers.</p>
<p>The family-run Bemidji Woolen Mills has been going strong since 1920,
still famous for its plaid Paul Bunyan jackets, ear-flap caps and other
warm items made in the back, where short tours are given on weekdays.</p>
<p>In Bemidji, the old is artfully blended with the new.</p>
