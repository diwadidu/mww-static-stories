<h2>This Minnesota resort town has many lakes and one mysterious stone.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/l/alexandria_ole2.jpg" alt="Big Ole in Alexandria." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Big Ole stands downtown near Fort Alexandria.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There are many colossal lumberjacks, voyageurs and Indian chiefs
scattered around Minnesota, all paying tribute to a colorful past.</p>
<p>But there's only one Big Ole.</p>
<p>He stands at the end of Alexandria's Broadway Street, 28 feet of
glowering Viking, brandishing a spear and clutching a glistening silver
shield that reads &quot;Alexandria, Birthplace of America.&quot;</p>
<p>The past he represents is so fantastical it's been debated for more
than a century. Were Vikings roaming Minnesota 130 years before Columbus
touched land?</p>
<p>The claim is based on a 202-pound stone slab found 23 miles away in
Kensington, wrestled from the roots of an aspen tree in 1898 by a barely
literate Swedish farmer named Olof Ohman.</p>
<p>Scratched into the stone were ancient runes that, depending on the
translation, read, &quot;8 Goths and 22 Northmen are on this acquisition
business from Vinland, far to the west. We had an encampment by shelters
one day's time north from this stone. We were fishing one day. After we
came home I found 10 men red from blood and dead. Hail Mary deliver from
evil.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On the side was a date — 1362 — and hidden within the inscription
were the words, &quot;Eivar composed me.&quot;</p>
<p>Scholars of the time immediately debunked the stone, claiming that
Ohman, who had six weeks of formal education, faked it. So the farmer
took it home and, for six years, used it as a stepping stone outside his
granary.</p>
<p>He certainly never profited from his find. His 16-year-old daughter fled
home to escape the taunts; his son committed suicide.</p>
<p>But in 1907, a visiting amateur historian from Wisconsin's Door County
saw the stone, proclaimed it authentic and spent the rest of his life as
its champion.</p>
<p>Few in academic circles were won over, but thanks to Hjalmar Holand and
a handful of others, the debate continues.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/l/alexandria_runestone.jpg" alt="Copy of the Alexandria runestone." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A replica of the Kensington Runestone is in Runestone Park, east of
Alexandria.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's just as well, because Alexandria is heavily invested in the
legend. Dozens of shops and businesses are named for the Vikings, and
even the schools operate as the Runestone Area Education District.</p>
<p>There's usually a tour bus idling outside the Runestone Museum and
families posing for pictures at Big Ole's mukluk-shod feet.</p>
<p>Alexandria's lakes, however, are the real draw. Two hug the city's
downtown, and seven of Douglas County's largest lakes flank it on three
sides.</p>
<p>In fact, Douglas and adjoining Otter Tail County have Minnesota's
densest concentration of lakes, thanks to vast chunks of ice that
dropped off the last glacier and formed hundreds of lakes amid a rolling
landscape of glacial gravel and sand.</p>
<p>They're deep, clean and usually full of fish, though they're not
wilderness lakes-the pinelands are northward, and prairie begins
just to the west. Farms replaced the hardwood forests long ago, and in
the outlying areas, grain elevators often occupy the same block as
resorts.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>And they're just two hours from the Twin Cities via interstate, making
Alexandria's lakes the closest for most big-city dwellers.</p>
<p>Tourists have reveled in these lakes since the late 1870s, when the
railroads pushed through to the wheat fields of the Red River Valley.
The Hotel Alexandria opened on Lake Geneva in 1883, one of the first
resort hotels north of the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>In the following decade, cottages were built by well-to-do outing clubs
from Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Paul, Kansas City and Monmouth, Ill.</p>
<p>They sailed and fished, but golf fever took hold early; one of
Alexandria's biggest events, the weeklong Resorters Golf Tournament,
has been held since 1923.</p>
<p>Theater-goers have had a venue on Lake Le Homme Dieu since 1961, when
faculty from St. Cloud University began staging a summer season of
musicals and comedies. The cast stays in large cabins on the theater's
lakeshore site and puts on five plays over six weeks.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/l/alexandria_lake_carlos.jpg" alt="Beach at Lake Carlos State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The beach at Lake Carlos State Park is a popular spot.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At Viking Speedway on the county fairgrounds, NASCAR races draw crowds
on weekends. Junior speed demons hop onto the &quot;Naskarts&quot; at Casey's
Amusement Park, which also has bumper boats and miniature golf.</p>
<p>Life is quieter at Lake Carlos State Park, a 1,210-acre patch of nature
that wraps around the deep lake's northern tip.</p>
<p>Its sandy beach, rimmed by waving reeds, is one of the prettiest in the
area, a fact not lost on the park's campers, who make Lake Carlos the
state's third-busiest camping park.</p>
<p>Hikers can walk along 13 miles of hiking trails through a glacial
moraine of meadows, marshes and forested ridges.</p>
<p>Not far from the western flank of Lake Carlos, the Carlos Creek Winery
invites visitors into the cool of its tasting room and gift shop, where
they can taste a crisp, summery Johannesburg Riesling and a full-bodied
cabernet sauvignon as well as chardonnays, rose and merlot.</p>
<p>Started in 1999, the winery grows many of its own grapes on it acreage,
which includes 7,000 apple trees that produce fruit for sparkling cider
and apple wine.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/l/alexandria_lucy.jpg" alt="Lucy contest at Carlos Creek." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Carlos Creek Winery holds a popular Grape Stomp in September.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The vineyard and grounds are an oasis of order. Picnic tables sit in the
shade of trees; those who bring a picnic can accompany it with a glass
of wine from the tasting room.</p>
<p>Or some wood-fired pizza and a glass of craft beer; the grounds now
include 22 Northmen Brewing Co. Carlos Creek also offers live music
every Saturday.</p>
<p>It's fun to stop at the gift cottages that pop up along the roads that
twist to and around Alexandria's lakes. But the best selection of shops
are right downtown, behind the 1880s brick storefronts and pillared
concrete bank buildings that housed the town's early businesses.</p>
<p>At the end of Broadway, bicycle tourists stream through town on the
55-mile Central Lakes Trail, which connects Alexandria with Fergus Falls
to the west and, to the east, Osakis and the Lake Wobegon Trail.</p>
<p>Downtown, tourists stream into the Runestone Museum, where volunteers
and a video fuel speculation that the Vikings could have made it to
middle America.</p>
<p>What about the blond hair and blue eyes early explorers found among the
Mandan Indians in North Dakota, and the 1440 map of &quot;Vinland&quot; that
showed a corner of northeast America?</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>How about those medieval firesteels and axes also found in Minnesota?
And didn't the Norwegian baron Magnus Erickson commission an expedition
to Greenland from which nine men returned in 1364, two years after the
runestone was supposed to have been written?</p>
<p>Perhaps the most compelling question is, if poor Olof Ohman faked it,
why? And how? &quot;Nobody could believe he'd do such a thing,&quot; intones
the narrator of the video.</p>
<p>There's a replica of a Viking house at the museum, furnished with straw
berths, a loom and sheepskins. Elsewhere, there's a tipi and Indian
gallery, a diorama full of wildlife, and a corner dedicated to golfer
Tom Lehman, who grew up in Alexandria, which locals call Alec.</p>
<p>Outside, there's Fort Alexandria, a village of pioneer buildings-a
schoolhouse, a church, a general store and a shed filled with vintage
tractors, sleighs and boats.</p>
<p>In Alexandria, history covers many bases.</p>
