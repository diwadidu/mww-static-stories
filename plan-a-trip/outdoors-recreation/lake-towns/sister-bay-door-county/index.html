<h2>Near the top of the peninsula, this town snares tourists with its beautiful beach and marina.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/i/sister_bay_beach.jpg" alt="The swimming pier at Sister Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Sister Bay has the largest town beach on the Door Peninsula.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Sister Bay is all about the water. And Swedish pancakes. And goats.</p>
<p>It's a tourist town, with one of its biggest draws the goats grazing on
the roof of Al Johnson's Swedish Restaurant, placed there after a 1969
National Geographic story drew a flood of vacationers.</p>
<p>But Sister Bay also is where the locals go, because not only can you get
ice cream and T-shirts there, but also groceries and socks.</p>
<p>Tourist towns to the south-Egg Harbor, Fish Creek, Ephraim-have
peeled off most travelers by the time the highway reaches Sister Bay. To
the north and east lie vestiges of the old-time Door, in Gills Rock and
Rowleys Bay.</p>
<p>Sister Bay is the last real town, and the one that gives visitors the
best reasons to hang out on the water.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Some tourists don't notice that Door County is made up of a series of
towns. It  can be hard to tell, especially on the Green Bay side of the
peninsula, because of the non-stop stream of ice-cream parlors, wineries
and gift shops.</p>
<p>All of the towns also have lovely beaches and parks. But each town has a
different personality, and each has attractions that set it apart from
the others.</p>
<p>So . . . what makes Sister Bay special?</p>
<h3>The goats</h3>
<p>Like it or not, Sister Bay has become known as &quot;that place with goats
on the roof.&quot; Of course, there's a
<a href="https://aljohnsons.com/goat-cam/">story</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that the late Al Johnson, who founded his restaurant in 1948,
could appreciate a good gag gift. He got one every year on his birthday
from his friend Wink Larson, and one year it was a goat.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/i/sister_bay_mosaic_goat.jpg" alt="A mosaic goat in Sister Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In tribute to the real goats at Al Johnson's, artists have decorated
dozens of goats on a pole.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Oscar the goat went up on the restaurant's sod roof in 1973, tourists
loved him, and the rest is history. Now, there's a goat cam so visitors
can follow the real goats, and art goats that hang from signposts in
summer.</p>
<p>In June, there's a <a href="https://www.sisterbay.com/events/p/sisterbaygoatparade">Goat
Parade</a>. It
ends with a festival next to the restaurant, featuring music, games and
a Swedish pancake-eating contest.</p>
<h3>The waterfront</h3>
<p>Sister Bay's <a href="https://www.sisterbaywi.gov/play/waterfront-park/">Waterfront
Park</a> now is the
largest public waterfront in Door County, with 600 feet of sand beach
plus a playground, swimming/fishing pier and performance stage. There's
also plenty of grassy lawn for families to spread out on.</p>
<p>You can rent sit-on kayaks and paddleboards in the park from <a href="http://www.bayshoreoutfitters.com/locations/sister-bay-waterfront-park/">Bay Shore
Outfitters</a>, whose store is along the highway, and get lessons, too.</p>
<h3>The marina</h3>
<p>Next to the beach, you can buy tickets for a <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/cruises/tall-ship-cruises-door-county/">cruise on a schooner or
launch</a>. The
two-masted schooner <a href="https://www.saildoorcounty.com/">Edith M. Becker</a>
offers two-hour daily sails, and Shoreline Scenic Cruises offers sunset
excursions and daily trips south toward Ephraim and north toward Ellison
Bay.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/i/sister_bay_schooner.jpg" alt="The Edith M. Becker in Door County." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Jon Jarosh/DCVB</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Edith M. Becker sails out of Sister Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>You can also rent pontoon boats, speed boats and jet skis to ride around
the bay and the Sister Islands, for which the town was named.</p>
<h3>The supermarket</h3>
<p>Not every tourist can afford to eat out for every meal. If you're one
of them, you'll find the peninsula's largest grocery store, a Piggly
Wiggly, up the hill from the main drag (turn just before you enter town
from the south).</p>
<p>There are a lot of other shops in the adjacent Country Walk complex,
including a book store. Some are aimed at tourists and some are for
locals.</p>
<p>Sister Bay was the first town on the peninsula to install water and
sewer, cementing its status as a place for year-round residents. The
town also has the largest library.</p>
<h3>The farm market</h3>
<p>Just north of town, <a href="http://www.seaquistorchards.com/">Seaquist's
Orchard</a> is one of the largest in Door
County, and its Farm Market overflows with baked goods, jams, juices,
sauces and a lot of free samples.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>You'll find freshly made doughnuts, cherry cider coolers, berry pies,
chocolate cherry bars and jars of chocolate amaretto sauce with cherries
and pecans. Bring a cooler, if you want to take some home.</p>
<p>Seaquist's holds a Cherry Festival on the last Saturday in July and
Apple Festival on the second Saturday in October.</p>
<p>It's especially fun to visit in fall, when there's a hay-bale maze and
a festival atmosphere.</p>
<h3>The off-road Segway tours</h3>
<p>Most Segway tours poke along on flat, paved city sidewalks that anyone
could walk or bike on any time.</p>
<p>Not <a href="https://www.offroadsegwayadventures.com/">Off Road Segway
Adventures</a>. Their guides
take customers on a narrated tour through the fields, orchards, parks
and headlands around Sister Bay, complete with hills and wildlife.</p>
