<h2>At the northern tip of Wisconsin's kettle moraine, an old resort town still draws a crowd.</h2>

<p>In its entire 150-year history as a resort town, Elkhart Lake rarely has
been a sedate place.</p>
<p>The early resort owners loved entertainment and built opera houses,
dance halls and theaters. Then they put in casinos, and gambling became
so commonplace that placing a bet was like buying an ice-cream cone;
everybody did it.</p>
<p>The town was a little bit Catskills, a little bit Vegas and a lot of
Chicago.</p>
<p>Elkhart Lake is quieter these days. The biggest gamble likely will be
whether the foie-gras agnolotti or chipotle-braised pork cheeks is the
better choice at the village's bistros.</p>
<p>It's still a fast place, though — especially during the Concours
d'Elegance in July, when vintage race cars roar into the village from
Road America.</p>
<p>Two things brought in the colorful characters that shaped the town.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The beautiful lake, for one. The story is that the Potawatomi named it
for its shape, but more likely it was mixed up with nearby
Crystal Lake, which really is shaped like an elk's heart.</p>
<p>Elkhart Lake is the crystalline one, spring-fed and clear. It's a
kettle lake, formed in the depression created by a giant chunk of
glacial ice, and the fourth-deepest natural lake in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>It's also close to the big cities, an hour from Milwaukee and 2½ hours
from Chicago. That's where the money came from.</p>
<p>One of the biggest high rollers was Matheus Gottfried, a millionaire
brewer from Chicago. His 1890 Villa Gottfried was modeled after a castle
on the Rhine and included a zoo, game preserve, theater, floating
pavilion and public horse-racing track.</p>
<p>Otto Osthoff came from Milwaukee. The former Prussian soldier had
managed a brewery and then Schlitz Park, and in 1886, he and his wife
opened Hotel Münsterland.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/elkhart_lake_kayaking.jpg" alt="Kayakers on Elkhart Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>They soon renamed it Otto Osthoff's Hotel, &quot;the Famous Summer Hotel
of the North-West.&quot;</p>
<p>The resort that became Victorian Village and then the Shore Club opened
in 1872, and Siebkens Resort goes back to 1883. Both attracted the
Jewish carriage trade and had social directors, and all of the resorts
offered meals on the American Plan.</p>
<p>In the early days, women and children came for a month or more, while
men commuted from their city jobs on weekends. In the 1920s and '30s,
the resorts attracted the nouveau riche, many of them gangsters and
bootleggers.</p>
<p>But in 1945, the governor decided to crack down on gambling.
Wisconsin's first anti-gambling bill forced the local police to finally
notice the many casinos, and the resorts started to struggle.</p>
<p>Then millionaire sportsman Jim Kimberly, scion of the Kimberly-Clark
paper fortune in Neenah, began looking for a local place to race his
cars.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He and three buddies, including Fred Wacker of the prominent Chicago
family, charted a race circuit on the hilly, winding roads around
Elkhart Lake, where the last glacier had dumped piles of rubble.</p>
<p>The first race in 1950 drew 5,000 spectators. It drew 50,000 the next
year, and 100,000 the year after that.</p>
<p>Racing on public roads in America ended in 1952, but racing returned to
Elkhart Lake in 1955, when the <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/indulgent-retreats/elkhart-lake-racing-roadamerica/">Road America
course</a>
was built. Now, drivers and spectators come from all over to the
&quot;National Park of Speed.&quot;</p>
<p>Of the six Victorian resorts at the turn of the century, three remain,
including the Osthoff.</p>
<p>The Osthoff family ran it until 1955, then sold it to a Chicago couple
who turned it into a theater camp. In 1989, investors bought it and
razed the old buildings.</p>
<p>The sprawling new Osthoff Resort was built in the Victorian style, like
Siebkens and the old Victorian Village.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/elkhart_lake_camp.jpg" alt="A classic resort on Elkhart Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Camp Brosius is a vintage resort on a point.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Together, these lovingly landscaped resorts give the village of less
than 1,000 people an old-fashioned, genteel look.</p>
<p>Until 1970s, none had air conditioning; instead, guests soaked up the
breezes from Lake Michigan, only 13 miles away.</p>
<p>Now, the resorts have air conditioning and every other luxury guests
expect, plus, at the Osthoff, a full-service spa and a cooking school.</p>
<p>They can gaze at the lake from balconies or the many patio and deck
restaurants, and up-close from resort beaches.</p>
<p>A few vestiges of old Elkhart Lake remain. Around a point at the far end
of the lake, there's a lovely collection of vintage cabins and
boathouses on 11 acres.</p>
<p>It's Family Camp Brosius, bought in 1921 by a gymnastics organization
and now owned by Indiana University.</p>

<p>On Sundays, there's a no-wake zone on the whole lake, and dozens of
kayaks and sailboats appear.</p>
<p>Fitness buffs fill the town for its June triathlon, and bicyclists and
hikers come to enjoy the rolling roads and paths in nearby Kettle
Moraine State Forest and on the Ice Age National Scenic Trail.</p>
<p>It's been a while since the idle rich were idle in Elkhart Lake.
There's too much to do.</p>
