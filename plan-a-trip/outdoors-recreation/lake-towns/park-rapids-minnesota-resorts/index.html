<h2>In the heart of Minnesota lakes country, town is a tourist hub.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/a/park_rapids_downtown.jpg" alt="Downtown Park Rapids in Minnesota." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In downtown Park Rapids, cars park parallel in the middle of the street.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Ever since it was settled, Park Rapids has been a crossroads for
tourists.</p>
<p>The trains that hauled out white pine at the turn of the century brought
in summer guests, who were met at the depot by resort owners and taken
to the lakes in wagons.</p>
<p>When highways were built, Park Rapids became the gateway to <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/itasca-park-tips/">Itasca
State Park</a>, 20
miles to the north. After the rail line was abandoned, it became the
western trailhead of the Heartland State Trail, one of the nation's
first paved bicycle trails.</p>
<p>As birding became the nation's fastest-growing pastime, it became the
eastern portal to Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge, where birds from the
prairies mix with those from hardwood and pine forests.</p>
<p>But Park Rapids always has made its living from more than tourism, and
it has an old-fashioned, small-town feel that's appealing.</p>
<p>Cars park in the center of the wide downtown streets, in front of the
confectionery, the movie theater and the MinneSoda Fountain, a longtime
teen hangout that seems frozen in time since the '50s.</p>
<p>On summer Saturdays, tourists pour in on their way to the cabins,
resorts and campgrounds on the lakes that ring Park Rapids.</p>
<p>Two of the largest are potato-shaped Fish Hook Lake and fish hook-shaped
Potato Lake; thanks to a mapmaker's error, their names were switched.</p>
<p>From Fish Hook Lake, the Fish Hook River flows through downtown Park
Rapids, where a lacquer-red footbridge marks a path that leads into
Heartland Park.</p>
<p>That's the beginning of the 48-mile Heartland State Trail, which
connects with the Paul Bunyan and Migizi trails to create a 130-mile
bicycling network.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/a/park_rapids_red_bridge.jpg" alt="The red bridge in Park Rapids." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A red bridge over the Fish Hook River marks the start (or end) of the
Heartland State Trail in Park Rapids.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The Heartland is one of the state's most interesting trails because of
the towns it traverses. Each lays a claim to a record: Dorset claims to
have the world's largest number of restaurants per capita, and Nevis
the world's largest tiger musky.</p>
<p>Akeley is the home of Minnesota's largest Paul Bunyan, and Walker holds
the world's largest eelpout festival.</p>
<p>The county roads that wind around the lakes north of Park Rapids also
are a popular place to ride, and the town's Headwaters 100 Bike Ride
and Race in September, which winds up to Itasca and back through Lake
George, Emmaville, Dorset and Nevis, has become one of the state's most
popular bicycle tours.</p>
<p>But in the summer, Park Rapids has the face of a classic resort town. On
sunny days, the tourists stay near the water, at the area's
exceptionally good selection of family resorts. When the skies are
overcast, they come into town.</p>
<p>Downtown, the traditional fudge shops and souvenir stores have been
augmented in recent years by hipper shops, such as Third Street Market,
a health-food store and cafe, and Bella Caffe, which serves panini.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>These days, vacationers can check their e-mail over a jolt of
espresso-and be back on the lake by mid-morning. Park Rapids is a
nice town-but with so many gorgeous lakes nearby, there's not an
hour to lose.</p>
