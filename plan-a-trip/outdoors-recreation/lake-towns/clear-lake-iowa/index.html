<h2>In a laid-back Iowa beach town, the '50s never ended.</h2>

The Lady of the Lake gives daily cruises around Clear Lake in summer.

<p>In Clear Lake, the spirit of the 1950s didn't die with Buddy Holly.</p>
<p>This northern Iowa lake town, midway between the Twin Cities and Des
Moines, swells with vacationers in summer but retains the laid-back,
carefree air of decades past.</p>
<p>On the shores of the lake, classic cars cruise around pocket-sized City
Park, fuzzy pink dice dangling from mirrors. Every Saturday and Sunday,
the municipal band plays in the bandshell. The Lions Club grills chicken
and sweet corn, and a paddlewheeler takes tourists on cruises.</p>
<p>Why change when you've got a good thing going?</p>
<p>Iowans always have revered this town and its shimmering, 7-mile-long
lake. Its heyday was in the roaring 1920s and '30s, when dance halls
and the Bayside Amusement Park made it the place to be in summer.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In 1948, the Surf Ballroom was built to resemble a beach club, and in
1959, rock pioneer Buddy Holly came to play there.</p>
<p>When Holly's chartered plane crashed in a nearby cornfield after the
concert, the whole world heard about Clear Lake.</p>
<p>The crash killed Holly, Ritchie Valens, J.P. &quot;The Big Bopper&quot;
Richardson and the pilot, and Feb. 3 became known as &quot;the day the music
died,&quot; immortalized in Don McLean's &quot;American Pie.&quot;</p>
<p>Fans still come from around the world to pay tribute, especially on the
anniversary of the crash, when the Surf holds a Winter Dance Party in
honor of Holly's 1959 tour.</p>
<p>The Surf, now a National Historic Landmark, was restored to include palm
trees, ocean murals, wooden booths painted with fish and bubbles and
walls covered with stenciled pineapples. Big-band orchestras play
Sundays and classic-rock bands the rest of the week.</p>
<p>In summer, the action is at City Park and on the lake. The old lakeside
resorts have disappeared, replaced by vacation homes. Tourists stay in
motels and B&amp;Bs or camp at the two state parks.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/l/clear_lake_path.jpg" alt="The Seawall in Clear Lake is a spot to stroll and linger." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Seawall in Clear Lake is a favorite place to stroll and linger.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>McIntosh Woods State Park has two comfy yurts on the lake, and one June,
I rented one. It was the weekend of the Take Me Back music festival in
Clear Lake, and classic-rock bands were playing in City Park.</p>
<p>I bought a grilled-chicken sandwich and got onto the Lady of the Lake
paddlewheeler for an evening cruise.</p>
<p>Spring-fed Clear Lake was scoured out by glaciers, said captain Rodger
Nordman, but it sits above the rest of the countryside, so its shoreline
always is cooled by breezes.</p>
<p>In fact, the water is level with the top of the eight-story Brick &amp; Tile
Building in neighboring Mason City, the town's tallest.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm kind of partial to Clear Lake, so I think everything's downhill
from here,&quot; Nordman joked.</p>
<p>Once, the town end of the lake was lined with hotels, restaurants with
big dance floors, a casino and an amusement park that had a roller
coaster, steam train and wild-animal show.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But the grand hotel burned, twice, and now there's only one hotel, a
modern one with a barnlike annex. The casino site is occupied by condos.</p>
<p>But there's still plenty of green space. At the west end of the lake,
fishermen launch from McIntosh Woods, and when I was there, they were
hauling out walleye until late into the night.</p>
<p>Picnickers, swimmers and boaters go to Clear Lake State Park, which has
a 1938 lodge and is shaded by lots of oak trees. On warm summer
evenings, Nordman says, the water off its long, sandy beach is lined
with hull-to-hull pleasure boats.</p>
<p>The next day, I rode through the parks on my bicycle. Riding the 15
miles around the lake, on a paved trail and marked lanes, is a popular
pastime and a good way to see Clear Lake at the right pace: leisurely.</p>
<p>Few towns take advantage of a lake the way this one does. Everything
faces the water-the silver water tower, the community center, the
pretty but modest yacht club, the park and the patios of the restaurants
across the park.</p>
<p>Main Street ends at the water. It has a lot of gifts and antiques shops,
plus a moviehouse and three pharmacies, one called Corner Drug. Oldies
music is piped over the brick sidewalks, and hanging baskets hang from
lampposts.</p>

Fishermen try to hook walleye in the reeds off McIntosh Woods State
Park.

<p>Volunteers go out in trucks at dawn to water the baskets. I met one of
these do-gooders at the Clear Lake Arts Center, an airy space fashioned
from a squat 1970s bank building.</p>
<p>There, Diane Thompson told me Clear Lake stays busy all year, especially
with ice windsurfing in the winter, but is packed only in summer, when
City Park is a sea of lawn chairs.</p>
<p>&quot;That park gets used a lot,&quot; she said. &quot;That's when it really
feels like a Norman Rockwell town.&quot;</p>
<p>Even on the busiest summer weekends, it's peaceful and genteel, much
like River City in &quot;The Music Man.&quot;</p>
<p>Neighboring Mason City was the setting for Meredith Willson's musical,
an instant hit when it opened on Broadway in 1957, but it's lost its
innocent charm, and Clear Lake hasn't.</p>
<p>Visitors notice right away, says Elaine Ficken, who, with her husband,
Gary, started the town's first bed-and-breakfast, the Larch Pine Inn,
in 1988.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like a different world, and they sense that the minute they get
in town,&quot; she says.</p>
