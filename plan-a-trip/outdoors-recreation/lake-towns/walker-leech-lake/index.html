A giant map of Leech Lakes greets vacationers in Walker.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In 1896, a St. Paul man named J.A. Berkey came to Minnesota's Leech
Lake, threw out his line and reeled in a whole new industry.</p>
<p>&quot;He set up white tents for some men from Kansas City, who fished their
guts out and said, 'We're going back and telling everyone,' &quot; said
Renee Geving, director of the Cass County Museum.</p>
<p>The hook was set. Over the years, Leech Lake's reputation as a fishing
hole grew as big as its muskies, which can be huge.</p>
<p>The town that grew on the shores, however, wasn't called Berkey, or even
McGarry, after the town founder, a resort owner who is credited with
coining the slogan &quot;Land of 10,000 Lakes.&quot;</p>
<p>No, it was called Walker, after lumber baron T.B. Walker, in the hopes
that he'd build his sawmill there. Then Mrs. Walker, shocked by Walker's
many saloons, intervened.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Faced with a choice-jobs or whiskey-the town fathers kept their
saloons but also Walker's name, since they'd already sent in the
incorporation papers.</p>
<p>The mill was built in nearby Akeley, a dry village that didn't stay dry
for long. Akeley boomed-Mrs. Walker having given up trying to
separate lumberjacks from liquor-and the sawmill became one of the
world's largest, spawning the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadside-attractions/paul-bunyan-minnesota/">first written Paul Bunyan
tale</a> and
a fortune that was plowed into a famous Minneapolis art collection.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the town on Leech Lake, Minnesota's third-largest lake, was
left to find its own way in the world.</p>
<p>And it did pretty well. Other sawmills were built, and tourists arrived
by rail, taking excursion steamers to Federal Dam, the Indian agency at
Onigum and Ottertail Point for picnics. Hotels were built, along with
hundreds of small resorts.</p>
<p>Today, fishermen from all over still are fishing their guts out, for
walleye in the spring and fall and for muskie in the summer.</p>
<p>In winter there's eelpout, a notoriously ugly but rather tasty roughfish
that, for 40 years, was hauled out of the lake during International
Eelpout Festival in late February.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/walker_city_park.jpg" alt="Walker's City Park on Leech Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Walker's city park has a beach and boat launch on Leech Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Walker's main street is the haunt of fishermen's wives, as well as
hordes of strolling guests from nearby lake resorts. When the weather
turns bad, Walker shopkeepers gird for an influx that jams the town with
bumper-to-bumper traffic.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's windy or rainy, they're in town,&quot; says Jan Henrikson, whose
candle-scented Northern Exposure gift shop was the first of many shops
that sell upscale accouterments for vacation homes. &quot;You want a couple
of those days every week.&quot;</p>
<p>The shoppers do, too, so they can ponder the Icelandic sweaters at
Lundrigan's, the cookware and lotions at Jenny &amp; Co., the gourmet foods
at Christmas Point.</p>
<p>Once, there was a water slide for children right in town. Then the slide
moved to the horse ranch and wildlife park outside town, where kids
could go on trail rides and pet deer and goats.</p>
<p>Now that's gone, too, turned into the Moondance venue for big music
festivals and softball tournaments.</p>
<p>Walker is more of an adult place now, and often there are many choppers
as children tooling down Minnesota Avenue. And increasingly, there are
bicyclists.</p>
<p>They began trickling into town in 1977, after the opening of the
Heartland State Trail, Minnesota's first paved rail-trail. At heart,
Walker is an ATV and snowmobile town, and its first bike shop closed.</p>
<p>But the bicyclists keep coming. Walker now sits in the middle of 130
miles of paved trails, the longest system in the state. The Heartland
State Trail starts in Park Rapids.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It connects to the Bunyan east of Akeley. The Bunyan heads north to
Walker, then Bemidji.</p>
<p>The Heartland continues north to Cass Lake, where it connects to the
Migizi Trail, a 17-mile loop of paved trail around Pike Bay and the east
side of Cass Lake through Chippewa National Forest.</p>
<p>Walker also is a center for hiking. A long stretch of the North Country
National Scenic Trail runs through Chippewa National Forest south of
town, and it connects with six miles of hiking and cross-country skiing
trails in Shingobee Recreation Area.</p>
<p>Snowmobiling, of course, still is the top winter sport, and in summer,
golfers flock to Tianna County Club, a hilly classic built in 1922, and
to the Longbow Golf Club.</p>
<p>In Walker, there's nearly anything anybody wants to do for fun. Yes,
Akeley got the sawmill and the state's biggest Paul Bunyan. But Walker
got the tourists.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/heartland/index.html">Heartland State
Trail</a> :
There are lots of towns to explore on this 47-mile ride between Park
Rapids to Cass Lake, through Walker. Dorset, an odd little oasis that
has as many restaurants as houses, is a tourist destination. Nevis has
shops, cafes and a city beach on Lake Belle Taine.</p>
<p>Akeley is the home of the state's biggest Paul Bunyan, on whose
outstretched hand people pose for pictures. The nine-mile stretch from
Akeley to Walker passes bogs and lakes.</p>
<p>From Walker, the trail follows the western shore of Leech Lake and
continues to Cass Lake, much of it near the highway but usually shielded
by vegetation. South of Cass Lake, bicyclists can turn onto the Migizi
Trail and ride around Pike Bay through U.S. Forest Service recreation
land.</p>
