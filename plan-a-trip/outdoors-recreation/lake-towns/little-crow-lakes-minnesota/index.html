<h2>West of the Twin Cities, easygoing Spicer and New London make a good beach getaway.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/spicer_volleyball.jpg" alt="Volleyball on Spicer's Saulsbury Beach." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Spicer, there's usually a volleyball game going at Saulsbury Beach
on Green Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's a radical idea, but here goes: In Minnesota, you can go up to the
lake by heading west.</p>
<p>These lakes not only are out west, they're less than two hours from the
Twin Cities, in a pocket of the state many overlook.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a secret to me,&quot; said Michele Stillinger, a former Twin Citian
working as a naturalist at Sibley State Park. &quot;I thought I wouldn't find
anything out here; I was very surprised.&quot;</p>
<p>North of Willmar, a smattering of lakes marks the spot where a lobe of
the Wisconsin Glacier stopped 12,000 years ago, dumping massive blocks
of ice and filling depressions with water.</p>
<p>Today, the resulting lakes and ponds provide habitat for swimmers and
sunbathers, but also for waterfowl and animals; the state park once was
the hunting grounds for Henry Sibley, Minnesota's first governor.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;I see more wildlife out here than I've ever seen,&quot; Stillinger says.
&quot;The deer are just thick, and there are coyotes, foxes, bald eagles and
great songbirds.&quot;</p>
<p>It's not Ely; there might be a little cornfield beyond that beach. There
are houses, not log cabins, and there are no pines at all. What the area
does have is atmosphere.</p>
<p>Somehow, life around these lakes, strung along the meandering course of
the Crow River, has retained the feel of a simpler time — not the
1850s, when the first settlers arrived, but the 1950s, when summer meant
long days of sun, sand and surf music.</p>
<p>On the long, broad beach on Spicer's Green Lake, packs of tanned
teen-agers play volleyball and take turns diving off two rafts.</p>
<p>At Lake Andrew, in Sibley State Park, barefoot children fish for
crappies off the pier, then run into a little stone store for Popsicles.</p>
<p>And Friday nights in New London's Neer Park, a corps of spangled,
sun-bleached young water skiers fly along behind three-engine muscle
boats, accompanied by the lighthearted party music of the '50s and '60s.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_london_waterskiers_pyramid.jpg" alt="Water skiers in New London, Minn." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Little Crow Ski Team performs Friday nights in New London's Neer
Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The Little Crow Water Ski Team puts on quite a show for the adoring
crowds.</p>
<p>Its skiers perform in 20-woman dance lines, do double flips on
6-foot-long jump skis, ski barefoot at 45 miles per hour and build
pyramids that can go up to four tiers and 42 people but are plenty
impressive with fewer.</p>
<p>The show always includes a comedy routine, perhaps built around the
fictional townsfolk of &quot;Crowville,&quot; with Flo the gum-snapping waitress
and clumsy Ole, who blows up a grill.</p>
<p>Hairy-legged &quot;queen candidates&quot; wear taffeta party dresses and then, in
the next act, perform tricks that land many of them jobs skiing at
Disney World or Cypress Gardens.</p>
<p>Here, the skiers go into the crowd after the show, to shake hands and
bashfully accept compliments.</p>
<p>It's a wholesome place. One of the biggest events of the year is the
annual quilt auction at Green Lake Bible Camp, where gospel-singing
counselors serenade the crowds.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>And the fastest way to raise local ire, said Allen Latham, is to
propose a marina on Green Lake, the area's largest and deepest.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't want the type of action you'll see on the St. Croix or Lake
Minnetonka,&quot; said Latham, whose grandfather, John Spicer, founded the
town around the shores of the lake. &quot;Those are held up as an example of
what they don't want. They want to keep it the way it is.&quot;</p>
<p>From 1988 to 2018, Latham preserved his part of the past at the inn he
and his family ran in their ancestral home, an 1893 Queen Anne on the
lake. It became known as Spicer Castle after 1913, when his Aunt Jessie
returned from Europe and had its peaked tower replaced by a crenellated
turret.</p>
<p>The family kept the atmosphere in the house and on the wooded grounds as
close to the original as possible, serving afternoon tea from silver
pots, decorating walls with Uncle Mason's cavalry saber and Aunt Agnes'
paintings, and taking guests for leisurely cruises on the Spicer Castle
Belle.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/i/sibley_tower.jpg" alt="Mount Tom tower at Sibley State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A tower on Mount Tom is the highest point in 50 miles.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But Latham grew older, and younger generations weren't interested in
running the inn.</p>
<p>Before the turn of the century, Green Lake was a busy vacation area.
John Spicer shipped out grain on James J. Hill's railroad, and Hill
shipped in tourists.</p>
<p>Now, it's mostly residential, except for two county parks, and
surrounding lakes also have a mix of homes and a dwindling number of
mom-and-pop resorts.</p>
<p>Sibley State Park includes five of the lakes, including Lake Andrew,
whose sand beach is lined by shaded picnic tables. From the interpretive
center, naturalists lead two to four walks and talks daily, collecting
bugs in wetlands, watching for great blue herons and making crafts with
kids.</p>
<p>A paved, quarter-mile trail from a park road leads to an observation
tower atop Mount Tom, the highest point in 50 miles and once the site of
Dakota powwows.</p>
<p>A longer path also leads to Mount Tom, part of 18 miles of hiking
trails, and there are five miles of paved biking trails, lined with
tree-identification plaques.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>For bicyclists, this area is an unheralded find. Little-used County Road
148, a pleasantly rolling, five-mile stretch through cattail marshes and
fields, has a wide bike lane and connects Sibley State Park with the
little resort town of New London.</p>
<p>New London, home of the Little Crow Water Ski Team, has gifts and
antiques shops as well as a coffeehouse, ice-cream parlor and bakery.</p>
<p>From New London, the paved Glacial Lakes State Trail winds 12 miles
south to Willmar, passing the big, festive beach on Spicer's Green Lake,
and 10 miles north to the county line.</p>
<p>It's a tourist area, but one that is so low-key it almost seems a
rarity.</p>
