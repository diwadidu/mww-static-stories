<h2>The lakes, river and creeks that ring this metropolis are a magnet year-round.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_harriet_sailboats.jpg" alt="Sailboats and canoe on Lake Harriet." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Lake Harriet fills with boats on summer evenings.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Every big city has skyscrapers. Every big city has museums and
monuments. But no other city has as many beautiful lakes and parks
Minneapolis does.</p>
<p>Early in the city's history, when its lakes still were considered
swampy boondocks, city fathers decided to make their shores public
property.</p>
<p>Today, the most expensive homes in the city face the lakes, but the
public-in-line skaters, bicyclists, dog-walkers-owns the
shorelines.</p>
<p>In the summer, everyone who isn't working flocks to the lakes to canoe,
sail, skate, swim and picnic. Concerts are held nearly every evening at
the lovely Lake Harriet bandshell, and neighborhood festivals and
theater performances are held in lakeside parks.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Paved paths-one for walking, one for bicycling and skating-link
the lakes, looping around the four biggest lakes and extending across
the city and up along both sides of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>They're hugely popular with runners and walkers, who can be found on
them all year-round.</p>
<p>These paths now are part of the Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway,
which includes 50 miles of trails.</p>
<p>To make shorter loops, bicyclists can use the Midtown Greenway, which
cuts straight across south Minneapolis. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-minneapolis-grand-rounds/">Biking in
Minneapolis</a>.</p>
<p>The most scenic stretches are in the southern part of the city, between
Lake of the Isles and Bde Maka Ska, Harriet and Nokomis lakes to
Minnehaha Park and up the Mississippi River to the east end of Franklin
Avenue.</p>
<p>This route also is the first 19 miles of the Twin Cities Marathon, held
the first Sunday in October and often called the most beautiful urban
marathon in America.</p>
<p>Bde Maka Ska (pronounced beh-DAY mah-KAH skah) is the former Lake
Calhoun. The Dakota name means White Earth Lake, referring to the light
sand of the beaches. The old name honored South Carolina slaveowner and
slavery advocate John C. Calhoun, who as secretary of war also planned
the Indian Removal Act of 1830.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_harriet_bandshell.jpg" alt="The bandshell at Lake Harriet." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Lake Harriet, there are free concerts nearly every day in summer.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Lake of the Isles can be found at the west end of Franklin Avenue. The
most baronial houses are found here, along with the most geese and other
wildlife; there are no beaches, but two islands serve as wildlife
refuges, and there's an ice rink in winter.</p>
<p>Canoeists can put in on Lake of the Isles and navigate a shady little
canal to Cedar Lake, which has beaches on three sides.</p>
<p>On the east side, East Cedar Lake/Hidden Beach is three blocks from the
big Victorian known as the Mary Tyler Moore house, on the southwest
corner of Kenwood Parkway and West 21st Street.</p>
<p>Lake Street passes between Lake of the Isles and Bde Maka Ska and
heralds the Uptown neighborhood, just to the east. Bikes can be rented
here, and every kind of snack found-smoothies, ice cream,
cappuccino.</p>
<p>It's also a shopping and restaurant center, especially for young
people, and it's one of the liveliest neighborhoods in the city both
day and night.</p>
<p>Bde Maka Ska has three beaches and the most open expanses; it's often
used for windsurfing and sailing. It connects to Lake Harriet, the
prettiest and most family-oriented lake; a vintage streetcar also
connects the two lakes.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Around Lake Harriet, the Rose Garden is a favorite spot, as well as the
two beaches, the bandshell and playground just beyond it.</p>
<p>For a pleasant detour, venture two blocks from the western side of Lake
Harriet to the little shops and cafes of the Linden Hills neighborhood,
at the corner of Upton Avenue and West 43rd Street.</p>
<p>Then continue around Lake Harriet to Minnehaha Creek, which the path
follows to Lake Nokomis. This lake has a big, broad beach, with an
up-close view of planes going to and from the airport. Hiawatha Lake, up
and across the parkway, has a smaller beach.</p>
<p>From there, it's not far to Minnehaha Park, whose thundering falls have
been a tourist attraction since the city's birth. Footpaths wind
through the gorge at the foot of the falls, following the creek to its
meeting with the Mississippi.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minnehaha_falls.jpg" alt="Minnehaha Falls in Minneapolis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Minnehaha Falls is the centerpiece of Minnehaha Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The path continues along the river, as it flows upstream to the falls of
St. Anthony. The campus of the University of Minnesota straddles the
river north of the Franklin Bridge; the Weisman Art Museum, a fractured
silver pile on the east side of the river, is worth a stop.</p>
<p>From there, it's not far to James J. Hill's Stone Arch Bridge, where
the city started.</p>
<p>For more about the Stone Arch Bridge and St. Anthony Main area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/minneapolis-riverfront/">On
the river in
Minneapolis</a>.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Chain of Lakes in Minneapolis</h3>
<p><em>Touring</em> : On weekends, the paths can get crowded. Bicycle paths are
one-way, which cuts down on congestion.</p>
<p>For more about bicycling in and from the city, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/grand-rounds/">Biking in
Minneapolis</a>.</p>
<p><em>Bike rental</em> : In Minnehaha Park, <a href="http://www.wheelfunrentals.com/listlocations/50">Wheel
Fun</a> rents bicycles and
surreys.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.niceridemn.org/">Nice Ride Minnesota</a> has bikes at many
stations throughout Minneapolis including Uptown, near Lake of the Isles
and Bde Maka Ska.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_calhoun_walk.jpg" alt="People walking around Lake Calhoun." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p><strong><a href="https://www.minneapolisparks.org/rentals__permits/watercraft_storage__rentals/boat_rentals/">Boat
rentals</a></strong>
: Canoes, kayaks and paddleboats are available at Bde Maka Ska and Lake
Harriet and canoes at Lake Nokomis.</p>
<p><em>Canoeing</em> <em>and kayaking</em> : The paddle from Bde Maka Ska to Lake of the
Isles, Cedar Lake and Brownie Lake is very popular.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.minneapolisparks.org/activities__events/water_activities/beaches/">Beaches</a></strong>
: The Grand Rounds connects the beaches on Nokomis, Harriet, Maka
Ska and Cedar lakes. The larger main Nokomis beach has a floating
swimming dock, large fee parking area and basic concessions; there's a
smaller beach on the other side of the lake that has no lifeguard or
bathhouse.</p>
<p>Lake Harriet has two small family beaches, one not far from the
bandshell, playground and concessions at Bread &amp; Pickle. There's a fee
parking lot that often fills.</p>
<p>Bde Maka Ska is more open and attracts singles from the Uptown area. On
the south end of the lake, Thomas Beach has a floating swimming dock and
sand-volleyball courts. There's a small fee parking lot.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On the north end, there's a canoe and kayak rental and concession at
Tin Fish, flanked by North Beach and 32nd Beach. It's hard to find
parking.</p>
<p>Cedar is the quietest lake. East Cedar Beach, reached through the
Kenwood neighborhood, has been known as Hidden Beach; it's not too hard
to find parking on nearby streets. Cedar Point and Cedar South beaches
have a few free parking spots.</p>
<p>Lifeguard schedules vary.</p>
<p>There's also a beach on Lake Hiawatha, near Lake Nokomis, and Wirth
Lake, north of Cedar Lake on the Grand Rounds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.minneapolisparks.org/activities__events/music__movies/#%21music"><strong>Free
concerts</strong></a>
: Free concerts are given nearly every summer evening at the Lake
Harriet bandshell, usually at 7:30 p.m. and on Sundays at 2 and 5:30
p.m.</p>
<p>In Minnehaha Park, free concerts are at 7 p.m. Wednesdays through
Fridays, and there's a bluegrass festival on Labor Day.</p>
