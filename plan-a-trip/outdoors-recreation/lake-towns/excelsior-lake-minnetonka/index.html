<h2>On the Twin Cities' fringe, a historic lake-resort town still draws day-trippers.</h2>

The steamboat Minnehaha was scuttled in 1926 after two decades of
service, then rescued, restored and returned to service.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the western fringes of the Twin Cities, the wealthy have staked out
Lake Minnetonka.</p>
<p>Nearly all of its 125 miles of shoreline are privately owned, and the
summer cottages built by vacationing flour millers and businessmen —
Pillsbury, Northrop, Bell, Loring, Peavey — have morphed into
mansions.</p>
<p>But on the southeast corner of the sprawling lake, one town retains
vestiges of the Victorian age, when steamboats ferried vacationers
around the lake and day-trippers arrived on electric streetcars.</p>
<p>Excelsior was the last stop of the St. Paul &amp; Minneapolis Suburban
Electric Railway, and people came to have fun: gambling in the casino,
dancing in the pavilion and picnicking on the Commons, where children
rode water toboggans into the lake.</p>
<p>The casino is gone, but Excelsior Commons still is the best public place
on the lake, with sand beach, baseball diamond and a bandshell where the
Minnesota Orchestra plays on the Fourth of July.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>After lying on the bottom of the lake for more than 50 years, the 1906
steamboat Minnehaha rose to take tourists on excursions and to Wayzata
for free Wednesday-night concerts.</p>
<p>The 1896 Excelsior Streetcar runs up and down Water Street from Lyman
Park.</p>
<p>In the little downtown, bistros, boutiques and a salon spa bring in
well-heeled shoppers, but Excelsior still feels like a small town.</p>
<p>Until 1822, only the Dakota knew about this big lake. Then, the
14-year-old son of the Fort Snelling commander and a runaway drummer boy
paddled a canoe up Minnehaha Creek and right into Gray's Bay. They were
the vanguard of a wave of tourists that never stopped.</p>
<p>Stagecoaches began to run from St. Anthony Falls in 1855 and were met by
the first ferry boats. Trains reached the lake in 1867; one left St.
Paul at 4:30 a.m., carrying sportsmen who wanted to hunt and fish &quot;in
the wilds of Minneapolis.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/x/excelsior_conductor.jpg" alt="A conductor on the Minnehaha." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>In 1882, James J. Hill built the grand Lafayette Hotel and ran his
railroad to its door. Wealthy Southerners flocked to the lake to escape
the summer heat, settling into big resort hotels.</p>
<p>By the turn of the century, the rich had begun to vacation elsewhere.</p>
<p>Day-trippers, however, had begun to come by the thousands on streetcars,
which connected to passenger steamboats that ferried them around the
lake and to Big Island, where an amusement park operated from 1907 to
1911.</p>
<p>After 1925, they came to ride the roller coaster at the new Excelsior
Amusement Park. In the 1940s and '50s, thousands went there to see Miss
Minnesota pageants, and in 1962, the Beach Boys drew huge crowds.</p>
<p>In 1964, the Rolling Stones made their Minnesota debut in the park's
Danceland ballroom, though they drew only 283 people.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then, in 1973, the amusement park and the street-car line closed.
Automobiles took the place of streetcars, and sprawling suburbia began
to surround Excelsior, pop. 2,400.</p>
<p>But in 1980, the steamboat Minnehaha was raised from the lake near Big
Island, where it was scuttled in 1926, restored by Minnesota
Transportation Museum volunteers and finally returned to service in
1996.</p>
<p>The boat lost its dock space in 2019 and is looking for a new launch site.</p>
<p>When they're not working on the boat's finicky boiler, volunteers chat with
passengers, telling the story of the lake and the boat and pointing out
big houses built by famous people, among them railroad baron James J.
Hill.</p>
<p>Hill, who built the biggest house in St. Paul as well as the biggest
hotel on Lake Minnetonka, had a love-hate relationship with Wayzata,
which wanted the right-of-way to the lake.</p>
<p>During a 15-year feud, he moved the rail depot outside village limits,
saying, &quot;Let them walk a mile for the next 20 years.&quot;</p>
<p>The townspeople had their own saying: &quot;Twixt hill and hell, there's
just one letter; were Hill in Hell, we'd feel much better.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/x/excelsior_downtown_shops.jpg" alt="Shopping in downtown Excelsior." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The brick storefronts of Water Street are filled with boutiques.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But in 1906, Hill built a better depot downtown, and now, the town
celebrates J.J. Hill Days every September. The Minnehaha docked in front
of the depot, from which passengers can walk to the shops of Wayzata,
Excelsior's one-time rival.</p>
<p>Railroad tracks still separate the town from the water, but the shoppers
along Lake Street have a beautiful view of the lake and passing
sailboats.</p>
<p>Pleasant as Wayzata is, however, it still feels like a suburb. Only
Excelsior, somehow, has retained the feel of a small town.</p>
<p>It's still a tourist destination. Weekenders can stay in an 1858
rooming house, now a handsome inn. The Old Log Theater, founded in 1940
and the nation's oldest continuously operating professional theater,
puts on seven shows a week at its log complex near downtown.</p>
<p>Known for screwball comedy, its alumni include Nick Nolte and Loni
Anderson, whose photos adorn the lobby walls.</p>
<p>Mick Jagger also makes a cameo in town history. According to local lore,
one of the Rolling Stones' most famous songs was conceived in Excelsior
in 1964.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Jagger was at the soda fountain of Bacon Drugstore, the story goes, and
couldn't get a drink made the way he wanted. Local character Jimmy
Hutmaker, known as Mr. Jimmy, was next to him and said, &quot;You know, you
can't always get what you want.&quot;</p>
<p>In summer, visitors easily can spend a whole day riding the Minnehaha
and hanging out on Excelsior Commons, which has a nice sand beach,
tennis courts, baseball diamond and bandshell.</p>
<p>The 15½-mile Lake Minnetonka Regional bicycle trail goes
right through town and connects to the trails of Carver Park Reserve,
six miles to the west. Nearly everyone stops for ice cream at Licks, at
the end of Water Street.</p>
<p>Excelsior may be surrounded by suburbia. But it hasn't lost its
character.</p>
