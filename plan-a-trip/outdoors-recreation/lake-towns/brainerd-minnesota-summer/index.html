<h2>Away from the crowds, Minnesota's busiest vacation area can be tranquil.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/nisswa_shoppers_bunyan.jpg" alt="Shoppers stroll down the street in Nisswa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>To hear resort owners in the north woods tell it, Brainerd is the Times
Square of Minnesota.</p>
<p>&quot;It's crazy down there,&quot; they say, shaking their heads. &quot;It's a
zoo. We don't want to be like Brainerd.&quot;</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, people talk the same way about Door County. Those places
are busy, all right. They're busy because plenty of people like that
kind of atmosphere-the restaurants, the golf, the shopping, the
fancy condo resorts.</p>
<p>Over the years, money has changed the Brainerd lakes area. On the bigger
lakes, $2 million cottages have replaced mom-and-pop resorts. Private
jets fly into the Brainerd airport, and limos mix with minivans on
forested county roads.</p>
<p>Go-cart tracks, miniature-golf courses and amusement parks keep children
constantly entertained.</p>
<p>Crowds of 26,000 jam the grandstand at Brainerd International Raceway to
watch drag racing, motocross competitions and muscle-car contests in
which &quot;the bad boyz of the blacktop battle it out.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The Brainerd lakes haven't been a quiet north-woods destination for a
while.</p>
<p>Nearly from the start, they've attracted prominent guests: to Grand
View, built on Gull Lake in 1919, and Breezy Point, which was built in
1922 on Pelican Lake and had a casino gambling operation that drew movie
stars and mobsters.</p>
<p>Many of the more affluent resort guests later built their own cottages
in the area.</p>
<p>In the 1930s, Floyd B. Olson became the first of several Minnesota
governors to build a home on Gull Lake, and it became the most
prestigious address in Minnesota after Lake Minnetonka.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the big resorts began building top-quality, famous-name
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/golfing/brainerd-golf-guide/">golf courses</a> to draw well-heeled
guests from around the nation.</p>
<p>Today, the area has more golf holes than fishing holes-and there are
465 lakes within 25 miles of Brainerd. As greens fees rose-to $100
and more for 18 holes-so did real-estate prices.</p>
<p>But ordinary folks aren't priced out of the Brainerd lakes. And if you
know where to look, there are pockets of serenity. There's a gorgeous
public beach, quiet parks and traditional resorts, even on Gull Lake.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/nisswa_pelican_beach.jpg" alt="The beach on Pelican Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Pelican Lake has one of the few public beaches in the Brainerd-Nisswa
area. It's very shallow and a great place for small children.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;People like to think Brainerd is the Twin Cities of the north, but you
can find the quiet spots,&quot; says Roger Lykins, who has owned and
operated Lykins Pinehurst Resort for more than 30 years. &quot;It ends up
being as secluded as most people want, when they say they want a
secluded vacation.&quot;</p>
<p>Lykins knows he would make much more money selling his Gull Lake
shoreline than operating his nine-cabin resort, shaded by tall Norway
and white pines and huge basswood.</p>
<p>'I think of that every spring, when we're getting ready,&quot; he says.
&quot;But then you get everybody coming back, and we remember why we're
here.&quot;</p>
<p>Nisswa is the center of what most people call  Brainerd, and when I
arrived early one August morning, bicyclists already were gliding by on
the Paul Bunyan State Trail. At 9:45, Marlene Dupree was sweeping the
sidewalk in front of the Totem Pole, beloved purveyor of souvenirs.</p>
<p>By 9:50, traffic had picked up, and customers started to slip into the
store behind Dupree's back. At 9:55, a little boy climbed onto the
mechanical train in front of the store, and his mother plugged it with a
dime.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At 10 a.m., the smell of hot oil wafted over the street, and the man in
the mini-doughnut stand took his first order.</p>
<p>&quot;And they ask what we do all winter,&quot; Dupree said. &quot;We relax!&quot;</p>
<p>A five-minute walk from the Totem Pole, at Eagle's Nest Resort,
4-year-old Megan Carlson had just pulled a crappie out of Lower Cullen
Lake and was showing it off.</p>
<p>&quot;They can catch a fish every 10 minutes,&quot; said her mother, Heidi
Carlson, smiling. She looked around the shady resort. &quot;It's really
quiet, but there's a lot of action around here.&quot;</p>
<p>From Nisswa, I drove east to Pelican Lake, and after a few wrong turns
found myself looking out on a broad swath of sand. The scarcity of
public beaches in the Brainerd lakes area is odd; even odder, there are
no outdoor public swimming pools.</p>
<p>But this beach-wide, well-maintained, on a clear lake-almost
makes up for it. And only a handful of people were there.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the best beach in the world for kids,&quot; said beach host Chris
Certain, who spends the summer camping at the beach, part of Crow Wing
State Forest. &quot;My boss says you can't drown in it, unless you put
concrete blocks on your feet.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/nisswa_bicyclists_bunyan_trail.jpg" alt="Bicyclists ride through Nisswa on the Paul Bunyan State Trai" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From Pelican Lake, I headed to Breezy Point, a crossroads that is less a
village than Breezy Point Resort, a collection of hotel rooms, condos
and cabins on the northwest corner of the lake.</p>
<p>From there, I hooked onto the 54-mile Paul Bunyan Scenic Byway and
headed toward Crosslake, on the 15-lake Whitefish Chain.</p>
<p>Next to the little downtown, around the mouth of the Pine River on Cross
Lake, the Army Corps of Engineers maintains two small beaches, a boat
launch and a shady campground, as well as the dam.</p>
<p>It's a lovely spot, and a find for vacationers on a budget.</p>
<p>Crosslake can get busy. But the quiet county roads that circle the
Whitefish Chain,
through Manhattan Beach and Ideal Corners, still are lined with resorts
and
supper clubs from the 1920s and '30s, with a languid vacation ambiance
that
has remained unchanged even as the pace quickens.</p>
<p>The next day, I explored two resorts that, for many people, are
synonymous with &quot;Brainerd&quot;; on the far southeast end of Gull Lake,
they're closest to the Baxter-Brainerd strip.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Both started small, but Cragun's and Madden's since have grown into
behemoths, each sprawling along the lake and offering every conceivable
entertainment-magic shows and massage, carnivals and concerts,
nature walks and water-skiing.</p>
<p>Cragun's has an enormous indoor sports center; Madden's has an art
gallery, an ice-cream parlor and a shopping emporium, all linked by
paths that wind past flower beds and fountains.</p>
<p>Each is its own little world, far from reality-which is what most
people want on vacation.</p>
<p>There's a different kind of world just two miles up the road, at the
Gull Lake Recreation Area, and it's no less charming.</p>
<p>Operated by the Army Corps of Engineers, it has a paved bicycle trail,
an oak-shaded picnicking lawn on the lake, a picnic area with playground
on the Gull River, a volleyball court, a fishing pier and walking
trails, plus a beach and campground.</p>
<p>A family could stay busy there, too, for
very little money.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/nisswa_grandview.jpg" alt="Grand View Lodge in Nisswa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Minnesota.

<p>In the Brainerd lakes area, there's room for everyone. People with
money are making the waves, but ordinary folk still can enjoy the water.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Summer in Minnesota's Brainerd Lakes</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : It's 2½ hours from the Twin Cities to the lakes north
of Brainerd.</p>
<p>Brainerd itself is a former railroad town that offers little to
tourists; when most people speak disparagingly about &quot;Brainerd,&quot;
they're talking about Baxter, where strip-style development radiates
from the junction of Minnesota 371 and 210.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : If you'd like a quieter atmosphere and lower prices, go
midweek and avoid the week in mid-August when the Hot Rod Association
Nationals fill the area.</p>
<p>Resorts offer good deals from mid-April to mid-June and mid-August to
mid-October.</p>
<p><strong>2022 events</strong> : June 23-25, <a href="http://www.lakesjam.com/">Lakes
Jam</a> music festival at Brainerd International
Raceway. June 25, Dam Days in Pine
River. July 29-Aug. 21, <a href="https://lakesareamusic.org/">Lakes Area Music Festival</a>
in Brainerd. Aug. 24-28, <a href="http://www.lakesbluegrassfestival.com/">Lakes Bluegrass
