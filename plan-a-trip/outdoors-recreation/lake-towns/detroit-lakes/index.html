<p>DETROIT LAKES/Last stop before prairie</p>
<check Kiddieland in Cormorant>
<p>More than any other place in Minnesota, Detroit Lakes looks like a resort town -- vintage 1950.</p>
<p>A city park wraps around the north shore, where a strait once separated Little Detroit Lake and Big Detroit Lake, and a mile-long beach winds down the west shore from the park. Along that idyllic little stretch are all the landmarks of beach life: a dance pavilion; a waterslide; ice-cream shops; a boat-rental hut; a Key West-style bar under a candy-striped tent; and several vintage resorts, including the tiny, red-and-white Fairyland Cottages.</p>
<p>On balmy summer evenings, as teen-agers begin to cruise along West Lake Drive, it�s easy to imagine this town of 7,000 as it was in the 1950s. But there was live music and dancing every night then, and people pouring in from small resorts on the hundreds of nearby lakes, the last before the North Dakota prairie.</p>
<p>Today, people come to Detroit Lakes for many reasons. Birders come because the town sits not only at the edge of the prairie, but also at the edge of the northern pine forest and the eastern hardwood forest. In one day at nearby Tamarac National Wildlife Refuge, a birder can see 150 of the 258 species listed in this unusual area of convergence.</p>
<p>During the town�s annual Festival of Birds in May, birders head in all directions. They�ll go west to Hamden Slough and Felton Prairie, to see loggerhead shrikes, chestnut-collared longspurs and other birds of the Dakotas. They�ll go south to Rothsay, to see the rare prairie chicken, perhaps still showing some of its bizarre courting behavior. And they�ll go east to the 43,000-acre Tamarac and to the bogs, hardwoods and old-growth pines of Itasca State Park.</p>

<p>Golf courses also bring visitors to Detroit Lakes; there are 108 holes within 10 miles, including Fair Hills� Wildflower Course and the championship course at Detroit Country Club, where the Pine to Palm amateur tournament is held in August.</p>
<p>And, also in August, hordes of country-music fans descend on the town of 7,000. WE Fest, held just south of town at Soo Pass Ranch, brings in 50,000 people a day, many in a noticeably festive mood that does not endear them to townspeople.</p>
<p>Detroit Lakes first was a stop for fur traders and settlers. It was a French priest, traveling through with one of the Red River oxcart caravans, who named it for the narrow strait between the lakes, or detroit The town called itself Detroit until 1926, when the inevitable postal mix-ups with its Michigan counterpart forced it to change its name.</p>
<p>It was a logging town until 1917, when the sawmill in nearby Frazee, once the second-largest in the world, was packed up and sent over the prairies to Montana. That was the end of virgin timber in Minnesota. Harvesting of ice from the lakes continued for decades longer, sent by rail from the town�s depot, through which 50 trains a day, including Amtrak, still pass.</p>
<p>All along, the lakes have drawn vacationers. Today, those visitors see a resort town that is not so slick as others, but has a pleasantly low-key quality that�s been lost elsewhere.</p>
