<h2>A fishing mecca in northwoods Wisconsin has become a fashionable place to shop.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/o/boulder_junction_musky.jpg" alt="Muskies in Boulder Junction." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Festival-goers take a break during Musky Jamboree.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In a little village in northern Wisconsin, muskie probably is still
king.</p>
<p>Back in 1971, city boosters got the U.S. Patent Office to make Boulder
Junction the official Musky Capital of the World. After all, the
surrounding two counties have the world's densest concentration of
lakes, and they still yield 4-foot fish.</p>
<p>But times change. Now, this former logging town deep in the middle of
state forest has gained fame as a playground for another kind of trophy
hunter.</p>
<p>In 1990, a shop opened called, appropriately, The Fisherman's Wife. It
was a big success, drawing more than wives, and it was followed by more
shops in more quaint log buildings.</p>
<p>High-end shopping now goes hand in hook with fishing across the resort
areas of both Wisconsin and Minnesota, but in Boulder Junction, the
trend reaches a kind of apex.</p>
<p>Here, shopping is entertainment. When I visited one summer, a couple at
a store called Peeplelures were giggling over ceramic Aladdin's lamps,
kaleidoscopes and a $900 coffee table with mirrors that created a
bottomless effect and lights that could be programmed to blink like a
strobe, marquee or waves.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Proprietor Jane Ervin moved from Madison with her family and was one of
the many residents who had vacationed in Boulder Junction and aspired to
live there permanently.</p>
<p>&quot;It has a real pull,&quot; she said. &quot;I always felt like it was my
emotional home.&quot; As a shopkeeper, she found inspiration in The
Fisherman's Wife: &quot;It's the model after which we're all
striving,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Two doors away, customers were studying the wares in that shop, which
has the air of an old-time country store. Fancy flannel shirts were
stacked in old cabinets, stuffed animals filled a cradle and bath oils
were artfully arranged in a wood-rimmed tin washtub.</p>
<p>An antique Coke machine dispensed bottled pop for a quarter, and popcorn
popped in an old red vendor's cart.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd been coming up to Boulder Junction for 30 years on vacation,&quot;
said owner Pat Rydin, &quot;and when the doctor told my husband to change
his lifestyle, he told me, 'Well, we're moving to Boulder.' I said,
'Then I'll need something to do.' &quot;</p>
<p>The roomy shop, furnished with antiques from their Chicago-area home,
was the result. Then Rydin gave the town something else to look at when
she commissioned a cedar sculpture of Porter &quot;Barefoot&quot; Dean, which
once stood outside the store.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/o/boulder_junction_market.jpg" alt="Market in Boulder Junction." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Market Place is a mainstay downtown.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Dean was a legendary fishing guide in a town where guides were revered,
a colorful and not always couth symbol of old Boulder.</p>
<p>He stopped wearing shoes after an uncomfortable World War II stint on
the hot sands of North Africa, according to the late writer/historian
Tom Hollatz, and he was famous for his story-telling, drinking and
hobnobbing with celebrities.</p>
<p>But, Hollatz added, he was loved for a friendliness that set the tone
for the whole village.</p>
<p>&quot;He was nice to everybody, and if you asked him for a fishing tip,
he'd tell you,&quot; said Hollatz, to whom Dean bequeathed his trusty
knife shortly before his death in 1980. &quot;And he knew more fishing
secrets than anyone . . . he was our Sasquatch, our tourist
attraction.&quot;</p>
<p>Once, bait shops set the tone for commerce along Boulder's main street.
There are still bait shops, including Bill Sherer's We Tie It Fly
Shop.</p>
<p>When I dropped by, Sherer was sitting in the front bay window,
peacefully tying rainbow thread around a tuft of brown chicken-neck
feathers, fluffing them into a collar out of which a half-dozen strands
of glittery pink thread waved.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;This is what we call a no-brainer,&quot; said Sherer, who holds the
world record for walleye caught on a fly rod and was named one of the
nation's top 100 fly-tiers by his peers. &quot;All the materials I use
create movement, to make the fish believe that this bug knows as well as
the fish does that it's lunch.&quot;</p>
<p>There are many more shops in Boulder Junction. Moondeer &amp; Friends
Gallery shows the work of regional and local artists, many of whom open
their studios during the Northwoods Fall Art Tour in October.</p>
<p>A little supermarket in the 1911 hotel, the town's oldest building,
puts out produce in baskets and crates on the sidewalk and provides a
picnic table under the pines next door.</p>
<p>There's also an ice-cream and cappuccino shop, several cafes and two
serious restaurants, the Guide's Inn, on whose walls hang a framed
photo of the French chef Escoffier, and the Outdoorsman, whose menu
contains such items as escargot, gnocchi and risotto.</p>
<p>Pat Rydin calls it &quot;the cutest town in the north woods.&quot; Mostly,
residents are happy that, thanks to the surrounding Northern Highlands
State Forest, tiny Boulder Junction will never be another Minocqua, the
sprawling resort town 15 miles to the south.</p>

Boulder Junction jealously guards its title.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;We're surrounded by state land, so we can't grow,&quot; said Al
Jensen, a town booster I met at the Guide's Inn. &quot;And all the people
who own land, if they sold to McDonald's, they'd be lynched. So we'll
always stay nice and quaint.&quot;</p>
