<h2>Minnesota's big lake is a capital of both walleyes and Ojibwe culture.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/mille_lacs_four_seasons.jpg" alt="Four Seasons Room at Mille Lacs." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At the Mille Lacs Indian Museum, a guide talks about how people got
through winter.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Big Mille Lacs is up north, but it isn't a wilderness lake. It's more
like a big pond, its vast surfaces dotted with powerboats, its depths
thoroughly probed.</p>
<p>A highway rings its 100 miles of shore, the better for boat access. Its
air is laced with the perfume of gasoline, minnows and frying oil; the
lake wouldn't be known as the Walleye Factory if it weren't.</p>
<p>But fishermen arrived only recently. Woodland tribes were the first to
thrive on its shores.</p>
<p>When French explorers arrived, the Dakota were living there; by the
mid-1700s, they had been replaced by the Ojibwe.</p>
<p>The Ojibwe hung onto the land after Europeans arrived, earning
themselves the name &quot;Non-Removables.&quot; Now, they celebrate their
heritage at the splendid Mille Lacs Indian Museum and at the biggest
event of the year, a traditional powwow in August.</p>
<p>Their predecessors, the Dakota, called themselves &quot;the people who live
by the water of the Great Spirit.&quot; French fur traders renamed their
Spirit Lake, calling it Mille Lacs, or 1,000 Lakes, referring to the
whole region.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The French also mistranslated the Spirit Water, or <em>Mde Wakan</em> , that
flowed from the lake, calling it the Rum River.</p>
<p>This Dakota band, the Mdewakanton, fished for walleye and pike, hunted
in the rolling, wooded hills and tapped maples for their sugar.</p>
<p>There was wild rice in the marshes and smaller lakes; when the people
learned to parch green rice for storage, around 800 A.D., they began to
establish year-round villages.</p>
<p>At the largest village, Izatys, explorer Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du
Lhut, planted the French arms in 1679.</p>
<p>The Ojibwe arrived in the 1700s and, according to their oral tradition,
forced the Dakota out of northern Minnesota in an epic 1745 battle. The
Ojibwe spent the next two centuries trying to hang onto the land, as
white loggers and settlers made their own claims.</p>
<p>Today, they share the shoreline with fishermen, who claim their own
spiritual connection to this 20- by 14-mile lake, affectionately known
as the walleye factory.</p>
<p>In the spring and summer, armadas of small boats make the bays look like
the beaches of Normandy. In the winter, more than 5,000 icehouses pop
up, forming a village known as Frostbite Flats.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/a/garrison_walleye.jpg" alt="The walleye in Garrison." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The lakeside walleye in Garrison is 15 feet long.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Here, fishing is a way of life. The shore is lined with giant fiberglass
walleyes, boat launches, ma-and-pa resorts and shacks advertising
Bait-Gas-Grocery — the true essentials of life on Mille Lacs.</p>
<p>Tiny Garrison is the nominal capital, with its motels, restaurants and
15-foot walleye at water's edge.</p>
<p>Ojibwe land starts to the south, past Wigwam Bay. Into the 1950s, local
Ojibwe stationed themselves along the road in summer, making a meager
living by selling handmade baskets, blueberries and souvenirs to
tourists, displaying their wares on lines running between trees.</p>
<p>They're still making a living from tourists, but now their source of
income is the Grand Casino Mille Lacs, which lights the night sky from a
hill above the highway.</p>
<p>The casino, which includes a hotel and restaurants, has earned millions,
which the band has plowed into tribal schools, clinics and roads in the
spirit of <em>shawanima</em> , the common good.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Across the road, Ojibwe culture is splendidly preserved and displayed at
the Mille Lacs Indian Museum, run by the Minnesota Historical Society in
cooperation with the Mille Lacs band.</p>
<p>Ojibwe artisans often work at the museum, demonstrating the arts of
beading, sweetgrass basketry or flute-making. Videos show fancy dancers
at powwows and wild-ricers thwacking the grain into canoes.</p>
<p>A computer that translates English words into the soft, cushioned
syllables of Ojibwe is a huge draw for children, who watch, fascinated,
as it turns &quot;candy&quot; into <em>ziinzibaakewadooz(n)s</em> and &quot;blueberry
pie&quot; into <em>miinan</em> , for blueberries, and another 85 letters that
explain how the pie is made.</p>
<p>But the Four Seasons room is the centerpiece. Life-size figures enact
the seasonal cycle, tapping and stirring syrup over a fire in the spring
sugaring camp and making nets of stinging nettles in the summer fishing
wigwam.</p>
<p>They gathered and parched rice in the fall wild-rice camp, and carved
pipes and mended inside the winter tipi, insulated with cattail mats and
banked in snow and leaves.</p>
<p>Overhead, geese honk and owls call according to the season. Guides, some
of whose relatives were the models for the figures, tell about Ojibwe
innovations, from early wildlife conservation to the first disposable
diapers, lined with dry moss and completely biodegradable.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The museum also includes exquisite examples of Ojibwe artistry —
birchbark tobacco trays, basswood boxes, beaded bandolier bags — many
from the collection of Harry and Jeannette Ayer, who ran a trading post
on the reservation from 1918 to 1959.</p>
<p>Next door, their restored 1925 Trading Post now is the museum gift shop,
with contemporary craftwork for sale.</p>
<p>Three miles farther south on U.S. 169, clusters of campers' tents at
Mille Lacs-Kathio State Park echo the many wigwams that once stood
here.</p>
<p>The park — Kathio is a corrupted version of Izatys — straddles the
Rum River as it begins its twisting run down to the Mississippi, and
remnants of villages from 800 A.D. have been found along Ogechie,
Shakopee and Onamia lakes, through which it runs.</p>
<p>On Ogechie, the park has re-created a palisaded village from traces
found in one place, one of 19 prehistoric sites in the park.</p>
<p>In 1680, Father Louis Hennepin spent six months here with the Dakota,
who found him and members of his expedition while they were camping on
Lake Pepin. He spent the time taking notes for an adventure book, which
became a best-seller in France.</p>

<p>Today, hikers and skiers flock to the state park, Minnesota's
fourth-largest. It has 35 miles of hiking trails, but it really becomes
a playground in winter, when skiers head out on 20 miles of tracked
cross-country trails.</p>
<p>Snowmobilers have 19 miles of groomed track, nearly all at a healthy
remove from the ski trails. There's a popular sledding and tubing hill
just outside the parks trail center, where logs crackle merrily on a
raised round hearth.</p>
<p>Its annual candlelight ski, when volunteers set out more than 400
luminaries along 3¼ miles of trails, is one of the best-attended events
in Minnesota parks. Hundreds of people show up to glide through bogs and
glens, given a fairy-tale aura by the glowing bags.</p>
<p>The 11-mile, paved Soo Line Trail connects Mille Lacs Kathio to Father
Hennepin State Park, just outside the town of Isle on the lake's
southeast corner.</p>
<p>It's a smaller park, but its shady lakefront campsites, within earshot
of the lapping water, are highly prized. Boat access and a long swimming
beach are just steps away.</p>
<p>Isle is at the lake's southeast corner, where another fiberglass
walleye proclaims &quot;The Walleye Capital of the World.&quot; It's a claim
that's not refuted around here.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/father_hennepin/index.html">Father Hennepin State
Park</a></strong>
: This small park occupies a point just west of Isle and has a large
swimming beach, fishing piers, hiking trails and campgrounds.</p>
<p><em>Bicycling</em> : The 11-mile Soo Line Trail cuts through countryside on
Mille Lacs' south shore, between the old depot behind Onamia's Main
Street to the playing field in Isle.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, riders on the adjoining ATV trail spew gravel and rocks,
some of them palm-size, onto the trail.</p>
<p>From Onamia, it's a six-mile ride on County Road 26/27 to Mille
Lacs-Kathio State Park. In Isle, Father Hennepin State Park adjoins the
town, and riders can use its beautiful lakeside trails and beach.</p>
<p><em>Accommodation</em> s: The large <a href="https://www.grandcasinomn.com/lodging/grand-casino-mille-lacs-hotel/">Grand Casino Mille Lacs
Hotel</a>

cabins</a>, one of them handicapped-accessible.</p>
<p>In Garrison, the <a href="http://garrisoninnsuites.com">Garrison Inn &amp; Suites</a>
has an indoor pool.</p>
<p>There are many lakeside resorts. Two of the larger ones that cater to
fishermen and snowmobilers are <a href="http://www.eddysresort.com">Eddy's Lake Mille Lacs
Resort</a>, a half-mile from Kathio, and

rooms, cabins and condos.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.izatys.com">Izatys Golf and Yacht Club</a>, on the south
shore, is centered on two 18-hole golf courses and a full-service
marina. Ask for package specials. There are indoor and outdoor pools and
a supervised children's program.</p>
<p>The best place for families on a budget is <a href="http://www.camponomia.org/">Camp
Onomia</a>, a Lutheran retreat center with an
indoor pool and two saunas that's four miles south of Mille Lacs-Kathio
on Minnesota 26.</p>
<p>It caters to groups and is in high demand for family reunions. But
rooms, all with private bath, may be available to individual families on
weekends. Bedding and towels are not provided but can rented.</p>
