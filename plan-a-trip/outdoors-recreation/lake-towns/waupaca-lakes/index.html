<h2>In a historic Yankee town in central Wisconsin, visitors travel by water and by land.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/waupaca_mill_spring.jpg" alt="A grist mill on the Crystal River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 1855 grist mill on the Crystal River in Little Hope now is used as a

<p>In the middle of Wisconsin, the village of Rural is just far enough off
the beaten path.</p>
<p>Founded by Yankees in the 1850s, it was the halfway point on the Stevens
Point-Berlin trade route and once had a mill, an inn and a dry goods
store.</p>
<p>But when it was bypassed by the railroad in 1870, the village eased into
a slow, genteel decline.</p>
<p>Nearby, the 22 spring-fed lakes of the Waupaca Chain O' Lakes
flourished, drawing big-city vacationers, but Rural stayed a quaint
backwater on the Crystal River.</p>
<p>Then people began restoring the Greek Revival houses that lined the
narrow, twisting river.</p>
<p>Today, Rural is a historic district. Reached only by small county roads
and cloaked by hardwoods, its collection of white-frame, New
England-style houses has the look of a movie set.</p>
<p>&quot;It's one of two intact villages in Wisconsin; it looks just like it did
in 1852,&quot; says Lois Sorenson, who, with her husband, Gene, turned the
1853-54 farmhouse built by Scottish emigrant Andrew Potts into the
Crystal River Inn B&amp;B.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>She and other villagers, she says, cherish the old houses: &quot;If you throw
water on the floor and it doesn't roll downhill, what fun is that?&quot;</p>
<p>In summer and fall, Rural again is a crossroads for travelers. In
specially made small canoes, tourists by the hundreds float from Long
Lake into the shallow but fast-moving Crystal River, often providing
entertainment for the residents of Rural.</p>
<p>&quot;Some of 'em get serious about it, but the canoes don't maneuver as well
as the regular ones,&quot; says Gene Sorenson. &quot;You'll see them jammed up in
the trees or rocks.&quot;</p>
<p>When I was there one May, it was a little early for canoeing-few can
stay dry in the tippy boats-but the bicycling was superb. One of
Wisconsin's Rustic Roads-chosen for their timelessness as well as
beauty-starts in Rural, and another starts a mile to the west.</p>
<p>Rustic Road 24 is so narrow it may as well be a bike path. Going through
a corridor of red pines, it passes Jeanette White's 1854 coach house on
Emmons Creek, with a front-yard flea market of cream separators,
birdhouses and potbellied stoves-&quot;I get one idea, and one thing
leads to another,&quot; White says-and then Pleasant Valley Cemetery.</p>
<p>Drumlins dot the soybean fields; the last glacier reached its
southernmost point here, dumping rubble into oval mounds and creating
kettle lakes that became the Waupaca chain.</p>
<p>Part of the <a href="http://www.iceagetrail.org">Ice Age Trail National Scenic
Trail</a> runs through Hartman Creek State
Park, which includes biking trails and a pretty swimming beach on
Hartman Lake.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/u/rural_crystal_river_inn.jpg" alt="Crystal River Inn in Rural." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Crystal River Inn B&B is on Rustic Road 23 in Rural.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From the park, Rustic Road 23 returns bicyclists to Rural, crossing the
Crystal River on stone bridges.</p>
<p>I branched off on Whispering Pine Road into the heart of the lakes area,
which retains an old-fashioned look.</p>
<p>The Indian Crossing Casino, a bright-white 1920s dance hall with orange
trim, sits on Columbia Lake next to Ding's Dock, from which motorboats
tow canoes to the mouth of the Crystal River.</p>
<p>Cottages and artists' studios line the back lanes into King and past the
lakeside Wisconsin Veteran's Home, built in 1887 for Union veterans.</p>
<p>In the basement, there's a bowling alley designed for veterans in
wheelchairs; on Saturdays, they can watch water-ski shows just outside
on Rainbow Lake.</p>
<p>From King, Smith Road heads past rocky, hardscrabble farms to
Parfreyville, where only a white-frame church and town hall hint at
Yankee roots. Along County Road K in Little Hope, the Red Mill sits
alongside the Crystal River.</p>
<p>The 1855 mill ground grain for more than a century and now houses an
antiques and gift shop.</p>
<p>Its grounds are the big draw: With its wooden covered bridge, flowering
trees, white-steepled chapel, split-timber fence and gazebo, it's a
calendar page come to life.</p>

<p>Wanda Nye of Menomonee Falls, Wis., had been there only a short while
before she decided to fetch her drawing pad and pastels from her car.</p>
<p>&quot;What more could I add?&quot; she said of the tableau before her. &quot;It's
beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>At the height of summer, the lakes area is busy. Still, it's not as busy
as areas that are closer to interstates and big cities. The water still
is lined by the original cottages, not condo resorts, and pontoon boats
far outnumber wave runners.</p>
<p>Eighteen of the lakes are no-wake; water-skiing is allowed on four
lakes, but only in designated lanes and during specified hours.</p>
<p>Tourists can get a good look at the lakes from the decks of the Chief
Waupaca, a real sternwheeler that offers 1½-hour narrated cruises
through eight of the lakes.</p>
<p>When I took a midweek cruise, we could see turtles sunning on rocks and
herons stalking insects. Our young captain took us from Taylor Lake, the
westernmost lake, into Rainbow Lake and past a Jesuit retreat villa on
land bought from Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, whose son was a Jesuit
priest.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The village of King has many roots in the Civil War; it's named for
Charles King, a Milwaukee native who served in the Civil War as a
teenager and spent more than 70 years in uniform, becoming a brigadier
general in World War I.</p>
<p>Civil War encampments often are held on the grounds of the Veterans
Home.</p>
<p>In Sunset Lake, we circled Williams Island, where movie-star swimmer
Esther Williams once owned a cabin, and passed a magnificent stand of
white pine and a sturgeon spawning ground .</p>
<p>The smallest lake, the captain said, used to be called Hog Hole, &quot;for
the monster-size pike that used to fight here like hogs.&quot;</p>
<p>At Lime Kiln Lake, which farmers used to dredge for fertilizer, we had
to turn around at County Road Q. We could see the barnlike Indian
Crossing Casino across the road.</p>
<p>Glenn Miller, Louis Armstrong and the Beach Boys once played there, our
captain said, and bands still play there for dances on summer weekends.</p>
<p>The Waupaca-Rural area today caters to vacationers with modern
expectations. But its connection to the past never has faded.</p>
