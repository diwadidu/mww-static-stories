<h2>Here's where to look for the perfect place on a lake.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/manitowish_voss_bridge.jpg" alt="Bridge at Voss' Birchwood Lodge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A pontoon returns to the dock at Voss' Birchwood Lodge in Manitowish
Waters.

<p>In summer, there's no better vacation than a week at the lake. Lazy
afternoons on the beach, boat rides, marshmallow roasts, catching a
string of sunnies — these are memories families savor for decades.</p>
<p>But if you don't have a family cabin, where do you go?</p>
<p>Wisconsin has more than 15,000 lakes, about the same number as
Minnesota, plus shoreline on two Great Lakes.</p>
<p>Each of its lakes regions has the basics — fishing, boating, golf and
shopping. Beyond that, each is geared to a different kind of vacationer.</p>
<p>Because of the Chicago influence, many vacation areas cater to big-city
tastes, with big condo resorts and lots of amenities. But traditional
mom-and-pop lake resorts are all over-it's just harder to find them.</p>
<p>Here's where to look for the perfect place for you.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The best-known lake-resort area in Wisconsin is <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/">Door
County</a> or, more specifically, the
Door Peninsula on Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>Over the years, it's acquired more and more of the amenities its many
big-city visitors have at home-art galleries, boutiques, bistros,
wineries, theater and classical music.</p>
<p>They draw attention away from the water, but anyone who cares to look
will find plenty of beaches and boating on the peninsula's 250 miles of
shoreline.</p>
<p>There's plenty of waterfront lodgings and still a few classic lake
resorts, including on Europe and Kangaroo lakes.</p>
<p>If you like a place with lots to do, or you're coming with a big group
and you want something for everyone, this is your place.</p>
<p>In the northeast part of the state, the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/minocqua-wisconsin-lake-vacation/">Minocqua</a> area is Wisconsin's
equivalent of Minnesota's Brainerd Lakes.</p>
<p>It's always drawn prominent guests-business tycoons, politicians,
movie stars, gangsters-and it has a busy vacation atmosphere with
lots to do: water-ski shows, lumberjack shows, a wildlife park,
mini-golf.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/cable_garmisch_castle.jpg" alt="The Blarney Castle at Garmisch Resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Many lake resorts have log cabins, but only one a castle cabin &mdash;
Garmisch near Cable.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Modern condo resorts surround the town, but there are many smaller
resorts on surrounding lakes, including historic Coons' Franklin Lodge,
one of the last all-inclusive resorts.</p>
<p>Minocqua also attracts bicyclists and paddlers, who come for the chain
of lakes and Bearskin State Trail.</p>
<p>And campers love Northern Highland-American Legion State Forest. It
takes up most of the forest between Minocqua and the resort town of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/boulder-junction/">Boulder Junction</a>, which wrested the title
Musky Capital of the World from Hayward.</p>
<p>If the Minocqua area is too busy for you, head west to the Ojibwe
cultural capital of <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/lac-du-flambeau-ojibwe-culture/">Lac du
Flambeau</a></strong>
.</p>
<p>Or keep going north on U.S. 51 to <a href="http://www.manitowishwaters.org/">Manitowish
Waters</a>, a sleepy little resort
community that wasn't so sleepy in 1934, when the FBI tried to ambush
John Dillinger and Baby Face Nelson at Little Bohemia.</p>
<p>It still has a few classic resorts, including Voss' Birchwood Lodge,
which also figured in the debacle, part of Wisconsin's extensive
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/gangsters-wisconsin/">gangster
lore</a>.</p>
<p>Keep driving, and you'll reach <a href="http://www.mercerwi.com/">Mercer</a>,
famous for its giant loon and as the gateway of the pristine
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/turtleflambeau/">Turtle-Flambeau Scenic Waters
Area</a>, a wilderness area
for paddlers and fishermen.</p>
<p>Head east from Minocqua and you'll come to <a href="http://www.eagleriver.org/">Eagle
River</a>. The two areas, straddling Vilas and
Oneida counties, have one of the world's densest concentrations of
lakes, more than a thousand per county.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Eagle River calls itself the Snowmobiling Capital of the World and is
best known for its <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/winter-eagle-river/">winter
sports</a>. But it also
has plenty of lake resorts and the lovely <a href="http://www.3eagletrail.com/">Three Eagle
Trail</a>, which links it to <a href="http://www.threelakes.com/">Three
Lakes</a>.</p>
<p>To the south in Oneida County,
<a href="http://www.explorerhinelander.com/">Rhinelander</a> not only has dozens of
lakes (and resorts) but also the Wisconsin River and the wilderness
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/WillowFlow/">Willow Flowage</a>.</p>
<p>In 1912, the Plum Lake Golf Club near <em>Sayner</em> became the first of many
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/golfing/golf-courses-minocqua-wisconsin/">golf courses in the north
woods</a>.</p>
<p>On the other side of Wisconsin's north woods,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/indulgent-retreats/hayward-wisconsin-shops-inns/">Hayward</a>
always has been a lakes destination and drew its share of Chicago
gangsters, most notably Al Capone.</p>
<p>It has many resorts, is known for record muskies from the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/ChippewaFlow/">Chippewa
Flowage</a> and is the
nation's <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/lumberjacks-hayward/">lumberjack
capital</a>.</p>
<p>Along with <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-cable-wisconsin/">Cable</a>, it's
also famous for its cross-country ski culture and for its extensive
network of <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/mountain-biking-cable-hayward/">mountain-biking
trails</a>.</p>
<p>To the north,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/bayfield-summer-wisconsin/">Bayfield</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/madeline-island-wisconsin/">Madeline
Island</a>
are popular destinations on Lake Superior, gateway to the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/apostle-islands-lighthouses/">Apostle
Islands National
Lakeshore</a>.</p>
<p>The woods around the small towns to the south — <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/theater-music/solon-springs/">Solon
Springs</a>,
<a href="http://www.spoonerchamber.org/">Spooner</a>,
<a href="http://visitsiren.com/">Siren</a> — contain many traditional mom-and-pop
resorts and a lot of <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/golfing/golf-hayward-spooner/">bargain courses for
golfers</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minocqua_coons.jpg" alt="Coons' Franklin Lodge near Minocqua." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Minocqua, Coon's Franklin Lodge was built as a hunting and fishing
camp in 1892.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Heading south, we find bigger resorts and lots of attractions, signs of
the big-city influence.</p>
<p>The mammoth vacation area of <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/quiet-wisconsin-dells/">Wisconsin
Dells</a> is
exactly halfway between the Twin Cities and Chicago, making it a very
convenient place for a family reunion.</p>
<p>There are lots of big condo resorts, but very few with classic cabins,
and it only has one lake-Lake Delton, an impoundment of the Wisconsin
River.</p>
<p>Still, it has three dozen <a href="http://www.wisdells.com/wisconsin-dells-hotels/waterfront.cfm">waterfront
lodgings</a>. And of course, there are acres of water in pools and water parks.</p>
<p>From the Dells, the last glacier swung northward toward Door County,
scraping out kettle lakes as it went. <a href="http://visitgreenlake.com">Green
Lake</a> is the state's deepest natural lake,
and an hour to the east, <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/best-elkhart-lake-wisconsin/">Elkhart
Lake</a></strong> is fourth-deepest.</p>
<p>Both towns have small but appealing villages, Green Lake with a
still-operating <a href="http://www.thrasheroperahouse.com/thrasher/">historic opera
house</a> and Elkhart Lake
with fine restaurants and Roadamerica, a world-class <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/indulgent-retreats/elkhart-lake-racing-roadamerica/">car-racing
course</a>.</p>
<p>The mom-and-pop resorts nearly are gone, but both lakes have big new
resorts with spas and conference centers, and Elkhart Lake still has two
grand old resorts from the 1880s. And each is less than three hours from
Chicago.</p>
<p>And what's just an hour and a half from Chicago? <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/walking-lake-geneva/">Lake
Geneva</a>, beloved by Wrigleys and Schwinns and
nearly everyone else from that big city.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/l/flambeau_dillmans_cabin.jpg" alt="Cabin 5 at Dillman's Bay Resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Dillman's Bay Resort near Lac du Flambeau, Cabin 5 housed a fugitive
Baby Face Nelson in 1934.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's just one big resort on Geneva Lake and one mom-and-pop resort
with cabins. But there are many other places that are walking distance
to the municipal beach.</p>
<p>A lot of city folks would love to find a <em>cabin in southeast Wisconsin</em>
, and once, there were quite a few lake resorts, especially on the
kettle lakes around Oconomowoc and Pewaukee.</p>
<p>But their proximity to Milwaukee and Chicago made the land too valuable,
and nearly all were sold to make way for vacation homes. Many can be
rented, so if you're looking for a lake break, try <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/vacation-cottage-house-rentals/">renting a vacation
house</a>.</p>
<h3>More lake resorts</h3>
<p>If you're still looking, go to <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/Resorts_Directory.aspx">Travel Wisconsin's resort
directory</a>,
which shows more than 500 lake resorts if you check the box for &quot;on
water.&quot;</p>
<p>You also can type in an area if you have one in mind. For example, if
you also type in &quot;Hayward&quot; and &quot;within 25 miles,&quot; you'll get 80
resorts.</p>
<p>You also can choose from a menu of amenities you'd like the resort to
have, including &quot;pets welcome.&quot;</p>
