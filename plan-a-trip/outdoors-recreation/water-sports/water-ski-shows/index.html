<h2>Spend a perfect summer evening watching flips, dance lines and pyramids.</h2>

<p>Watch a water-ski show, and you'll want to climb into your Thunderbird
and go get a chocolate malted.</p>
<p>There's something deliciously retro about spending a balmy summer
evening listening to '50s party music and the roar of marine engines as
spangled, sun-bleached teen-agers fly by.</p>
<p>A corny comedy routine is part of the show, but it's the tricks that
keep the crowd enthralled: double flips, dance lines and pyramids that
can go up to five tiers.</p>
<p>Show skiing is most popular in the Upper Midwest. Ralph Samuelson, who
invented water-skiing on Lake Pepin in 1922, was a showman, and Tommy
Bartlett began putting on shows in the Wisconsin Dells in 1952.</p>
<p>Wisconsin has many more show clubs than any other state, and the
Janesville Rock Aqua Jays organized the first national championships in
1975.</p>
<p>The Madison club won that first championship and reigned from 2006 to
2009, until the team from Wonder Lake, Ill., unseated it in 2010. It won
again in 2019.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In 2011, the Rock Aqua Jays took the title from Wonder Lake, kept it
through 2014 and regained it in 2018.</p>
<p>In 2015, the Aquanuts from tiny Twin Lakes, Wis., won the national
title, and Wonder Lake won in 2016. In 2017, the Sarasota Ski-A-Rees
from Florida entered the tournament for the first time since 1998 and
won.</p>
<p>Whether or not they place nationally, every team puts on a fun show.</p>
<p><strong>Before going, check team schedules.</strong> A
team may be away at a tournament or performing at a festival in another
town. Sometimes, heavy rains affect lake levels and force teams to
cancel shows.</p>
<p>In August, as days grow shorter, many teams perform half an hour
earlier. Later in the month, most teams lose some of their stars to
college.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin State/Regional Water Ski Show Tournament is held in July
in Wisconsin Rapids, and the Division 1 National Show Ski Tournament is
held in August, traditionally in Janesville, Wis.</p>
<p>All of the shows are free unless noted, but teams ask for donations to
help pay for gas and costumes. You can also support the teams by buying
concessions.</p>
<p>Some teams have bleachers; to see others, bring a lawn chair or blanket.
Often, the first half-hour of a show is devoted to the junior
development team.</p>
