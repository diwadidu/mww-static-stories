<h2>In this Lake Superior town, rivers are the place to cool off.</h2>

The city's most popular swimming hole is on the Lester River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Duluth, there's water, water everywhere-and nary a place to
swim.</p>
<p>In Lake Superior, anyway. If you try to cool off in the frigid lake,
you'll probably run out immediately, shrieking.</p>
<p>Early tourist brochures touted Duluth as &quot;The Air-Conditioned City,&quot;
and the vast waters of the big lake keep it cool, usually until July.
Then it heats up, and the locals-few of whom have actual air
conditioners-head for water.</p>
<p>People do swim in Lake Superior, mostly children from Park Point beaches
and teens showing off for each other on the concrete &quot;cribs&quot; off
Canal Park.</p>
<p>The rest of us prefer the warmer-yet deliciously cool-waters of
rivers. And because all of the rivers tumble down the hill toward Lake
Superior, they all have little waterfalls you can sit under, for a
Jacuzzi effect.</p>
<p>We're talking rock here, not sand beach, so wear thick-soled water
shoes to protect your feet. Check depths before you jump from cliffs,
and <em>never</em> , <em>ever dive</em> . And be careful of fast currents, especially
after a heavy rain.</p>

<p>Here are my favorite swimming holes in Duluth.</p>
<p><strong>Lester River in <a href="http://www.duluthmn.gov/parks/parks-listing/lester-park/">Lester
Park</a></strong> . This
is the swimming hole of choice for families, especially the big pool
right off Superior Street. There are parking spaces, porta-potties and,
in the park, picnic tables and play equipment.</p>
<p>If you don't like crowds, go in the morning.</p>
<p>A bit farther up the river, there's a smaller pool lined by a rock
cliff from which  teens like to jump. If you want to jump yourself,
watch where they land, because there's a sweet spot and a spot too
close to a rock.</p>
<p>Come earlier in the day and you'll be able to float unmolested, gazing
at blue sky and a beautiful white pine.</p>
<p>Little kids like to slither through two rapids belly-first. Just below
the second rapids, scoot around on your butt and you'll find a
Barcalounger-shaped depression in the smooth, volcanic rock where you
can sit and let the rushing water swirl around you.</p>
<p><strong>Directions</strong> : From Superior Street, turn left at 61st Avenue East and
into the parking lot. It's five miles east of Canal Park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/j/a/jacuzzi_falls.jpg" alt="Soaking at Jacuzzi Falls." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The first of three pools on the Sucker River is known as Jacuzzi Falls.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong>Sucker River on <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/north-shore-scenic-highway/">Old Highway
61</a></strong> . This
river, best known for rainbow and brook trout fishing at its mouth on
Lake Superior, also is great for swimming.</p>
<p>Make your way upstream, under the highway bridge and the high bridge
that carries North Shore Scenic Railroad cars. You'll see a decent pool
right away, but keep going until you see a series of three pools;
there's an overgrown path on the right side of the river.</p>
<p>All North Shore rivers have waterfalls, with pooled water beneath them.
The notable thing about the Sucker is that all three of these pools are
like little round tubs, with rock barriers that prevent swimmers from
being swept downriver (this is not guaranteed during high water).</p>
<p>Float around, let the water crash on your head or get a workout by
paddling against the current. Non-swimmers can lounge on the surrounding
rock or take a nap on the flat rock next to the middle falls, where two
bonus gushers supply lulling white noise.</p>
<p>Farther upstream, there's a broader, shallower pool with a pebble beach
at the mouth of the culvert under the express highway.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong>Directions</strong> : On Old Highway 61, drive past the marked French River
and park in a large but unmarked lot that's two miles past the New
Scenic Cafe. It's 15 miles east of Canal Park.</p>
<p>The <em>French River</em> also has excellent pools, one of which has a rope
swing. It's 12 miles up the shore.</p>
<p><strong>Keene Creek on the Superior Hiking Trail in West Duluth</strong> . These
swimming holes are along my favorite stretch of the Superior Hiking
Trail, but it had never occurred to me to swim in the creek until I saw
a family doing it.</p>
<p>This could be the shadiest and most quiet place to swim in Duluth.
There's a pool under the bridge just off the parking lot, where teens
jump from a cliff. Keep walking till you see the ruins of an old stone
pump house.</p>
<p>A large, tannin-tinted pool is next to the ruins, fed by a waterfall.
There's another pool and waterfall upstream. If you keep walking
upriver, you'll find a pretty, rock-lined spot completely shielded from
the trail.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/e/keene_pond.jpg" alt="Swimming in Keene Creek." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Superior Hiking Trail passes several swimming holes on Keene Creek.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong>Directions</strong> : From Canal Park, take I-35 west to the Central Avenue
exit. Drive up Central and past Grand Avenue to Highland Avenue, which
veers left at a 45-degree angle. Park in the large lot at Highland and
Skyline Parkway and walk east for about five minutes.</p>
<p>And if you hike west of the Highland parking lot for 3.2 miles, you'll
end up in the <em>Kingsbury Creek gorge</em> , where it's fun to clamber up
gigantic slabs of rock.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/superior-hiking-trail-duluth/">Hiking in
Duluth</a>.</p>
<p><em>Miller Creek in West Duluth</em> . This creek runs through Lincoln Park,
and there are nice swimming holes in its upper stretch, where the
Superior Hiking Trail goes through it. But closer to West 3rd Street,
kids love to slide down a part of the stream bed that's smooth rock.</p>
<p><em>Directions</em> : Take the 27th Avenue W. exit from I-35, drive up the hill
to West 3rd Street, turn right, then left onto Lincoln Park Drive.</p>
<p><em>Chester Creek in East Duluth</em> . The trails alongside this creek,
between <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/duluth-skyline-drive/">Skyline Parkway</a>
and Fourth Street, also are part of the Superior Hiking Trail. They're
popular with college students, families and dog walkers.</p>
<p>In fact, the largest pool, just two minutes north of Fourth Street, is
used more by dogs than people. Farther up, there's a pool at the bottom
of a sheer rock cliff, reached by a steep trail from the west side.</p>
<p>Keep going until you see a waterfall and pool next to the trail. The
entire stretch takes only 20 minutes to walk, and if you cross Skyline
Parkway, you'll be in Chester Park, which has a playground and parking area.</p>
<p><em>Directions</em> : From the Rose Garden off London Road, drive up 14th
Avenue East to Fourth Street. The trail starts across from Burrito Union
restaurant.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_amity_creek.jpg" alt="Splashing in Amity Creek." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Kids love to splash in the pools along Amity Creek, along Seven Bridges
Road.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong>Amity Creek on Seven Bridges Road in East Duluth</strong> . This forest-lined
stretch of road, which follows Amity Creek as it plunges toward the
Lester River in Lester Park, is a longtime destination for Duluth
youths.</p>
<p>Near the first bridge is The Deeps, where cliff jumpers launch
themselves into a pool at the base of a waterfall. Don't do that; it's
dangerous.</p>
<p>Instead, go up to the shallower spot just below the sixth bridge. Here,
Amity Creek tumbles into a pool, then down a slide into another pool
that has a little gravel beach.</p>
<p><em>Directions</em> : From Superior Street after 60th Avenue East, turn onto
Occidental Boulevard, which turns into Seven Bridges Road.</p>
<p>Locals discuss their favorite swimming holes on <a href="http://www.perfectduluthday.com/2010/08/10/favorite-duluth-area-swimming-holes/">Perfect Duluth
Day</a>.</p>
<h3>Playing in Lake Superior</h3>
<p>You can always wade in the cold lake, and every once in a while, when
winds blow in a layer of warmer water from the northeast, you can swim
in it comfortably.</p>
<p>Beautiful sand beaches line Park Point, the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/minnesota-wisconsin-points/">10-mile
sandbar</a> that creates
the Twin Ports' harbor, and they're all open to the public. There's
one right over the Aerial Lift Bridge.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/miller_creek_slide.jpg" alt="Sliding down Miller Creek." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Lincoln Park, kids slide down Miller Creek.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But the <a href="http://www.mnbeaches.org/beaches/lksuperior/B003.shtml">main swimming
area</a> is three
miles farther at Park Point Recreation Area, which includes a beach
house, playgrounds, soccer fields, volleyball courts and picnic areas.</p>
<p>Watch for signs that warn of <a href="http://www.seagrant.umn.edu/coastal_communities/rip">rip
currents</a> (look for
warning signs and a red flag).</p>
<p>Not far from Canal Park, there are a couple of shallow coves just off
the Lakewalk near <em>Fitger's</em> , You also can wade off <em>Leif Erikson
Park</em> and at the <em>42nd Avenue Park</em> in the Lakeside neighborhood, near
Lester Park.</p>
<p>The locals' favorite is just beyond Lester Park, <em>Brighton Beach in
Kitchi Gammi Park</em> , on the east edge of town at 63rd Avenue. It has a
half-mile of cobblestone beaches and flat, smooth rhyolite ledges that
are perfect for lounging in the sun.</p>
<p>Be careful when you go into the water, however; the rocks along the
shore are <em>very</em> slippery, and you're likely to fall.</p>
<h3>Swimming on the North Shore</h3>
<p>There are more swimming holes farther up the shore, along the rivers and
in Lake Superior.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/swimming-holes-beaches-duluth-north-shore/">Swimming in
Superior</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-north-shore/">Beaches of the North
Shore</a>.</p>
