<h2>The quiet St. Louis River is a hub for hikers, bikers, paddlers and train buffs.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_view_lift_bridge_bay.jpg" alt="A view of Duluth's Aerial Lift Bridge and St. Louis Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Just before it reaches Lake Superior, the St. Louis River widens into an
estuary.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Once, a wind-whipped sand spit was not the most desirable address in
Duluth.</p>
<p>Today, tourists want to hang out on Canal Park and stay in beach
cottages on Park Point, just beyond the Aerial Lift Bridge. But the
Ojibwe preferred the calmer estuary of the St. Louis River, which flows
into Lake Superior at what today is Duluth-Superior Harbor.</p>
<p>The French explorer Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, for whom the city
was named, didn't waste much time on the lakefront when he arrived in
1679.</p>
<p>Nor did the early fur traders, who hustled straight up the St. Louis,
which, via the little Savanna River, connects Lake Superior to the
Mississippi.</p>
<p>The St. Louis looks sleepy, but it's the largest Lake Superior
tributary in the United States. With Ontario's Nipigon River, it
contributes about one-fourth of the lake's annual water input.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>John Jacob Astor built his fur post next to the Ojibwe village in Fond
du Lac, 20 river miles from the lake, and operated it for three decades,
until 1847. When financier Jay Cooke brought in the first railroad, it
came in along the banks of the St. Louis.</p>
<p>Tourists once came to the St. Louis, too, taking a sidewheeler on Sunday
excursions to Fond du Lac, where a log reproduction of Astor's post was
built in 1935.</p>
<p>But the mills that lined the banks eventually polluted the river, giving
it a stench of boiled cabbage and rotting fish that sent tourists
fleeing. The mills also deposited mercury-laden waste that poisoned the
fish, discouraging fishermen.</p>
<p>Until the Environmental Protection Agency stepped in to clean it up, few
wanted to be close to the St. Louis River.</p>
<p>&quot;Thirty years ago, no one around here would have dreamed of going on
it,&quot; said Dean Wolf, a Carlton native who was fishing from a river cove
as a big whitewater-rafting group went by. &quot;It's super, seeing all the
rafting on the river now.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/bardons_peak_fall.jpg" alt="Bardon's Peak in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Superior Hiking Trail west of Magney-Snively Park includes many
views of the St. Louis estuary.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The 4½-mile section of the river between Scanlon and Carlton, lined with
nine rapids of Class I-IV difficulty, also is favored by kayakers and
canoeists.</p>
<p>Trails and scenic roads follow the St. Louis from the harbor to Jay
Cooke State Park.</p>
<p>The opportunities for recreation are remarkable: Canal Park may have the
party, but the St. Louis River is the place to play.</p>
<p>People can pick up four trails within a block of each other,
at Grand Avenue and 75th Avenue in West Duluth.</p>
<p>The Kingsbury Creek trailhead of the <em>Superior Hiking Trail</em> and the DWP Trail (Duluth, Winnipeg and Pacific Railway) are just behind the Lake Superior Zoo.</p>
<p>The 70-mile <strong>Willard Munger State Trail,</strong>
named for the longtime Duluth legislator who successfully pushed for the
cleanup of the river, starts across the street, behind the Willard Munger Inn.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Its first 15 miles, through rock cuts up to Jay Cooke State Park and
Carlton, are perhaps the most scenic on any Minnesota bicycle trail.</p>
<p>A walking trail also starts behind the Munger Inn. The five-mile <strong>Waabizheshikana</strong>(pronounced waa-bah-zhay-kuh-nuh), formerly
the Western Waterfront Trail, surfaced with
crushed limestone, follows the river's bays past cattail marshes that
are prime habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife.</p>
<p>It is named for the Marten Clan of Ojibwe, which lived here. Even on
weekends, the path is one of the quietest, least-frequented spots in
Duluth.</p>
<p>A block away, volunteer train buffs give rides on the <strong>Lake Superior &amp;
Mississippi Railroad,</strong> which arrived to
huzzahs in 1870: &quot;The lifeless corpse of Duluth . . . touched by the
wand of Jay Cooke, sprang full-armed from the tomb,&quot; said one
legislator at the time.</p>
<p>Only six miles of the line remain, but they're all scenic. Herons rise
from cattail marshes just yards from the tracks, and the train
occasionally has to stop so the fireman can remove ducks and turtles
that have wandered up from the river.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_stlouis_canoeing.jpg" alt="Canoeing on St. Louis Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Canoeists paddle on St. Louis Bay off the Western Waterfront Trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Conductors point out the site of the McDougall shipyard, which made the
S.S. Meteor, now an attraction in Superior, and other whalebacks boats.</p>
<p>There's Morgan Park, the steel-company town that included perhaps the
nation's first strip mall; traces of a giant steel mill, now the site of
a Superfund cleanup; and an old paint factory that now houses luxury
condos.</p>
<p>First, citizens groups and environmentalists successfully fought to
return the river to its natural state.</p>
<p>Once it again became desirable, they had to fend off developers, who
outbid the Nature Conservancy and bought 358-acre Clough Island for
development into a $330 million resort with condominiums and a golf
course.</p>
<p>The 2008 recession intervened with their plans, and two years later, the
Nature Conservancy was able to buy it from the developers.</p>
<p>Kayakers like to paddle in and among the many peninsulas and islands,
which once held speakeasies and stills but now are habitat for wildlife.</p>

<p>The river estuary is the walleye nursery for western Lake Superior, she
says, and the 170,000 sturgeon released into the river over the past
three decades are breeding.</p>
<p>Eagles nest there, and 70 percent of the birds seen in Minnesota come
through Duluth on fall and spring migrations.</p>
<p>Indian Point Campground rents canoes, and there are other access points.
One of them is Chambers Grove Park in Fond du Lac, where Gary-New Duluth
resident Tim Blazevic was hauling out his canoe one Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;My friends say, 'Oh, go to the Boundary Waters,' but I say, 'Why? I get
it right here,' &quot; he said. &quot;You never know what you're going to see,
whether it's your deer, beaver, otter or whatever.&quot;</p>
<p>Fond du Lac, French for &quot;foot of the lake,&quot; is where Daniel Greysolon
negotiated the first short-lived truce between the Ojibwe and Dakota,
and where the first U.S.-Ojibwe treaty was signed in 1826.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Today, the neighborhood is a placid backwater, 14 road miles from
downtown Duluth.</p>
<p>From there, Minnesota 210 twists up to Jay Cooke State Park, donated
from the lands of a man who, according to an exhibit in the park, was &quot;a
rare good guy.&quot;</p>
<p>Here, voyageurs had a grueling seven-mile portage around a lethal
stretch of Class VI falls and through house-sized boulders.</p>
<p>Modern-day visitors, of course, love the dramatic scenery along the
river, lined by tilted slabs of slate and crossed by a suspension
bridge.</p>
<p>This 29-mile stretch of river is a stunner, from the ferocious rapids
upstream to the languid sloughs of the estuary.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Duluth's St. Louis River</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> From the Twin Cities, it's a two-hour drive on I-35 to
Carlton, and another 20 minutes into Duluth.</p>
