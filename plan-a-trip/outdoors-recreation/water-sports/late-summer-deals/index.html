<h2>On Minnesota's Lutsen Mountains, we find a sweet deal in late August.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_alpine_slide.jpg" alt="Riding the Alpine Slide on Lutsen Mountains." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Lutsen Mountains, one ride down the Alpine Slide never is enough.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you're a bargain-hunter — and most Midwesterners are — the best
weeks of summer are in August.</p>
<p>By the second week, football and band practice has started at schools,
and back-to-school sales are in progress. In Minnesota, everyone wants
to go to the State Fair.</p>
<p>Not many people are thinking about vacation — which is precisely why
it's a great time to take one. The weather is still warm and sunny, the
crowds are gone and, best of all, prices drop, usually on the second or
third Sunday.</p>
<p>I first discovered this phenomenon in Door County, which I'd always
heard was hopelessly congested in summer.</p>
<p>But when I went midweek in late August, it was placid as a millpond,
with hoteliers and shopkeepers relishing the brief respite before Labor
Day and the fall-color rush.</p>
<p>And the weather was superb — in fact, late August is the best time to
visit resort areas on Lake Michigan and especially Lake Superior, which
actually is warm enough to swim in around Bayfield and the Apostle
Islands.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Even Minnesota's North Shore is quiet midweek. One August, I took my
kids to Caribou Highlands Lodge at Lutsen Mountains, which must deal not
only with the late-season lull, but with the perception that it's
primarily a ski resort.</p>
<p>The offer was half off a second night or three nights for the price of
two — a bargain, considering what the resort had to offer.</p>
<p>There wasn't a lake, but from our balcony we had a view of the heated
outdoor pool, on beautifully manicured grounds lined with dahlias and
potentilla, and Moose Mountain, the tallest of the Lutsen ski hills.</p>
<p>There were tennis courts, tetherball and a playground and sandbox;
inside, there was another pool, whirlpools, sauna and a ping-pong table,
adjoining a gift shop with a little counter that sold cappuccinos and
baked goods.</p>
<p>A kids' camp, for children 4-10, was included in the rate, as were the
resort activities: crafts, bonfires with s'mores, bingo and ice-cream
socials. The resort also provides shuttles to hiking trails.</p>
<p>&quot;We're thinking there's so much to do we can't ever do it all,&quot; said
Michelle Schutta of Lino Lakes, Minn., whom we met at the pool.</p>
<p>She and her husband, Ross, had gone mountain biking one day while their
two children were in the kids camp, and golfing the next day at
next-door Superior National.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_caribou_highlands.jpg" alt="The pool at Lutsen's Caribou Highlands resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Caribou Highlands Lodge is on a ski mountain, not a lake, so it has a
pool that's especially large.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;This resort, for the kids, you just can't beat it,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The resort also sells discounted daily passes to the Alpine Slide and Mountain
Tram. This is a deal if you've ever ridden the Alpine Slide, because a
single ride down its half-mile concrete chutes is not enough.</p>
<p>In fact, in 20 years of visits to the North Shore, I'd never gotten
enough of that slide, which is expensive when you buy it by the ride.</p>
<p>So the kids and I bought all-day passes, and while we waited for the
slide to open, we got into one of the little red gondola cars of the
Mountain Tram.</p>
<p>Dangling in space, we rode toward Moose Mountain, jerking up steeply at
the summit.</p>
<p>From there, we hiked a mile along the Cliff Trail, picking our way among
rocks and cedar roots in a shady passageway along a sheer cliff.</p>
<p>We came back through a sunny meadow and stopped at the Mountaintop Deli,
whose deck has a sweeping view of Lake Superior, before taking the
gondola back down.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Then we spent two hours making like cannonballs down the Alpine Slide,
flooring our little plastic sleds as we dropped into bone-pounding dips
and throwing our weight as we rounded curves, to maintain maximum speed
while still avoiding the &quot;Lutsen rash&quot; that results when skin meets
concrete.</p>
<p>Riding on the chairlift back up Eagle Mountain, we clucked about the
cautious types we observed below.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it would be much fun if you weren't going at breakneck
speed,&quot; said my teen daughter.</p>
<p>Nine rides turned out to be enough. Then we headed for the pool, where
we played until the sun began to sink behind Moose Mountain, and then it
was time to fix dinner and watch the movie we'd borrowed from the
resort's large video library.</p>
<p>In three days, we never did make it off the mountain, which surprised us
— we love Lake Superior, just a mile down the road. Not every resort
needs a lake; certainly not Caribou Highlands.</p>
<p>Typically, the resort offers three nights for the price of two from
late August through October, except for the third weekend of October, the Minnesota school break.</p>
<p>With deals like that, a resort makes it easy to wring out the last rays
of summer.</p>
