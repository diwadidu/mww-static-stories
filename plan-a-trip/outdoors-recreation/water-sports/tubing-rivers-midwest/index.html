In Ludington State Park, families tube a short stretch of the Sable
River to its mouth on Lake Michigan.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's almost magic, the power of wind and water on a hot day. It's
enough to give you goosebumps.</p>
<p>Tubing Minnesota's Rum River on an oppressively hot afternoon, I was
amazed to see goose flesh rise on my legs when a breeze sprang up and a
cloud crossed the sun. We'd entered a microclimate that seemed to exist
only along the river's surface.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't even feel the heat here,&quot; said my friend Adele. &quot;You'd never
guess it was 95.&quot;</p>
<p>The last time Adele and I went tubing on a lazy river, it was in one of
the Wisconsin Dells' indoor waterparks, in February. This time, it was
July in central Minnesota, and we were tired of the heat, not the cold.</p>
<p>So we hopped in the car and headed north from the Twin Cities on I-35.
In Isanti, the Rum River is 32 river miles from its confluence with the
Mississippi in Anoka and 113 miles from its start in Lake Mille Lacs.</p>
<p>It's a state wild and scenic riverway. South of town, its banks are
lined with trees and its bottom with sand, so it's perfect for tubing.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On warm weekends, Country Camping near Isanti keeps its two vans going
nonstop, shuttling tubes and people to Martin's Landing, from which
they make the two-mile float back to the campground. Usually, it takes
about two hours.</p>
<p>When Adele and I arrived at noon on a Friday, all was quiet at the
campground, and our driver zipped us to the landing as soon as we were
ready.</p>
<p>In early afternoon, we were the only people on the river, which meant we
were able to float right up to three great blue herons and get close-up
views as each lifted itself into the air and flapped languidly away.</p>
<p>We didn't see any of the bald eagles that nest near the river, or the
sandhill cranes that feed in the fields. But the trees were full of
songbirds, breaking the silence with their trills.</p>
<p>The only other wildlife we discerned were the deer flies buzzing around
our heads and the unseen fish that nibbled the tips of our thumbs,
trailing in the water. Since there wasn't much to see, we just lolled
on our tubes, chatted and relaxed.</p>
<p>We did see a knotted swing hanging from a tree, so I took a break from
adulthood and used it to swing as far as I could into the river. Too
soon, we saw the Stop sign marking the takeout, and I literally dug my
heels into the sandy river bottom to slow down.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Finding a river</h3>
<p>The only bad thing about most tubing trips is they don't last long
enough. On a hot summer day, there's almost nothing better.</p>
<p>Weekends bring crowds, many of them drinkers, but usually you can avoid
them by heading out first thing in the morning. The best time to go, of
course, is on weekdays.</p>
<p>The Apple River in western Wisconsin is most famous for tubing, but not
everyone wants to float on a river whose guests are so notorious for bad
behavior they have to be watched from security towers.</p>
<p>Luckily, there are many other tubing rivers. Remember, nearly every
river that can be canoed also can be tubed.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/great-canoeing-rivers/">15 great rivers for
paddling</a> and other <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/">Paddling

<h3>Trip Tips: Tubing on rivers</h3>
<p><em>What to bring</em> : When tubing, wear water shoes as well as hats and
sunblock. Flotation vests — water wings are <em>not</em> adequate — are
necessary for children and a good idea for adults, though most of the
rivers are shallow, especially in late summer.</p>
<p><em>Don't</em> bring anything made of glass.</p>
<p><em>Safety</em> : Before you go, check for water conditions; sections of river
can be closed because of flooding. Outfitters will know if sections are
safe or not.</p>
<p>The biggest danger comes from the root balls of fallen trees, which can
entangle people and puncture tubes.</p>
<p>If the river has a fast current, even a shallow one, wear a life vest.
And stay far away from low dams, which create a current that can pull
people under even if they're wearing life vests.</p>
<p><em>Self-shuttles</em> : It's easiest to go through an outfitter, but it's
also possible to buy your own tube — look at Fleet Farm or Pamida —
and do a self-shuttle on other rivers if public landings and parking
areas are available.</p>
<p>Since most floats are only a few miles long, leave bicycles at the
take-out point and, after floating, use them to ride back to the car.</p>
<p>For some good bicycle-tube possibilities, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-paddling-rail-trails/">10 great places to ride
'n' glide</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/cannon_river_tubing.jpg" alt="Tubing on the Cannon River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Tubers on the Cannon River near Welch, Minn., wave at sweaty bicyclists
on the Cannon Valley Trail. Many shout, "We're cooler than you
are!"
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Self-shuttles also are easy for two or more people with two cars.</p>
<p><em>Reservations</em> : They're usually not necessary, except for large
groups, but it's a good idea to call ahead on weekdays to make sure a
shuttle will be available.</p>
<p>The rivers below are popular for tubing and may get crowded and/or rowdy
on weekends. But nearly any river can be tubed, as long as you can find
a put-in and take-out point. For river maps, contact your local
Department of Natural Resources.</p>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p>For do-it-yourself tubing, download free maps for Minnesota's designated
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/watertrails/index.html">water trails</a>. If
you're not sure whether or not a river is appropriate for tubing, call
the DNR and ask.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/waters/watermgmt_section/wild_scenic/wsrivers/rum.html">Rum
River</a>, Isanti</strong> : In central Minnesota, <a href="https://country-camping.com/">Country
Camping</a> takes people upriver for the
two-mile, two-hour float back to the campground. It's one of the
less-known tubing rivers, so it's quiet on weekdays; weekends are
crowded.</p>
<p>Tanger Outlet Center in North Branch is right on the way and makes a
nice side trip on the way back.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanesboro_tubing.jpg" alt="Tubes on the Root River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
People cool off on the Root River near Lanesboro, Minn.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Root River, Lanesboro</em> : In the southeast corner of Minnesota, the
chilly South Branch of the Root River carves a shady one-mile loop
around downtown Lanesboro that takes 30 to 45 minutes on a tube.</p>
<p>People can ride the rapids through downtown to the County Road 250
bridge and walk back with their tubes on the Root River State Trail to
do it again.</p>
<p>A longer trip takes tubes past the confluence with the warmer North
Branch to the Minnesota 16 access, three to four hours.</p>
<p>It's susceptible to flooding; check conditions before going.</p>
<p>In Lanesboro, <a href="http://lrgeneralstore.net/">Little River General Store</a>
and <a href="https://eagle-cliff.com/outfitting/">Eagle Cliff Campground</a> rent
tubes on the Root River. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/bluff-land/lanesboro-summer-outdoors/">By river and trail in
Lanesboro</a>
&quot;on the river&quot;).</p>
<p><em>Cannon River, Welch</em> : It pays to get to <a href="http://www.welchmillcanoeandtube.com/">Welch Mill
Outfitters</a> early, because it's
only 45 minutes south of the Twin Cities and very popular. On weekdays,
it opens at 10 a.m. and on weekdays at 8 a.m.; floaters are taken toward
Cannon Falls and left to float 3½ to 4½ hours back to Welch.</p>
<p>There's also a one-hour trip.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><em>Zumbro River, Zumbro Falls</em> : The seven-mile stretch from Zumbro Falls
to Hammond in southeast Minnesota bluff country is very scenic, with
limestone cliffs and steep hillsides.</p>
<p>People who show up by 9 a.m. at <a href="http://www.zumbrovalleycanoerental.com/">Zumbro Valley Canoe &amp; Tube
Rental</a> are most likely to see
the many bald eagles that nest in the area, plus herons and turkeys.</p>
<p>Usually, the trip takes three hours, but can take five to six when water
is low. The last tube trip leaves at 2 p.m. The outfitter is in
Sportsmen's Park, across the river from downtown Zumbro Falls,
507-753-2568.</p>

<p><em>Chippewa River, Chippewa Falls</em> : From <a href="http://www.723loop.com/rentals.html">Loopy's Grill and
Saloon</a> on Wisconsin Business 29
just west of Chippewa Falls, floaters are taken upriver and allowed to
float back, a trip that usually is 2½ hours.</p>

<p><strong>Lower Wisconsin River from Prairie du
Sac to Spring Green.</strong> Below the dam in
Prairie du Sac, there's little development on this wide river, and
it's very scenic.</p>
<p>It's popular for paddling, so there are many landings and launches.
When it's low, which is frequently, the river has many sandbars.</p>
<p>Outfitters that rent tubes include the <a href="http://www.wiriverside.com/canoe-tube-kayak.php">Wisconsin Riverside
Resort</a> in Spring
Green.</p>
<p>For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/wisconsin-river-sauk-city-arena-merrimac/">Road trip: Wisconsin
River</a>.</p>
<p><em>Red Cedar River, Menomonie</em> : Just south of Menomonie, the Red Cedar
River is beloved for its easy access and scenery, including canyonlike
walls of gold sand and abundant wildlife.</p>
<p><a href="http://menomoniecamping.com/">Irvington Campground</a> rents tubes and
offers shuttles. Or people can bring their own tubes and leave bikes in
Irvington, floating from Menomonie's Riverside Park and riding back on
the Red Cedar State Trail.</p>
<p>For more on canoeing and bicycling, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/red-cedar-trail-menomonie/">Red Cedar ride 'n'
glide</a>.</p>
<p><em>Namekagon River, Trego</em> : From the village of Trego, just north of
Spooner at the junction of U.S. 53 and U.S. 63 in northwest Wisconsin,
two outfitters take people up the cool, spring-fed Namekagon and let
them float back.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.logcabin-resort.com/">Log Cabin Resort &amp; Campground</a> has a
sandy beach, showers and splash park. <a href="http://www.jackscanoerental.com/tubers.htm">Jack's Canoe
Rental</a> also rents tubes.</p>
<p><em>Crystal River, Waupaca</em> : In this central Wisconsin lakes area,
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Pliskas-Crystal-River-Tubing-Kayak-Trip-241565423260189/">Pliska's</a>
offers tubing trips on the narrow, twisting Crystal River. The river
winds past historic homes, gardens, scenic foot bridges and the village
of Rural, a historic district.</p>
<p>For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/waupaca-lakes/">Waupaca's Chain O'
Lakes</a>.</p>
<p><em>Apple River, Somerset</em> : This river in western Wisconsin, not far from
the Twin Cities, is the best-known tubing river in the region — though
more for drinking, partying and partial nudity than for tubing.</p>
<p>If you're not looking for a &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; atmosphere, go early
in the day or during the week.</p>
<p>Campgrounds near Somerset that rent tubes include <a href="https://tubetheriver.com/">Apple River
Hide-Away</a>, <a href="https://www.floatrite.com/">Float-Rite
Park</a> and <a href="https://www.appleriver.com/">River's
Edge</a>.</p>

<p><em>Sugar River, Albany and Brodhead</em> : On this southern Wisconsin river,
<a href="http://www.sweetminihaha.com/tubing-rates">Sweet Minihaha Campground</a>
rents tubes for a float from Albany back to the campground.</p>
<p>In Albany, <a href="http://sandbtubing.com/">S&amp;B Tubing</a> rents tubes for a
four-mile float toward Brodhead.</p>
<p><em>Pine River, Florence</em> : South of Florence in the remote northeast
corner of the state, the <a href="https://www.milespaddled.com/pine-river-iii-florence-county/">Pine
River</a>
carves such an oxbow that tubers can float for 3.5 miles, then walk 10
minutes back to their starting point.</p>
<h3>Michigan</h3>
<p><strong>Sable River, <a href="http://www.michigandnr.com/parksandtrails/Details.aspx?id=468&amp;type=SPRK">Ludington State
Park</a>,
Ludington</strong> : This short, placid stretch
of river between Hamlin Lake and Lake Michigan is shallow and a favorite
of families, especially those lucky enough to be camping in this very
popular park.</p>
<p>Bring your own tube or buy one at the park. Float to the lake, then
return on the pleasant riverside path.</p>
<p><strong>Platte River,</strong> <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/sleeping-bear-dunes/">Sleeping Bear Dunes
National
Lakeshore</a> near
<em>Empire</em> : This warm, gentle river between Frankfort and Empire is only
two or three feet deep and also perfect for families.</p>
<p>Bring your own tube and float the mile from El Dorado Landing to Platte
River Point near the river's mouth on Lake Michigan, where there's a
grassy picnic area and small dunes that children love to scale and then
run back down into the river. It's an easy walk back.</p>
<p>If you don't have tubes and don't mind paying, <a href="http://www.canoemichigan.com/">Riverside Canoe
Trips</a> rents them.</p>
<p><em>Paw Paw River in Watervliet</em> : In southwest Michigan, <a href="https://pawpawrivercampgroundandcanoes.com/">Paw Paw River
Campground</a> offers all-day
tubing.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_rafting_wolf_river.jpg" alt="Rafters go over rapids on Wolf River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

of rapids.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Iowa</h3>
<p><em>Upper Iowa River, Bluffton</em> : This stretch of river just north of
Decorah, in the northeast corner of the state, looks more like Utah than
Iowa, with its steep bluffs and free-standing rock chimneys.</p>
<p>One of the most picturesque stretches, the five river miles between
Bridge 5 in Chimney Rock Park and Bridge 7 in Bluffton, is a good
candidate for a self-shuttle because it forms two loops separated by
little more than two miles of County Road W20, just west of U.S. 52.</p>
<p>However, there are many outfitters, including <a href="http://www.chimneyrocks.com">Chimney Rock
Campground</a> near Bluffton and <a href="http://offthedriftless.com/tubes-canoes-kayaks/">Off the
Driftless Wellness &amp; Adventure
Company</a> in Decorah.</p>
<p><em>Iowa River, Eldora</em> : In this north-central Iowa town, between I-35 and
Waterloo, <a href="http://www.rock-n-row-adventures.com/Rock-n-Row_site/Tubing_Info..html">Rock-N-Row
Adventures</a>
offers three- to -four-hour floats on the shallow Iowa River past
<a href="http://www.mycountyparks.com/County/Hardin/Park/Fallen-Rock-St-Presrve-Fallen-Rock-Wildlife-Area.aspx">Fallen Rock
Preserve</a>
and <a href="http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/Pine_Lake_State_Park/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=IA&amp;parkId=610114">Pine Lake State
Park</a>, which includes four stone-and-timber cabins and a lodge.</p>
<p>The outfitter also operates a campground, with a beer garden and
Saturday-night bands. Only people who tube can camp.</p>
<p><em>Raccoon River, Adel</em> . West of Des Moines, <a href="https://www.raccoonriverexcursions.com/">Raccoon River
Excursions</a> rents tubes that
range from three to seven hours, depending on current, on the river
between Adel and Van Meter.</p>
<h3>Illinois and Indiana</h3>
<p><em>Middle Fork of the Vermillion River near Oakwood</em> , <em>Ill</em> . In Kickapoo
State Park, east of Champaign-Urbana, <a href="http://kickapooadventures.com/tubing/">Kickapoo
Adventures</a> offers tubing trips
from 1 ½ to 3 miles.</p>
<p><em>Tippecanoe River in Winamac, Ind</em> . <a href="http://www.riversidecanoes.com/">Riverside
Rentals</a> offers 3½-mile tube trips and
also rents rafts.</p>
<p>Both tube trips are about two hours from Chicago. For more about tubing
