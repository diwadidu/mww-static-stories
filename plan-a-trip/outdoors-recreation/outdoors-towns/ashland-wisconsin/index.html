<h2>In northern Wisconsin, murals draw tourists to Ashland's thriving downtown.</h2>

<p>In Ashland, Wis., the ghosts of the past appear in living color.</p>
<p>Once, these lighthouse keepers, lumberjacks and lieutenants lived only
in the history books. Now, they're painted onto Ashland's walls, where
they serve as backdrop to shoppers, college students and tourists going
about their business downtown.</p>
<p>The first mural, painted for Wisconsin's sesquicentennial in 1998 by
local artists Kelly Meredith and Susan Prentice Martinsen, featured the
snowshoe-clad figure of pioneer Asaph Whittlesey as well as editor Sam
Fifield, Ojibwe Chief Buffalo and other characters from the town's
early days.</p>
<p>&quot;They were trying to get everyone into one picture,&quot; says Ashland
Historical Society Museum curator Sharon Manthei. &quot;They didn't know it
was going to snowball.&quot;</p>
<p>Townspeople asked for more murals, so Meredith and Martinsen kept
painting. The mural of armed-forces veterans is a favorite with locals,
Manthei says, but tourists like the mural of early storefronts, with
patrons played by current residents who dressed up and modeled for the
painters.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Every town has buildings like that,&quot; Manthei says. &quot;It's a soft
spot with everybody.&quot;</p>
<p>The murals give tourists a good reason to poke around downtown Ashland,
where many of the old brick and brownstone buildings depicted still
stand.</p>
<p>On West Main Street, the South Shore Brewery and DeepWater Grille found
a new home in an 1895 brick grocery after their old one in the 1887 Soo
Line Depot burned.</p>
<p>On Chapple Avenue, tourists who appreciate top-notch pastries, espresso
and vegetarian food make a beeline to the Ashland Baking Company, the
Black Cat Coffeehouse and Chequamegon Food Cooperative, next to the
&quot;Dhooge's Store&quot; mural.</p>
<p>On Main Street, Gabriele's sells exquisite handmade European-style
cookies and chocolates at small-town prices.</p>
<p>The Bay Theatre still shows first-run movies, and department, hardware
and drug stores have survived the town Wal-Mart.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/sheboygan_blue_harbor_resort.jpg" alt="Hotel Chequamegon in Ashland." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Hotel Chequamegon is a re-creation of an 1877 grand hotel that
burned.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Unlike Bayfield, the resort town across Chequamegon Bay, Ashland always
has been a trade town, ever since French fur traders Radisson and
Chouart landed on its shores in 1659 and put up a shack that became the
first European dwelling in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Two hundred years later, treaties opened Ojibwe land to Europeans, and
the bay filled with rafts of newly cut timber and boats ferrying locally
quarried brownstone to cities in the east.</p>
<p>When the Upper Peninsula's Gogebic Range began producing iron ore,
freighters carried it out of docks in Ashland.</p>
<p>None of the five giant docks remains. Eight stories high and the length
of five football fields, the last one was a curiosity in an economy
propelled by tourists: &quot;They always asked, 'What's that big thing
sticking out in the water?' &quot; Manthei says.</p>
<p>After shipping ended in the mid-1960s, Ashland settled into a
postindustrial slump.</p>
<p>But in 1971, Northland College led a shift from exploitation of
resources to conservation, introducing environmental studies and, a year
later, founding the Sigurd Olson Environmental Institute on its campus.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Today, the environmental liberal-arts college is a member of the
collegiate Eco League and is known for minting park rangers, naturalists
and biologists who hone their skills nearby in the Apostle Islands
National Lakeshore and Chequamegon National Forest.</p>
<p>Sustainable living and recycling now are the watchwords in Ashland,
especially at Timeless Timber, which searches lakes and riverways for
virgin timber that sank during log drives.</p>
<p>Founded in 1992 as Superior Water-Logged Lumber Co., the Ashland company
raises the logs, dries them and sells the finely grained wood for use in
fine furniture, carvings and musical instruments.</p>
<p>These days, there's a lot going on in Ashland. Its Book Across the Bay
race/tour in February has become one of the most popular events of the
winter, with skiers and snowshoers flying across Chequamegon Bay to
Washburn on a course lit by ice lanterns and bonfires.</p>
<p>In October, the WhistleStop Marathon and Half Marathon also draws
thousands to town.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/s/ashland_asaph_mural.jpg" alt="A building mural in ashland." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A mural starring town founder Asaph Whittlesey, in snowshoes, was the
first of many.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Ashland is a good base for waterfall fans; the four counties that border
Lake Superior's south shore hold the state's nine largest falls.</p>
<p>The town's craft brewery, the first in northern Wisconsin, keeps the
region supplied with fine ales, and the adjoining restaurant is always
packed.</p>
<p>But perhaps the best reason to stop in Ashland, rather than whizzing
through to Bayfield or the Upper Peninsula, is the Northern Great Lakes
Visitor Center.</p>
<p>Opened in 1998, the handsome center on the corner of U.S. 2 and
Wisconsin 13 proves, once again, that nothing about Lake Superior is
boring.</p>
<p>The center is actually a beautifully designed exhibit hall, with
displays showing the height of the last glacier in relation to the Sears
Tower (the glacier was taller) and the bottom of Lake Superior in
relation to Death Valley (the lake is lower).</p>
<p>The whole history of the region is there, from the Ojibwe migration to
logging, mining, attempted farming and the dawn of the tourist age, when
footloose people in Model Ts began to challenge the timber industry for
access to the wilderness.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the auditorium, documentaries on wolves, Ojibwe culture, Lake
Superior and the Edmund Fitzgerald show every half-hour.</p>
<p>But the part of the center that invariably draws a crowd is the
free-standing relief map of the Lake Superior region, with tiny lights
that show lighthouses, shipwrecks, shipping lanes, population centers
and indigenous communities.</p>
<p>No one can resist pushing the buttons and trying to identify which light
represents which lighthouse or shipwreck.</p>
<p>On one weekend, an older man was doggedly arguing with park guide Penny
Nelson-Newman about the location of the Caribou Island shoals, which the
Fitzgerald might have scraped just before it sank in 1975.</p>
<p>But the map has a broader purpose, Nelson-Newman suggests.</p>
<p>&quot;There was this one little guy who looked at the map and said, 'I feel
puny,' &quot; she said. &quot;He got it, and that was really neat.&quot;</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The center, staffed by the National Park Service, has become Ashland's
gathering spot, screening films and hosting the annual fur-trade
rendezvous. Its motto is &quot;We're All About the Stories.&quot;</p>
<p>In Ashland, there's a story around every corner.</p>
