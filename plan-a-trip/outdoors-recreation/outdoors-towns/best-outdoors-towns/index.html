<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_hiking_brewers.jpg" alt="Brewers Ridge on the Superior Hiking Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Duluth, a hiker stops to admire the view from the Superior Hiking
Trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In 2014, Duluth made the region proud by beating out 63 other U.S. towns
in Outside magazine's <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/north-america/united-states/Best-Towns-Results.html">best outdoors
town</a>
tournament.</p>
<p>It's hard to argue with Duluth, even against such better-known outdoors
towns as Boulder, Colo., and Missoula, Mont., because everything it
offers is right in the city-hiking, mountain biking, paddling,
skiing.</p>
<p>But other towns are almost as deserving. Here are 10 great outdoor towns
in the western Great Lakes.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/best-duluth-minnesota/">Duluth, Minn.</a></h3>
<p>What <em>doesn't</em> this Lake Superior port town have?</p>
<p>There's <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/superior-hiking-trail-duluth/">hiking</a> on the 43
miles of Superior Hiking Trail that cross the town, mountain biking on
the fast-developing 100-mile <a href="https://www.coggs.com/duluth-traverse">Duluth
Traverse</a> and paddling on Lake
Superior and the St. Louis River. It even has 16 trout steams.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In winter, there's <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/skiing-in-duluth/">cross-country
skiing</a> on 82 kilometers
of trails plus alpine skiing at Spirit Mountain and Chester Bowl. And
ice rinks pop up everywhere.</p>
<p>Duluth crushed each of its competitors in the Outside tournament and
received a total of 221,350 votes. Provo, Utah, got 185,602 votes, and
Minneapolis received the third-most votes with 93,164. On the cover of
the magazine's September issue, Duluth was proclaimed <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/best-towns/Best-Towns-16-Greatest-Places-to-Live-in-America.html">The Best Town
Ever</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/michigan-pictured-rocks-national-lakeshore/">Munising</a> — <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/marquette-michigan/">Marquette</a>, Mich.</h3>
<p>Okay, Duluth doesn't have a national park. Munising does-Pictured
Rocks National Lakeshore on Lake Superior. Its cliffs are spectacular
when viewed from a kayak and also from the 42-mile section of the North
Country National Scenic Trail that traverses them.</p>
<p>Its neighbor on the Upper Peninsula, Marquette, is a college town with a
hardy population that loves to dog-sled and ski downhill at Marquette
Mountain and cross-country in the national forest that surrounds the
town.</p>
<p>There's also paddling on Lake Superior and many nearby inland lakes.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/wausau-wisconsin-whitewater-paddling/">Wausau, Wis</a>.</h3>
<p>This is Wisconsin's answer to Duluth. It's got alpine skiing mountain
right in town, on majestic Rib Mountain, and cross-country skiing on 55
kilometers of county trails. It's even got a tubing hill.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_harriet_kayaking.jpg" alt="Paddling on Lake Harriet in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Minneapolis, kayakers paddle on Lake Harriet.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Downtown, there's a whitewater-paddling course on the Wisconsin River
that hosts regional, national and even international competitions, and
boating on dozens of lakes in the area.</p>
<p>The Ice Age National Scenic Trail skirts town, so there's superb hiking
on it and also in Rib Mountain State Park.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/copper-harbor-michigan/">Copper Harbor</a> -Houghton, Mich.</h3>
<p>The remote Keweenaw Peninsula gets piles of snow every winter and offers
double black-diamond skiing as well as nordic skiing.</p>
<p>In summer, paddlers head out on the Keweenaw Water Trail and mountain
bikers ride more than 25 miles of single track around Copper Harbor.</p>
<p>And both towns are gateways to wild <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/isle-royale-national-park/">Isle Royale National
Park</a>, a mecca for backpackers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/cruises-in-lacrosse/">La Crosse</a> — <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Trempealeau</a>, Wis.</h3>
<p>La Crosse is known more for its bars, but its prime spot between the
Mississippi River and Driftless Area bluffs gives it plenty to do
outdoors.</p>
<p>There's paddling on the Goose Island Canoe Trail and Black River,
hiking and cross-country skiing in Hixon Forest and alpine skiing at
Mount LaCrosse.</p>
<p>Around Trempealeau, there's  paddling on the Long Lake Canoe Trail and
hiking on historic McGilvray Road and in Perrot State Park.</p>
<p>Both La Crosse and Trempealeau are part of a 101-mile string of bicycle
trails. The 24-mile Great River Trail starts north of Trempealeau and
follows wetlands to Onalaska, where bicyclists can continue on the
22-mile La Crosse River Trail.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Traverse City, Mich.</a></h3>
<p>This town has gorgeous beaches wrapped around both arms of Grand
Traverse Bay, so it's a prime spot for swimming as well as paddling on
Lake Michigan and  the Boardman River.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanesboro_bike_spring.jpg" alt="Bicycling on the Root River Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicyclists ride the Root River State Trail near Lanesboro.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Bicyclists love the 26 miles of paved trails that wind through town and
also the country roads in the Leelanau and Old Mission peninsulas and
around Torch Lake, Michigan's longest inland lake.</p>
<p>The alpine mountain at Shanty Creek is just outside town, and there's a
smaller ski and tubing hill at Mount Holiday.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/minneapolis-chain-lakes/">Minneapolis, Minn</a>.</h3>
<p>Yes, this city in a metropolitan area of 3 million is a great outdoors
town, thanks to its spectacular, city-owned Chain of Lakes plus the
Mississippi River, which is part of a <a href="https://www.nps.gov/miss/index.htm">national
park</a>.</p>
<p>The lakes are lined with beaches, parkland and bike trails, in
particular the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-minneapolis-grand-rounds/">Grand Rounds National Scenic
Byway</a>. The city teems with bicyclists,
many of them on green Nice Ride bikes, and it trades the No. 1 Bike City
titles back and forth with Portland, Ore.</p>
<p>In winter, park trails are groomed for cross-country skiing, and in
March 2020, Wirth Park was scheduled to host the first World Cup event
on U.S. soil in two decades.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-summer-madison-wisconsin/">Madison, Wis</a>.</h3>
<p>Wisconsin's capital has its own chain of lakes and bicycle trails,
connecting to a network of state trails that can take bicyclists east to
Milwaukee, west to the Mississippi and south to the Illinois border.</p>
<p>There's hiking north of town on the Ice Age National Scenic Trail, and
in winter, locals head for skiing and tubing hills nearby.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/traverse_city_volleyball.jpg" alt="Beach volleyball in Traverse City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Traverse City, volleyball players set up in West End Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/bayfield-summer-wisconsin/">Bayfield, Wis</a>.</h3>
<p>During cold winters, this Lake Superior village gets a huge boost from
visitors who flock in to see the mainland ice caves on the Apostle
Islands National Lakeshore. It's a great <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/bayfield-winter/">winter
destination</a>, with an
alpine hill, 20 kilometers of cross-country ski trails and dog-sled
mushing.</p>
<p>But traditionally, it's a kayaking mecca, drawing paddlers who want to
visit the 21 Apostles and Madeline Island. And bicyclists can tackle
hilly routes around the peninsula.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Lanesboro, Minn.</a></h3>
<p>In southeast Minnesota bluff country, this village became popular with
the opening of the 42-mile Root River State Trail, though fly fisherman
had discovered its cold, pristine streams long before.</p>
<p>In summer, bicyclists cruise the trail and paddlers and tubers cruise
the river. In winter, there's good cross-country skiing on the
Harmony-Preston Valley State Trail, west of town.</p>
