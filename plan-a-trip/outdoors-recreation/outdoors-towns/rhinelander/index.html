<h2>dd</h2>
<p>Torsten and I had followed the Wisconsin River north to Rhinelander on a radiant late-fall day, stopping to hike at the Dells of the Eau Claire near Wausau and Council Grounds State Park in Merrill.</p>
<p>Torsten and I drove into town. We wanted to see Rhinelander�s famous hodag, a mythical beast born in the logging camps. Camp newcomers were first to be regaled with stories about it, supplemented by bloodcurdling wails from the nearby swamp.</p>
<p>Then, in 1896, timber cruiser Gene Shepard actually came up with a spiked, leathery carcass he said he'd found in the swamps. He managed to keep the hoax going for a week before confessing that he�d made it.</p>
<p>ADS:16</p>
<p>The locals didn't mind. By then, Rhinelander had acquired the nickname Hodag City and a mascot for its sports teams. A big hodag now crouches outside the visitors center year-round, and smaller, artist-decorated hodags stand around town in summer and are shown off in parades.</p>
<p>From Rhinelander, we drove 20 miles north with our bicycles to try out the new, 8�-mile Three Eagles Trail between Eagle River and Three Lakes. It was a beauty, starting out in a corridor of hardwoods and emerging to an open marsh, where fluffy white clouds mirrored lily pads, a swaying river of grass and a purplish fringe of maple trees.</p>
<p>Then it ducked into black spruce and tamaracks, with boardwalks crossing a cranberry marsh and a forest floor lumpy with mounds of moss.</p>
<p>On the Cranberry Boardwalk, I found Ruth Sproull and Vicki Reuling leaning over the railing, looking for wild cranberries.</p>
<p>�You can find every tree species in the north woods on this trail,�� Reuling said. �My husband always says, 'Slow down for a wild ride.' Quite a few people have seen bears and porcupines.��</p>
<p>Both she and Sproull are part of the coalition that got the trail built.</p>
<p>�It was an old logging road, owned by the paper companies,�� Reuling said. �We knew we didn�t want it to be long and straight, so we tried to zigzag it around to make it fun.��</p>
<p>After five miles, the crushed-limestone trail swings south, paralleling U.S. 45. In Three Lakes, it passes the Three Lakes Winery, which specializes in cranberry wine, and ends in Don Burnside Park.</p>
<p>We were due at Woodwind Spa for massages, so we hurried back to Rhinelander. My therapist was JoAnn Trein, who played Indian flute music and applied muscle ointment homemade by Champney.</p>
<p>�We�re working the muscles; it�s like exercising, except you don�t have to do anything,�� she said.</p>
<p>Torsten�s massage was with Champney, who is renowned for her powerful hands. When he emerged, he looked groggy, as if he�d just woken up from a very long sleep.</p>
<p>�Boy, does she have a thumb,�� he said. �I feel completely relaxed.��</p>
<p>IMG:RIGHT</p>
<p>Over dinner � cranberry-apple stuffed chicken, homemade mashed potatoes with gravy, triple chocolate cake � Champney told us her life story, prompted by the quilters, who urged her to write a cookbook/memoir.</p>
<p>Many of them had had massages, too. Having spent the entire day hunched over quilts and scrapbooks, they needed them.</p>
<p>By breakfast the next day, we�d become part of the slumber party, chatting with the quilters and admiring their work.</p>
<p>�This is so much nicer than those awkward B&amp;B breakfasts,�� Torsten said. �Everyone�s telling stories. If all girlfriend getaways are like that, I want to take part in one.��</p>
<p>Woodwind Spa may not be for the Kohler Waters or Sundara crowd. But it�s a good kind of spa for Rhinelander.</p>
<p>Call it the people�s spa. In 2006, Budget Travel magazine called Woodwind one of &quot;America's Top Spa Values.''</p>
<p>�People say, �Why don�t you cater to rich clients?� �� Champney says. �But we like to have all kinds of people. We have running groups, kayakers, bikers, cancer survivors, friends like this group, families. People come here to relax and let go.</p>
<p>�There�s energy in this place; it�s built with love,�� she said. �Whatever you release here, stays here. You don�t carry it home.��</p>
