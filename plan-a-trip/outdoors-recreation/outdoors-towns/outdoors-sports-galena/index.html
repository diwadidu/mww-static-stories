<h2>In an Illinois shopping town, tourists discover life beyond Main Street.</h2>

<p>So you've done Galena — the shopping, the wine-tasting, the trolley
tours, the historic houses.</p>
<p>What now?</p>
<p>This mining town in northwest Illinois boomed, went bust and came back
as a boutique town for urban weekenders. Now, it's returning to nature.</p>
<p>Canoes and kayaks glide down a river once clogged with barges full of
galena, or lead ore. Bicyclists follow on an old railroad spur. Birders
prowl hillsides that once bristled with smelting chimneys.</p>
<p>Those hillsides, their trees shorn to feed the furnaces, gradually slid
into the river, which had shrunk so much by 1910 that trade boats no
longer could make the 4-mile trip from the Mississippi.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything was done at the expense of the river,&quot; says Bill Norton
of the Galena Historical Society. &quot;The slag and dross from the smelters
went into the river, and noxious fumes killed all the vegetation.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But today, all is green and peaceful. Herons glide over paddlers, and
muskrats swim along the shore. On the Galena River Trail, hikers and
bicyclists pass a wetland and patches of wildflowers along limestone
cliffs.</p>
<p>One Memorial Day weekend, I paddled down the river with Norton and
Merrilee Lee, the society's assistant director.</p>
<p>Galena's boom started in 1827, six years before Chicago was founded,
but all its goods had to come up the river. By the 1850s, Chicago also
was booming, and the newly rich merchant class went there to vacation
and shop.</p>
<p>&quot;Galenians often were criticized in Chicago's City Council for the
amount of land-buying they were doing,&quot; Norton said. &quot;They invested
very heavily in Chicago, which turned out to be brilliant.&quot;</p>
<p>Once, 85 percent of the nation's lead came out of Galena, but demand
waned after the Civil War, and after World War I, the town fell into a
deep sleep.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a slum; it was a working museum,&quot; Norton said. &quot;It had
vacancy rates of 70 percent and broken windows on Main Street.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/a/galena_river_canoes.jpg" alt="Canoeists on the Galena River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>In the 1960s, Chicagoans came to Galena with money, investing heavily in
the town. They renovated its untouched brick storefronts, and antiques
dealers moved in. Mansions were made into B&amp;Bs. Now it's a perfect
little tourist town, filled with milling crowds every weekend in summer
and fall.</p>
<p>As we rounded a corner lush with white and purple dame's rocket,
ducklings paddled madly to get out of our path, and church bells rang
from one of three white steeples. It was a pastoral scene, yet Lee
wished she could see what Galena looked like during its
first heyday.</p>
<p>&quot;If I could go back for five minutes, that's what I would want to see,
that view of all the steamboats and all the activity,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In 1854, Galena was the most prosperous town on the Upper Mississippi.
So it was the first stop on the Grand Excursion, a flotilla of Eastern
railroad promoters, including former president Millard Fillmore.</p>
<p>For the sesquicentennial of the Grand Excursion, Galena spruced up its riverfront, putting
in a levee walkway that now is one of the town's most popular
attractions, Norton says.</p>
<p>Then the crushed-limestone Galena River Trail opened, following the
river 3½ miles along cliffs and meadows.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Near the U.S. 20 bridge, an outfitters opened and began
offering kayak and canoe tours of the river and bicycle and scooter
tours of the countryside. A local dentist leads Saturday birding tours,
and a conservation group hosts nature walks and events.</p>
<p>After our canoe excursion, we hiked two miles down the trail, stopping
to watch a turtle. When we returned to the levee walkway, a backwards
canoe race was under way. Jean Muchow and Lydia Zaya were there, too,
laughing and cheering for two zigzagging young women.</p>
<p>By then, motorcycles were pouring into town, creating a din, and we
could see bumper-to-bumper cars on Main Street.</p>
<p>&quot;We usually don't come down on weekends,&quot; said Muchow, a lifelong
Galena resident who says she prefers the town when it's quieter.</p>
<p>So does Zaya, who belongs to Friends of the Galena River Trail and comes
into town on Tuesdays to walk with the group. But the retired Chicago
transplant saw what Galena looked like before tourists came, so she
doesn't mind the crowds.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chicago people discovered Galena, and then the Chicago people
saved it,&quot; she said. &quot;Without tourists, we wouldn't have
anything.&quot;</p>
