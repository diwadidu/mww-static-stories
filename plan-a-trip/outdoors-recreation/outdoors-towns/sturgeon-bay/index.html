<h2>A longtime gateway, Sturgeon Bay also is a great getaway.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/sturgeon_bay_fireboat_cruise.jpg" alt="Cruise boat in Sturgeon Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 1930 Michigan Street Steel Bridge is a town landmark.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It would be natural, for a tourist, to arrive in Sturgeon Bay and just
keep going. It would also be a mistake.</p>
<p>The rest of Door County has all the tourist trappings. But Sturgeon Bay
has appeal of its own.</p>
<p>&quot;Most people want to go farther up on Door County, for all the shops
and such,&quot; says Bill Munroe, a volunteer at the Door County Maritime
Museum. &quot;But this is a working town. We like it down here. We like it
very much.&quot;</p>
<p>Tourism always has gone hand-in-hand with industry in the town, where a
waterway separates the high-profile northern Door from the agricultural
southern Door.</p>
<p>The first summer resort opened in 1879, across from stone quarries at
the mouth of the fish-shaped bay. In 1882, the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal
lengthened the long bay into a shortcut to Lake Michigan, and
shipbuilding companies grew with the increased traffic.</p>
<p>At the peak of World War II, nearly 7,000 workers at four shipbuilders
were launching a new ship every five days.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Now, the town has just two — Palmer Johnson, which builds luxury
yachts, and Bay Shipbuilding, now making double-hulled oil barges to
replace such single-hulled carriers as the Exxon Valdez.</p>
<p>In the Maritime Museum, &quot;A Job Well Done&quot; tells how the city boomed
during the war, and other exhibits tell dramatic stories of Great Lakes
seafaring over the years.</p>
<p>Today, Sturgeon Bay is geared mainly toward tourism. Boats carry
tourists instead of cargo, the rail line now is a bicycle trail, and
mansions have been turned into inns.</p>
<p>Two state parks flank the town, one renowned for its rocky shoreline and
one for its sand beaches.</p>
<p>So it's fun to be a tourist in Sturgeon Bay.</p>
<h3>Cruising a canal</h3>
<p>One Memorial Day weekend, I hit all the main sights, starting with Big
Red, an 1882 fog-signal building that glows fire-engine red in early
evening, when I walked to it along the canal pierhead.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/sturgeon_bay_big_red_tourists.jpg" alt="Sturgeon Bay's Big Red and tourists." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A family walks along the pierhead after looking at Big Red, a fog-signal
building on Lake Michigan.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>With the 1899 lighthouse tower behind it, the canal station on Lake
Michigan is a two-fer for lighthouse fans, and there's a third
lighthouse at the other end of town, on Green Bay's Sherwood Point.</p>
<p>That lighthouse I saw on a cruise aboard a 1937 former Chicago fireboat,
also painted fire-engine red. With its wisecracking captain, we went
under the Michigan Street lift bridge.</p>
<p>Chugging along, we passed Potawatomi State Park and then the 1883
lighthouse on Sherwood Point.</p>
<p>Leathem Smith, the Sturgeon Bay shipyard owner who invented the
self-unloader for cargo boats, drowned off the point in 1946 after the
hull of his yacht swamped in a squall. Turns out that a bulkhead had been removed so
the previous owner's father, President Franklin Roosevelt, could move
around better in his wheelchair.</p>
<p>Heading back down the bay, past Sunset Park and the giant gantry above
Bay Shipbuilding, we went under the lift bridge again and entered the
ship canal.</p>
<p>It made Sturgeon Bay a busy port, but now it's used mainly by sport
fishermen, yachts and the Coast Guard.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Hiking in the dunes</h3>
<p>From the canal station, Rustic Roads 77 and 9 follow the lakefront to
Whitefish Dunes State Park, where long sand beaches curve around
Whitefish Bay.</p>
<p>I followed the Red Trail above the dunes and then into a meadow, through
an unusual mix of reindeer moss, prairie wildflowers, juniper and ferns
— the result of a sand-dunes ecosystem in boreal-forest conditions.</p>
<p>Near the visitors center, the loop dipped into thick beech-maple forest
and, joining the Brachiopod Trail, followed cedar forest along rocky
shoreline. A dwarf lake iris bloomed at forest's edge, and dozens of
columbines grew from rocks that were studded with fossils.</p>
<p>On the Green Bay side of town, Potawatomi State Park occupies the
headlands on the west side of Sturgeon Bay.</p>
<p>From the top of the observation tower, 225 feet above the water, I could
see Sherwood Point Lighthouse and boats puttering around Sawyer Harbor,
site of the first resort.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/sturgeon_bay_downtown.jpg" alt="Shops in downtown Sturgeon Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Shops and cafes flourish downtown.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From the base of the tower, I walked the first miles of the 1,000-mile
Ice Age National Scenic Trail, which shares part of the park's
spectacular, 3½-mile Tower Trail before it heads west toward Minnesota.</p>
<p>There's a third place to hike right in town, on the trails of
Crossroads at Big Creek, a nature preserve.</p>
<p>Five miles of trails fan out from the learning center; I walked along a
shady, cedar-lined creek, through prairie meadow and on to a small
astronomical observatory.</p>
<p>The weather was lovely, so there was no reason to be sedentary. But if
I'd felt like it, I could have stayed within a three-block radius of my
downtown inn and had a great time.</p>
<p>I could walk a block to the shops, restaurants and coffeehouses of Third
Avenue and a block to the bayfront and the bridge; the Maritime Museum
and Door County Cruises dock are just across the water.</p>
<p>Downtown, I had dinner, shopped on Third Avenue and checked out the
booths at that weekend's Market Square Fine Art Fair. I would have
checked out the many gift shops on Jefferson Street, if not for the
great weather.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/sturgeon_bay_motel.jpg" alt="Holiday Music Motel in Sturgeon Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I did get &quot;bridged&quot; on my visit to Sturgeon Bay. Just as I drove up to
the 1930 rolling-lift bascule Michigan Street Steel Bridge, the bells
started ringing and the arms lowered.</p>
<p>So, I had to wait. Of course, I could have taken the highway bridge and
bypassed town. But now that I know more about Sturgeon Bay, my days of
rushing through are over.</p>

<p><em>Accommodations:</em> The 1952 <a href="http://www.holidaymusicmotel.com">Holiday Music

nice as well as inexpensive.</p>
<p>The owners sold the motel in 2007 to a group of music lovers and
musicians, including Jackson Browne, who organize the annual Steel
Bridge SongFest, proceeds from which support the preservation of the
bridge.</p>
<p>Now it has a music studio and rooms decorated by musicians. The
breakfast area evokes a 1950s dinner.</p>
