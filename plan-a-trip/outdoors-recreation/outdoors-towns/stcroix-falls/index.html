<h2>For hikers, bicyclists and paddlers, this river town is a crossroads.</h2>

<p>In western Wisconsin, St. Croix Falls has become a destination for
people who want to go places.</p>
<p>It's the western terminus of the 1,000-mile Ice Age National Scenic
Trail, which traces the last glacier as it began to melt and retreat
northward, leaving a marvelously lumpy patchwork of rock, rubble and
river gorges.</p>
<p>It's the southern trailhead of the 48-mile Gandy Dancer State Trail, a
scenic crushed-limestone bicycle trail named for the rail workers who
rhythmically swung pickaxes and hammers made by the Gandy Tool Co.</p>
<p>And it's the headquarters of the 252-mile St. Croix National Scenic
Riverway, with a new visitors center that helps paddlers plan trips from
the Namekagon to the St. Croix's confluence with the Mississippi.</p>
<p>There are another 12 trails in Interstate State Park, which became
Wisconsin's first state park in 1900 and is the start of the Ice Age
Trail.</p>
<h3>Gliding on the Gandy Dancer</h3>
<p>One weekend, we headed north on the crushed-limestone trail, riding to
Luck via Centuria and Milltown.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The trail parallels Wisconsin 35, but we saw it only twice between
towns; trees lining the trail have grown so tall they create a pleasing
tunnel effect, with branches that arch over the trail.</p>
<p>The next morning, we rode the other way on the trail, past the Polk
County Information Center and up to Interstate State Park.</p>
<p>From its riverfront picnic grounds, where we watched the Taylors Falls
Princess paddlewheeler chug by with a load of tourists.</p>
<h3>Hiking the Ice Age Trail</h3>
<p>From the park, the first seven miles of the Ice Age National Scenic
Trail head down the hill and into town, over Wellness Esker, up through
Riegel Park and back down to Lions Park on the river.</p>
<p>I walked it once years ago but got lost on the Mindy Creek section, near
a neighborhood of new homes.</p>
<p>Today, that's one of the best-marked and most scenic sections, next to
the newly completed, ¾-mile Zillmer Point loop, named for the Milwaukee
lawyer who founded the Ice Age Park and Trail Foundation, now the Ice
Age Trail Alliance, in 1958.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_croix_falls_ice_age.jpg" alt="Walking the Ice Age trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Near the end of Day Road, we easily found the beginning of the Mindy
Creek trail and began following the yellow blazes and white Ice Age
signs into a dark and rocky ravine, emerging to a meadow with
outcroppings of volcanic rock and a view of Minnesota over the treetops.</p>
<p>From there, we descended through private woods-thank you, Mr. or Ms.
Landowner-to Wisconsin 35 and Lions Park, from which the Indianhead
section heads north.</p>
<p>We walked on it for half a mile, which is how we discovered what has to
be one of the sweetest campsites ever, a clearing right on the river
with its own little sand beach, picnic table, tent pad, fire ring and
vault toilet.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, it doesn't get any better than this,&quot; Torsten said. &quot;The
National Park Service: your tax dollars at work.&quot;</p>
<p>Someday, we'll come back to paddle the canoe route, too. Winter also is
a good time to hit the trails; there's skiing at Interstate State Park
and nearby Balsam Branch and snowmobiling on the Gandy Dancer.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Exploring around town</h3>
<p>Another weekend, we went to St. Croix Falls to hike and bike, but a
storm quashed our plans.</p>
<p>Luckily, St. Croix Falls also has shop and wineries to visit.</p>
<p>North of town, we checked out Chateau St. Croix, a winery that
proprietors Troy and Laura Chamberlin built to replicate the atmosphere
of vineyards in Europe and especially Germany's Rhine Valley, where
they lived while Troy served in the U.S. Air Force.</p>
<p>With its classical statuary, peaked roofs and stone-look facade, it's
an unusual but welcome sight in the rolling St. Croix countryside.</p>
<p>While we were there, a wedding party of young people was running in and
out of the tasting room, designed to look like a 16th-century English
hunting lodge.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/a/taylors_falls_pothole.jpg" alt="A pothole in Interstate State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Interstate Park, potholes formed in rock.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At the door, the bride waited next to a knight in shining armor, and
around a chess table, a foursome of older folks in high-backed carved
chairs was having a great time sipping wine and people-watching.</p>
<h3>History in the park</h3>
<p>By then, the sun had come out, but it was too late to hit the trails. So
instead, we drove to the Ice Age Interpretive Center in Interstate State
Park and walked the Pothole Trail, where whirlpools laced with sand and
gravel drilled cylindrical holes in solid rock.</p>
<p>Then we went down to Lake O' the Dalles, where longtime re-enactor
Dennis Hoffa of Danbury had become Jacques for the evening program,
&quot;Voyageur Stories.&quot;</p>
<p>Paddling up to the shore in a canoe, Jacques explained that the year was
1800, when French-Canadian voyageurs paddled bales of beaver pelts and
trade goods on the rivers between Montreal and the St. Croix, often
lugging 180-pound packs over portages.</p>

<p>&quot;You people will have Lewis and Clark and think they are great, and
they were,&quot; he said. &quot;However, the fur traders did that every year. It
was nothing special, just our life.&quot;</p>
<p>Rain or shine, there's always something to do in St. Croix Falls.</p>
