<h2>In North Shore village, it's fun to flout winter.</h2>
<p>During a Grand Marais winter, it doesn't hurt to have the grit of a hivernant, as well as a good set of polypropylene underwear.</p>
<p>On a sunny day outside the North House Folk School, two modern-day hivernants, voyageurs who wintered over, were encamped, nonchalantly brewing tea over an open fire, bare hands sticking out of wool blanket coats. ``Bonjour, mademoiselle, it is a fine day, n'est ce pas?'' they called as I passed by.</p>
<p>Well, it was 10 below zero, and the ink in my pen had frozen, but yes, it was fine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, three miles away at the breakfast table of the Pincushion Mountain B&amp;B, three skiers were avidly discussing moleskin and homemade ''nose jocks.'' We could see a howling wind tousling the aspen on the shoreline below, but they still were planning to compete in that weekend's Sawtooth International Cross-Country Ski Race.</p>
<p>``It's a disease, it's like being addicted to drugs,'' said Noel Hong, a pharmacist from Bayfield. ``I mean, you're paying to go out on a day like this and get frostbite.''</p>
<p>Grand Marais was settled by hardy people, and those are still the types it attracts. But Grand Marais, despite being cold and remote, is not without its luxuries.</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>Last January, I drove up to Grand Marais and checked into the Pincushion Mountain B&amp;B, a hilltop aerie surrounded by 25 kilometers of cross-country ski trails. Before the light faded, I skied out the door onto the Canyons Curves Loop, an up-and-down trek through the forest. Then, I drove half an hour up the Gunflint Trail to the cozy Bearskin Lodge for a four-course meal of turkey-rice soup, mixed greens with strawberries, stuffed pork chops with garlic mashed potatoes and banana-cream pie.</p>
<p>Then I headed out on Bearskin's 1{1/2}-kilometer twinkle-lighted loop. The perfectly groomed trail gripped my skis, which was a good thing, because I couldn't stop looking at the northern sky, where big patches of stars were shimmering through a canvas of black.</p>
<p>Back at Pincushion, proprietor Mary Beattie had revved up the sauna, so I could bake away the evening chill.</p>
<p>This isn't exactly winter as experienced by the trappers, loggers and fishermen who lived in this outpost a century ago, when the winter's provisions had to be brought in by steamer before Lake Superior iced over.</p>
<p>The next morning, I could see the famously cold lake steaming in the distance, 50 degrees warmer than the air. Oh-oh. It was nothing, however, that a little polypropylene and moose leather couldn't handle.</p>
<p>After a breakfast of turkey sausage and French toast with baked pears, I took a pair of Mary and Scott Beattie's snowshoes north of town to the Devil Track River. From County Road 58, a 2.4-mile stretch of the Superior Hiking Trail follows the rim of the river's narrow canyon to the Devil Track Bridge. The trail was already packed, but my crampons came in handy on slippery inclines, especially since I was paying more attention to the scenery -- red rock cliffs, frozen waterfalls, the vivid white of aspen bark against ice-blue sky -- than to the trail.</p>
<p>In town, I had a cappuccino and made my traditional visit to Joyne's Ben Franklin. I didn't need anything, but I like to wander its old-fashioned aisles, packed with heavy wool shirts, sheepskin slippers, rabbit hats and other neat stuff.</p>
<p>A few blocks away, at the North House Folk School, a chili cookoff was under way. Near a cluster of woodcarvers and a woman knitting sleeves for a Swedish boiled-wool jacket -- the school teaches traditional artistry -- I sampled entries from six restaurants. The winner was the East Bay Hotel's green chili, made with potatoes; the Coho Caf� in Tofte and the Gunflint Tavern in Grand Marais came in second and third.</p>
<p>Nearly too full to ski, I drove six miles up the Gunflint Trail to the George Washington Trail, a beautiful 3{1/2}-kilometer trail through a corridor of red pines. The dramas of northwoods life were sketched in the snow: rabbit tracks everywhere, threading in and out of flocked heaps of downed boughs and, occasionally, meeting sets of larger tracks with a longer stride.</p>
<p>Craig and Dianne Peterson of Waseca also were out enjoying the trail. They'd been skiing around Grand Marais for 20 years, they said, and finally bought a cottage on Devil Track Lake.</p>
<p>``It gets harder and harder to go home, but we're working on that,'' Dianne Peterson said.</p>
<p>That evening, I returned to the North House Folk School, which was holding a village dance as part of its annual WinterFest. To the sweetly insistent strains of the hardanger fiddle, played by Elizabeth Weis, and the instruction of Mary Seim, the crowd line-danced, some of us in mukluks and fleece, others in bunads and tasseled breeches.</p>
<p>It was even colder the next day, and the steam rising off Lake Superior had taken on the look of Dante's Inferno. The two hardy voyageurs -- actually, John Kavanagh-Beltman, who teaches snowshoe-making and woodworking, and his friend Corey Kulogi -- still were stationed outside the North House, sitting around the fire, where a charred goose leg hung forlornly on a spit.</p>
<p>In the parking lot, folk-school founder Mark Hansen and instructor Peter Henrikson were giving rides on a Finnish whip sled, a plank on a long pole that is whipped in a circle by muscle power. I gave it a whirl, a very bumpy whirl. It turns out that, in Finland, riding the whip sled is a sort of teen rodeo event.</p>
<p>``The boys would get on, with the girls watching, and see how long they could hang on without getting thrown off,'' Hansen said. ``I saw one in Finland and thought, hmm, I think we need one of those.''</p>
<p>On a winter day in Grand Marais, there are many unusual sights to be seen. If there's enough snow for this year's WinterFest, there will be reindeer races. In February, the John Beargrease Sled Dog Race will go through town, followed by Winter Trails Days, with sled-dog and skijoring races. If you don�t know what skijoring is, the North House will teach you, in classes on two January weekends.</p>

<p>It'll be a blast -- just don't forget those long johns.</p>
