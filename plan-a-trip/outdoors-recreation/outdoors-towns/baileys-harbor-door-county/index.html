<h2>On the Lake Michigan side of the famous peninsula, this town draws nature-lovers.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baileys_harbor_range.jpg" alt="Range lights in Baileys Harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
These two range lights helped boat captains navigate their way into
Baileys Harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Every May, wildflower followers find their way to Baileys Harbor.</p>
<p>They walk past two 1870 range lights on a boardwalk lined by endangered
dwarf lake iris.  On  strips of wetland called swales, they look for
bogbean and goldthread. In June, they search for 25 species of orchids.</p>
<p>The land Ridges Sanctuary occupies almost became a trailer park. Now,
it's habitat for more species of plants than any other place in
Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The preserve is why many people visit Baileys Harbor. But even more come
to photograph its lighthouses, kiteboard off its breezy beach and
bicycle on its roads.</p>
<p>The town is the biggest on the Lake Michigan side of Door County, and
arguably the most outdoorsy destination on the peninsula.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's also the most-how should we say this?-<em>normal</em> -looking
town on the Door Peninsula. It isn't tourist-cute; there are dive bars
along with delis and ice-cream shops.</p>
<p>Some tourists don't notice that Door County is made up of a series of
towns. It  can be hard to tell, especially on the Green Bay side of the
peninsula, because of the non-stop stream of ice-cream parlors, wineries
and gift shops.</p>
<p>All of the towns also have lovely beaches and parks. But each town has a
different personality, and each has attractions that set it apart from
the others.</p>
<p>So . . . what makes Baileys Harbor special?</p>
<h3>The nature sanctuary</h3>
<p>At Ridges Sanctuary, trails follow 30 sand ridges separated by wetland
strips called swales. Just inland from Lake Michigan, they're cooled by
lake breezes that give it the characteristics of boreal forest, normally
found much farther north.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baileys_harbor_kiteboarding.jpg" alt="Kiteboarding in Baileys Harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Kiteboarders ride Lake Michigan breezes off Ridges Road County Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The threatened dwarf lake iris grows here by the thousands, along with
Arctic primrose, cancer root and many rare orchids, including ram's
head lady's slipper.</p>
<p>In 1937, locals saved the land from use as a trailer park. With the help
of Chicago landscape architect Jens Jensen, who built the nearby folk
school The Clearing, they turned it into a nature preserve.</p>
<p>Over Memorial Day weekend, Ridges offers dozens of field trips during
Festival of Nature. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/door-county-wildflowers/">Spring in Door
County</a>.</p>
<h3>The beach</h3>
<p>Across Ridges Road from the sanctuary is a county park with a wide,
sandy beach that's breezy and usually 10 to 20 degrees cooler
than the rest of the county.</p>
<p>It's a favorite spot for kiteboarders and windsurfers.</p>
<p>There's another beach south of town, Anclam Beach Park, with a
playground.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baileys_harbor_cana.jpg" alt="Cana Island Lighthouse near Baileys Harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Visitors to the 1870 Cana Island Lighthouse pick their way over a rock
causeway.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>The lighthouses</h3>
<p>North of town, the shining white <a href="http://www.dcmm.org/cana-island-lighthouse/">Cana Island
Light</a> is one of Lake
Michigan's prettiest.</p>
<p>Visitors pick their way over a rock causeway, sometimes through water,
to get to the 1870 lighthouse, which is open daily from May through
October. The
<a href="http://www.dcmm.org/cana-island-lighthouse/hours-admission/">tour</a>
costs $12, $9 for children 5-17.</p>
<p>At Ridges Sanctuary, the two <a href="http://www.dcmm.org/cana-island-lighthouse/door-county-lighthouses/range-lights/">range
lights</a>
have one red and one white light; sailors lined them up to get &quot;on
range&quot; while entering the harbor.</p>
<p>There's a fourth beacon at the tip of the point across from the harbor.
An old &quot;bird cage&quot; lighthouse, it was built in 1852 and closed after
the range lights were built.</p>
<p>You can see it from a kayak, canoe, pontoon or powerboat rented from
<a href="http://lakeshore-adventures.com/">Lakeshore Adventures</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>The inland lake</h3>
<p>This shallow inland lake is the largest in Door County. The southern end
is developed with resorts and cottages, and the northern part is mostly
wetlands and includes the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=335">Kangaroo Lake State Natural
Area</a> and
two small preserves.</p>
<p>With Ridges Sanctuary, Lakeshore Adventures offers a <a href="http://lakeshore-adventures.com/door-county-kayak-tours">kayak
tour</a>
of Kangaroo Lake.</p>
<h3>The natural areas</h3>
<p>There are 28 <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/">state natural
areas</a> in Door County, and
six of them are around Baileys Harbor, including Kangaroo Lake, Ridges
Sanctuary and Meridien Park.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=57">Toft
Point</a> is
perhaps the best known. The former home of <a href="http://womeninwisconsin.org/emma-toft">Emma
Toft</a>, &quot;Wisconsin's First Lady
of Conservation,&quot; it's down Ridges Road from Ridges Sanctuary.</p>
<p>Toft and her family operated a summer resort on the land, and she
refused to sell to developers. The 686-acre point is gorgeous, with a
trail leading through forest and more than two miles of shoreline.</p>

The ice-cream shops of Baileys Harbor are favorite stops for bicyclists
and other tourists.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>The brewery</h3>
<p>Door County is better known for its wineries, but it also has two
breweries. In Baileys Harbor, <a href="http://www.doorcountybrewingco.com/">Door County Brewing
Co.</a> names its beers after local
characters, locations and events: Polka King Porter, Little Sister
Witbier and Goat Parade Stout.</p>
<p>Its taproom is just west of town on County Road F, and on weekends it
hosts bands. In June, it sponsors the <a href="http://doorcountybeerfestival.com/">Door County Beer
Festival</a> at Town Hall Park.</p>
<h3>The Shakespeare plays</h3>
<p>In the gardens of <a href="http://www.lawrence.edu/dept/bjork/">Björklunden</a>,
the northern campus of Lawrence University in Appleton, the <a href="http://www.doorshakespeare.com/">Door
Shakespeare</a> troupe performs from early
July to mid-August.</p>
<p>The campus, on the lakeshore just south of town, also offers <a href="http://www.lawrence.edu/s/bjorklunden/bjorkseminars">weeklong
summer seminars</a> on
such topics as literature, politics and philosophy. Students can stay at
the lodge or pay a commter rate, which includes lunches and Sunday
dinner.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>The <a href="http://www.lawrence.edu/s/bjorklunden/chapel">stavkirke</a></h3>
<p>Also on the grounds of Bjorklünden, which is Swedish for &quot;birch grove
by the lake,&quot; there's wooden Boynton Chapel, modeled after a
medieval stave church in Lillehammer, Norway.</p>
<p>Inside, there are 41 hand-painted frescoes and carved furniture.</p>

<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baileys_harbor_gordon_lodge.jpg" alt="Gordon Lodge on North Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Gordon Lodge is north of town on North Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><a href="http://www.gordonlodge.com">Gordon Lodge</a>, once the estate of a Sturgeon Bay
physician, occupies a point on Lake Michigan's North Bay, halfway
between Baileys Harbor and Ephraim/Sister Bay.</p>
<p>If you like the &quot;Mad Men&quot; look, you'll love the elegant retro decor
of the newly refurbished 1961 lodge rooms, each with private patio
facing the lake. On the bay side, atop lichen-covered rock, 1940s
cottages have wood-burning fireplaces and a similar retro style.
They're reserved for adults.</p>
<p>Cottages with a more modern decor are on the lake side. There's a sand
beach, plus outdoor pool and hot tub. Kayaks and bicycles are available
for guests.</p>
<p>A hot breakfast is served in the equally stylish Gordon House. On the
top story of the 1930s stone boathouse, a restaurant with water views is
open to the public.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.baileysunsetmotelandcottages.com/">Bailey's Sunset Motel &amp;
Cottages</a>. This inn
occupies seven acres on Highway 57, a mile north of Baileys Harbor. It
allows pets for an additional $15 per day and has a playground and
large back yard.</p>

DVD player and electric fireplace. There's also a motel that includes
an economical small room. Wood is included for fire pits.</p>
