The Lower Harbor Ore Dock was used from 1932 to 1971 and is a city

<p>The first time I visited Marquette, I saw mostly Yooper Land.</p>
<p>I chuckled at a 10-foot mosquito, a giant chainsaw and packages of
Roadkill Helper. I noted the best-sellers in the bookstore window: &quot;A
Look at Life From a Deer Stand&quot; and &quot;Leap of Faith 2: God Loves
Packer Fans.&quot;</p>
<p>This is the Marquette that's sports-crazy, hunting-happy and tough as
nails, with a population descended from Cornish, Finnish and Italian
immigrants who could put up with the rigors of iron mines and, later,
their closings.</p>
<p>A few years later, I saw cosmopolitan Marquette. Elegant townhouses had
sprouted along its harbor on Lake Superior, and an exhibit of art doors
lined jogging paths like giant dominoes. I shopped in a gallery and
bought a picnic lunch at the food co-op.</p>
<p>That's the Marquette named a Distinctive Destination by the National
Trust for Historic Preservation, which cited its arts and architecture
and called it &quot;a must-see for travelers looking to get off the beaten
path.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Marquette has barely 20,000 people but is the largest town on
Michigan's Upper Peninsula, sometimes called Baja Wisconsin.</p>
<p>It's so off the beaten path that many people from Lower Michigan never
make it there — nearly 500 miles and Lake Michigan separate Marquette
from Detroit.</p>
<p>The thickly forested U.P. is the Alaska of Michigan, to which it
contributes only 3 percent of the state's population. Locals think they
suffer the Lower 48's longest winter and heaviest snowfalls, and
they're almost right.</p>
<p>Residents have the same feisty independence as Alaskans; between trips
to Green Bay, their sports and shopping mecca, they occasionally agitate
for secession as the 51st state of Superior.</p>
<p>At the heart of this wilderness with attitude is Marquette, a
still-flourishing port and home of Northern Michigan University.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/marquette_harbor.jpg" alt="Mattson Park and Lower Harbor in Marquette." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Lower Harbor, Mattson Park hosts the big city festivals.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Built on riches from the 1844 discovery of pure iron deposits in
Negaunee, eight miles to its west, Marquette is a handsome town.</p>
<p>Rising from hills on the lip of Lake Superior are a succession of ornate
red-sandstone buildings that the National Trust calls
&quot;magnificent.&quot;</p>
<p>There's the 1894 city hall, with its tiled roof and cupola; the domed
1902 Beaux Arts courthouse; and the 1890 twin-towered Romanesque St.
Peter's Cathedral, in which Frederic Baraga, &quot;the snowshoe priest,&quot;
is buried.</p>
<p>This Slovenian priest is the original tough guy of Lake Superior,
arriving in 1831 and cementing his place in history with a long and
frenetic life canoeing and snowshoeing between Ojibwe settlements in
Sault Ste. Marie, La Pointe in Wisconsin and Grand Portage in Minnesota, compiling an Ojibwe
dictionary on the side.</p>
<p>He ended up in Marquette, which now is the center of efforts to canonize
him.</p>

<p>Other hardy folks are commemorated at the Maritime Museum, near the 1866
Marquette Harbor lighthouse.</p>
<p>The &quot;storm warriors&quot; of Marquette's life-saving station became
renowned for their heroics, and in 1899 developed the first motorized
lifeboat for rescues along the rocky shoreline.</p>
<p>Today, that same shoreline is the pride of Marquette. A five-mile
bicycle path starts from the downtown harbor, once heavily industrial
but now lined with art installations, sailboats and newly built condos.</p>
<p>I was looking at an exhibit called &quot;Grandma's Doors,&quot; honoring the
lives of local women, when I met retired school administrator Judy
Valente.</p>
<p>&quot;I remember when there were big piles of coal here; it was
horrible,&quot; she said. &quot;Now, I can sit in the Vierling restaurant and
watch the ice skaters, and it's almost like a Norman Rockwell
painting.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/marquette_lighthouse.jpg" alt="The lighthouse in Marquette." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Marquette Maritime Museum offers tours of the 1866 Harbor Light.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Across from the old wooden ore dock at the foot of downtown, I met
another tourist coming out of Thill's Fish House. John Gorisch of
Downers Grove, Ill., said he'd been vacationing on nearby Lake
Michigamme for more than 50 years.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, there's a million things to do around here,&quot; he said. &quot;I
explore all over. I go into the woods, and now I'm going to (the nearby
town of) Christmas to look for some nice round rocks.&quot;</p>
<p>From downtown, the bicycle path hugs the lake, passing Mattson Park, the
Maritime Museum and the strawberry-red lighthouse on its way to
McCarty's Cove, with a wide crescent of fine white sand, and Shiras
Park, across from a rocky island crowded with gulls.</p>
<p>It passes the modern ore dock, where 1,000-foot Great Lakes freighters
drop off coal and pick up taconite pellets from the two mines that still
operate in Negaunee and Ishpeming. Then it arrives at Presque Isle Park.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>This narrow peninsula is Marquette's playground. It was designed by
Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed New York City's Central Park
and is called the father of landscape architecture.</p>
<p>But only 15 of its 323 acres are developed: Olmsted's firm recommended
that the city &quot;Preserve it, treasure it, as little altered as may be
for all time.&quot;</p>
<p>So it's mostly woods, including hemlock and virgin white pine,
criss-crossed by trails and girded by a narrow drive that follows more
than two miles of shoreline.</p>
<p>Kayakers frequent the two coves created by this knob of land. To the
west, there's a view of islands and the wilderness that begins where
the city ends.</p>
<p>Northern Michigan University is nearby, with its Superior Dome. It's
the world's largest wooden dome, 14 stories high, and the site of a
U.S. Olympic Education Center, one of only four nationwide.</p>

Red-sandstone buildings, including the Vierling, line Front Street.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In winter, hundreds of locals show up every day to use the dome's
walking and running tracks. They're out on the trails, too.</p>
<p>Marquette is an outdoors town, with Marquette Mountain for alpine skiers
and miles of trails for cross-country skiers.</p>
<p>In January, it hosts the Noquemanon marathon, one of the largest ski
races in the nation. In February, it's the U.P. 200 sled-dog marathon,
on which mushers race 240 miles to Grand Marais, Mich., and back.</p>
<p>In summer, the bicyclists come out. In August, Marquette hosts the
the Ore to Shore mountain-bike race.</p>
<p>Around the dome, Marquette looks like any other college town.</p>
<p>Third Street is lined with import and outdoors shops, restaurants and
coffeehouses and links the college to the dramatic hills of downtown and
more shops — &quot;a dynamic array of retail shops, galleries and
restaurants situated to provide breathtaking views of the
waterfront,&quot; said the National Trust.</p>

<p>Jim DeCaire, co-founder of Da Yoopers Tourist Trap, home of the giant
chainsaw, says the down-home Yoopers he represents don't begrudge
Marquette its big-city ways — on the contrary.</p>
<p>&quot;We consider Marquette a jewel, an exceptionally beautiful town,&quot; he
says fervently. &quot;It's one of a kind.&quot;</p>
