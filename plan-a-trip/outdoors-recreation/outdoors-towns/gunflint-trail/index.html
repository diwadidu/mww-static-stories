<h2>For outdoorsy folks, this Minnesota wilderness is a year-round playground.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_historic_signs.jpg" alt="Historic signs on the Gunflint Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Visit Cook County</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Grand Marais, refurbished signs from the 1950s point the way.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the 1920s, when the first resorts appeared along this remote, 57-mile
highway that dead-ends near the Canadian border, guests had to have a
certain sense of adventure.</p>
<p>The Gunflint Trail first was blazed by the Ojibwe, then used by fur
traders, trappers and loggers. It was still a zigzagging roller-coaster
through the woods when vacationers began to come.</p>
<p>The first visitors in spring often had to patch the single phone line,
which moose tended to snag and drag. Gasoline lanterns in their cabins
often became plugged, and bears sometimes made appearances near cabins.</p>
<p>Still, they had it easy. After the guests left, resort owners faced a
long winter of splitting wood for fuel, getting around by dog sled,
harvesting ice and trapping for food and clothing.</p>
<p>But things have changed on Minnesota's last frontier.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Today, the snow that presented so many challenges to early resort owners
is prized by modern ones.</p>
<p>It's the most reliable snow in Minnesota, usually falling in copious
amounts from November to April, and it makes the Gunflint Trail a
playground for skiers, snowshoers and mushers (for more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/gunflint-trail-winter/">The best
days of winter</a> ).</p>
<p>Today, skiers head out the door to nearly 200 kilometers of trails,
superbly maintained by state-of-the-art Pisten Bully groomers. On the
frozen lakes of the Boundary Waters, novice mushers try their skill
behind teams of eager huskies, for fun, not necessity.</p>
<p>Some of them stay on the trail in Mongolian yurts, peaked-roof canvas
huts with wood stoves, but that's about as rustic as it gets these days
on the Gunflint Trail.</p>
<p>The biggest resort is Gunflint Lodge, whose founder, the late Justine
Kerfoot, became a northwoods legend through her evocative writings about
the early days, when resort owners got by only with help from their
trapper and Ojibwe neighbors (for more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/gunflint-lodge-trail/">A Gunflint
legend</a> ).</p>
<p>Those days, when &quot;luxury&quot; meant a strip of carpet around the
outhouse hole, are gone.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_tuscarora_canoe.jpg" alt="Canoe on Tuscarora Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Canoeists paddle toward Tuscarora Lodge on Round Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Today, there's a weather-reporting station on top of the lodge, updated
on the Internet every 30 minutes. The contemporary townhouse
&quot;cabins&quot; have hot tubs and saunas. Guests still dine on fish, but
it's more likely to be rainbow trout Farci with chive <em>beurre blanc</em>
than shore lunch.</p>
<p>At Bearskin Lodge, guests can take a few spins around a 1½-kilometer
loop lined by twinkle lights and have an après-ski soak in the Hot Tub
Hus.</p>
<p>Canoes are Kevlar, jackets are Polartec and snowshoes are high-tech
Hypalon: No sense in having less than the best.</p>
<p>And yet there still are traditional resorts around the Gunflint Trail.
The Golden Eagle has a rustic 1945 lodge with walls lined with old
logging-camp tools, and a trail lit by kerosene lamps.</p>
<p>Up the road, Clearwater Lodge, built in 1926 of whole logs, has a
wonderful north-woods atmosphere; it's on the National Register of
Historic Places.</p>
<p>Nearby, the Trail Center's convivial Black Bear Bar and Restaurant is
one of the few places where skiers happily rub elbows with snowmobilers,
and locals with tourists. It was built in the 1930s, as part of a
logging camp.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>More importantly, little has changed on the Gunflint Trail's lakes and
in its forests. In spring, yellow moccasin bloom. Loons trill, and moose
graze with their calves in marshy meadows.</p>
<p>In summer, canoeists arrive, some to stay at the lake resorts and some
to push off into the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.</p>
<p>In fall, the leaves turn, and beaver gather piles of aspen branches.
This is prime time for hikers, many of whom come to try the rugged
Border Route Trail. Then winter comes, and hoar frosts make the forest
glitter.</p>
<p>There are plenty of magical moments to go around. When a skier first
glides through fresh powder along a ridgeline, high above the deep,
narrow lobes of a glacier-cut lake, or a canoeist rounds a bend to see a
moose grazing in the cattails, he'll realize why the first residents
came-and stayed.</p>

Lodge</a>, in the central
Gunflint. The outside, built for a 1930s logging camp, isn't much to
look at, but the inside is adorned with a hodgepodge of old tin signs,
moose racks, loggers' saws, wooden wheels and snowshoes.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_clearwater_lodge.jpg" alt="Clearwater Lodge on the Gunflint Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Just up the road, tables at the more modern <a href="https://poplarhaus.com/restaurant/">Poplar Haus
restaurant</a> have a nice view of the
lake. The menus is small but includes burgers, sandwiches, pizzas and
small plates served with creative flair, plus cocktails and craft beer.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://gunflint.com/dining/">Gunflint Lodge</a> serves sophisticated
northwoods cuisine in its popular restaurant Justine's and more casual
fare in a bistro, both overlooking Gunflint Lake. On Sundays in summer,
it offers a BBQ cookout.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chikwauk.com/">Chik-Wauk Museum and Nature Center</a>: Near
the end of the trail, on a southeast bay of Saganaga Lake, a historic
restored resort lodge presents exhibits on the natural and cultural
history of the trail. Five nature trails wind through the center's 50
acres.</p>
<p>The lodge is closed in winter, but the nature trails are open.</p>
<p><em>Skiing:</em> In the Central Gunflint, Bearskin and Golden Eagle share a
66-kilometer network of trails, 36 of them also groomed for skating, and
three of them lighted.</p>
<p>In Upper Gunflint, the Gunflint Lodge, Heston's, Gunflint Pines and
Moosehorn Lodge share 90 kilometers, 24 of them groomed for skating and
four lighted.</p>
<p>The 29-kilometer Banadad Trail connects the central and upper systems
and is used by Boundary Country Trekking and Old Northwoods Lodge.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Trails are groomed after Thanksgiving; call resorts for conditions.
Rates are lowest early and late in the season. Pincushion, just up the
ridge from Grand Marais, has 25 kilometers.</p>

winter</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/yurts-ski-gunflint-trail/">From
yurt to B&amp;B on the
Gunflint</a>.</p>
<p><em>Hiking:</em> Two half-mile trails provide lovely views of this pristine
wilderness. Thirteen miles from Grand Marais, the Northern Light Lake
Trail climbs up Blueberry Hill to its bald basalt pate and a panorama of
the lake and Brule River stretching into the distance. Many varieties of
lichen grow here, as well as blueberries.</p>
<p>Sixteen miles farther, turn off on County Road 66 and drive two miles,
just past the Flour Lake Campground.</p>
<p>From here, the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/superior/recreation/fishing/recarea/?recid=40303&amp;actid=50">Honeymoon Bluff
Trail</a>
climbs wooden steps to an iron-streaked cliff high above the
labyrinthine waters of Hungry Jack Lake and, beyond, West Bearskin Lake.
It's especially lovely at sunset.</p>
<p>The 65-mile <a href="http://www.borderroutetrail.org">Border Route Trail</a> winds
through the Boundary Waters and connects the Superior Hiking Trail on
the North Shore with the
<a href="https://northcountrytrail.org/trail/minnesota/kek/">Kekekabic</a> on the
Gunflint Trail. They're both part of the North Country National Scenic
Trail.</p>
<p><em>Background:</em> Read Justine Kerfoot's fascinating autobiography,
&quot;Woman of the Boundary Waters.&quot; Kerfoot was a 20-year-old student at
Northwestern University when her mother bought a summer fish camp on
Gunflint Lake in 1927.</p>
<p>The young Justine came to stay for good in 1930, when a bank crash
ruined her father and forced the family to sell their houses in
Illinois. She turned out to be a scrappy outdoorswoman and an ingenious
improviser, with a reverence for the wilderness that inspired readers of
her books and newspaper columns.</p>
