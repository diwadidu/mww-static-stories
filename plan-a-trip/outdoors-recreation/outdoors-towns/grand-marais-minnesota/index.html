<h2>On Minnesota's North Shore, this photogenic village always is ready for its close-up.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_light_station.jpg" alt="The light station in Grand Marais." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At the far tip of northern Minnesota, Grand Marais is a place that
people love even more when the weather turns.</p>
<p>When Lake Superior storms send giant waves crashing against the pier
light, photographers rush to the harbor. Blizzards bring in skiers, and
tourists flock to see ice floes and formations.</p>
<p>This photogenic village at the foot of the Sawtooth range is a drama
queen, a magnet for those who bask in the big lake's chill and revel in
its unpredictability.</p>
<p>Voyageurs, fur traders and Ojibwe came first to its natural harbor,
followed by trappers, prospectors, loggers and then the fishermen and
storekeepers who made it into a village.</p>
<p>Fishing waned, but hikers, skiers and canoeists arrived on their way up
the Gunflint Trail. To Boy Scouts and paddlers fresh from the Boundary
Waters, Grand Marais always has meant civilization, with its pizza
parlor and municipal hot tub.</p>
<p>These days, it's a tourist destination in itself, with a full array of
creature comforts: art galleries, gift shops, bistros, condos and
villas. The aroma of espresso wafts through town, and whitefish comes
with chutney, not tartar sauce.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At the height of summer, Grand Marais almost looks like an ordinary
tourist town.</p>
<p>But this still is a Riviera for the rugged. In summer, downtown streets
flood after a heavy rain. Winter is long, and spring is endless.</p>
<p>Few complain, because one thing remains constant throughout the year:
spectacular beauty.</p>
<p>Here's what you'll find in every season.</p>
<h3>Winter</h3>
<p>No matter what the season, everybody goes to Artists' Point, &quot;named
for the many people who try to catch the temperamental spirit of Lake
Superior on film or canvas.&quot;</p>
<p>It's an island-like outcropping that's covered with hunched cedars and
ringed by jagged basalt, split from a long-ago lava flow.</p>
<p>It creates Grand Marais' harbor, along with the breakwall on the other
side of the Coast Guard station. Clamber onto its root-choked paths and
you'll have a great view of the vast expanse of Lake Superior on one
side and the hazy outline of the Sawtooth Mountains on the other.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_sunset_ridges.jpg" alt="Sunset on Grand Marais harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Sunset is photographers' favorite time to shoot along the harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150111705240129.310203.104777055128&amp;type=1">early
winter</a>, waves glaze its rocky edges and coat plants with spray, creating
beautiful ice gardens.</p>
<p>On the weekend closest to the Nov. 10 beacon lighting at Split Rock
Lighthouse, the town holds the Lake Superior Storm Festival, featuring a
wave dash into the chilly lake and tales of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/north-shore-shipwrecks/">Gales of
November</a>.</p>
<p>For Thanksgiving, it's fun to rent a lakeside cabin on the lake and
watch the waves. That weekend, Santa arrives on the harbor by dog sled,
and the town Christmas tree is lighted.</p>
<p>In the depths of winter, vapor rising off Lake Superior turns the harbor
into Dante's Inferno. Because the lake is a giant heat sink, it keeps
Grand Marais 10 degrees warmer than inland areas (and 10 degrees cooler
in summer).</p>
<p>By late winter, Artists' Point has turned into a fantasia in ice. Clear
chunks lie about like Lucite paperweights, and craters ride the waves
like jellyfish, bashing each other's edges into tinsel.</p>
<p>Many people love the Grand Marais area in winter. There's skiing up on
Pincushion Mountain and snowshoeing up the Devil Track River, where the
scenery includes red rock cliffs, frozen waterfalls and the vivid white
of aspen bark against ice-blue sky.</p>
<p>It's a blast-just don't forget those long johns.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/ski-north-shore-minnesota/">Skiing the North
Shore</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-north-shore/">North Shore by
snowshoe</a>.</p>
<h3>Spring</h3>
<p>It's a little hard to tell what &quot;spring&quot; is in Grand Marais. Just
over the Sawtooths, March actually is a great time to ski on the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/gunflint-trail-winter/">Gunflint Trail</a>,
often up to Easter.</p>
<p>In April, after the alpine-ski season is over at Lutsen Mountains, hotel
rates go down. It's the slowest month of year and the only one when I
haven't visited.</p>
<p>May can be cruelly chilly or full of summer's promise. One year, spring
came early. Walking along the breakwall on the weekend before Memorial
Day, I spotted the rare butterwort, one of several arctic wildflowers
that flourish in protected nooks.</p>
<p>Nearby, I saw a few frail arctic primroses, and on the branches of a
squat spruce, buds as round and bright-red as strawberries. Life was
busting out all over.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_doughnuts.jpg" alt="World's Best doughnuts in Grand Marais." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The World's Best Donuts shop sells its wares hot off the fryer.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The nearby mouth of the Cascade River also is a trove of boreal
wildflowers-northern bluebells, goldthread, bluebead lily,
bunchberry.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/wildflowers-spring-north-shore/">Wildflowers of the North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>Real warmth may not arrive until late June-but then again, peak
hotel rates don't, either.</p>
<h3>Summer</h3>
<p>On a warm summer day, the streets of Grand Marais are festive. Everyone
is JUST SO HAPPY to be there!</p>
<p>Little kids play with the cobblestones by the Coast Guard station and
run and jump amid the outcrops of Artists' Point. Older kids ride
mountain bikes on the zigzagging concrete of the breakwall.</p>
<p>Everyone skips rocks on the harbor, the best spot in the state for it.
Just down the highway, agate-hunters crouch at Cutface Creek Wayside,
hoping to spot thomsonite.</p>
<p>First-time visitors from big cities walk around, a little dazed. Grand
Marais has all the trappings of a tourist spot, but it's still a
down-home northwoods town.</p>
<p>There's a giant walleye slicing through the roof of the bait shop and
exhaling radio music from its toothy mouth. Across the street, the aroma
of hot oil and sugar wafts out of World's Best Donuts.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/r/artists_point_fall.jpg" alt="Fall on Artists' Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The rocks of Artists Point are irresistible year-round.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At the Joynes Ben Franklin and Department Store, people clog the narrow
aisles in search of flannel shirts and rabbit-fur hats, even in the dog
days of August.</p>
<p>Artistic and crafty folks are in town, too, taking classes at the Grand
Marais Art Colony and at North House Folk School.</p>
<p>And festivals pack the town, especially Arts Festival in July and
Fisherman's Picnic in August.</p>
<p>For more about the town's long history with the arts, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/grand-marais-minnesota-arts/">Artistic
Grand
Marais</a>.</p>
<p>For more good agate-picking spots, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-north-shore/">Beaches of the North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, and remember that it's generally 10 degrees cooler than inland
areas in summer, and 30 degrees cooler than the Twin Cities. Be smart
and bring a jacket.</p>
<h3>Fall</h3>
<p>On fall weekends, everyone wants to be on the North Shore. Autumn colors
are nice but not great in Grand Marais, which is surrounded by boreal
forest.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_beaver_house.jpg" alt="Beaver House in Grand Marais." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Beaver House has been supplying bait to anglers since 1963.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But the hiking is top-notch in fall, after the bugs are gone. There's
gorgeous scenery on trails that follow four river gorges: the Cascade in
Cascade River State Park, the Devil Track, the Kadunce and the Brule in
Judge C.R. Magney State Park.</p>
<p>Eagle Mountain, Minnesota's highest point, is inland; it's a fairly
rugged seven-mile round-trip hike.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">Hiking the North
Shore</a></p>
<p>Over the Minnesota school break on the third weekend of October, the
town holds the Moose Madness Family Festival. After that, hotel rates
drop, and there's another one or two weeks of good hiking before the
firearm deer season starts.</p>
