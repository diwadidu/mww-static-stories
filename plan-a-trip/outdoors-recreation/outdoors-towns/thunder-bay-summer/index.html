<h2>Beauty is all around Lake Superior's biggest town.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/h/thunder_bay_harbor.jpg" alt="Thunder Bay's harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>To know Thunder Bay is to love Thunder Bay.</p>
<p>Lake Superior's largest town is hard to get to know, though, in part
because it was two towns until 1970. No downtown pops out of the
landscape; people driving through see only the flat sprawl of Fort
William, then the hillier sprawl of Port Arthur.</p>
<p>But Thunder Bay's surroundings are spectacular: Mount McKay on the
south, Kakabeka Falls to the west and Ouimet and Eagle canyons to the
north.</p>
<p>To the east, the Sleeping Giant stretches across the horizon. This
32-mile-long peninsula has been voted No. 1 of Seven Wonders of Canada
in a Canadian Broadcasting Corp. poll.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It received twice as many votes as Niagara Falls, the runner-up: &quot;I
could sit and look at it for hours,&quot; said Sabine Leidums, one of
those who nominated it.</p>
<p>At sunset, the view of Sleeping Giant from Port Arthur's Marina Park is
mesmerizing. The breakwall light station gleams in the waning rays, and
fleecy banks of pink and blue clouds float over the peninsula.</p>
<p>Ojibwe legend identifies it as the spirit Naniboujou, who turned to
stone when white men found the secret mine at Silver Islet, now part of
Sleeping Giant Provincial Park.</p>
<p>Thunder Bay's best lies along water. On the south edge of town,
old-fashioned Chippewa Park has amusement rides, a wildlife park,
tourist cabins and a beach on Lake Superior.</p>
<p>On the northern edge of town, Trowbridge Falls, Centennial Park and
Boulevard Lake lie along the Current River, a favorite destination of
paddlers.</p>

Marina Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>My favorite part of Thunder Bay is Fort William Historical Park, on the
Kaministiquia River west of town. It's the continent's largest
reconstructed fur post, with a legion of living-history players amid 42
buildings on 20 acres.</p>
<p>The original post, moved from Grand Portage in 1803 to the mouth of the
Kaministiquia, was a nerve center of the international fur trade. This
post, nine miles upstream, is owned and run by the Ontario government,
and it's a world-class tourist attraction.</p>
<p>When we were there, we joined families from France and the Czech
Republic on the wooded trail to the post.</p>
<p>At the wharf, we met Toronto couple Pat Viscount and Brooke Harrison,
who were winding up a tourist itinerary that included hiking in Sleeping
Giant Provincial Park, walking the suspension bridges at Eagle Canyon
and visiting 120-foot High Falls on the U.S. border.</p>
<p>&quot;We haven't stopped the whole week,&quot; Harrison said. &quot;Now we have
to go home to rest.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The action never stopped at Fort William, either. A Montreal canoe was
approaching, bearing a Métis women coming to accept a promise of
marriage to a company clerk.</p>
<p>A dance followed, accompanied by a bagpiper, and then a contract worker
named Mr. Bassett confronted haughty William McGillivray, the company
partner for whom the post was named.</p>
<p>A duel ensued, and Mr. Bassett ended up with a musket ball in his arm.</p>
<p>Everyone stayed in character, unless we asked questions that couldn't
be answered by someone living in 1815. We stayed until the place closed,
then drove farther up the Kaministiquia to 128-foot Kakabeka Falls.</p>
<p>It was no delicate northwoods cascade; it earns its nickname &quot;Niagara
of the North&quot; by roaring over a wide shelf into a large gorge lined
with rock cliffs, which gave the falls its aboriginal name.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/h/thunder_bay_fort_william_dance.jpg" alt="Engages dance at Fort William." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>We still had plenty of time to go down to the old Canadian Northern
depot in Marina Park, where a punk band was playing and families
strolled along the lakefront eating ice-cream cones and kettle corn.</p>
<p>Thunder Bay's strength is in neighborhoods that still have one foot in
the Old World. In the morning, we joined the pilgrimage to the Hoito in
the basement of the Finnish Labour Temple.</p>
<p>Founded in 1918 to supply young bushworkers with low-cost meals —
Hoito means &quot;care&quot; in Finnish — it became famous for its
crepe-like pancakes.</p>
<p>Next to us at the counter, Gordon Johnston of Peterborough, Ontario,
said even his lawyer asked about the Hoito when he heard Johnston was
heading west.</p>
<p>In Canada, Thunder Bay also is known for Terry Fox, the young athlete
who lost a leg to cancer and began a run across Canada in 1980,
completing 26 miles each day in a Marathon of Hope.</p>
<p>Just northeast of Thunder Bay, advancing cancer forced him to stop. A
memorial and visitors center mark the site and is a popular destination.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/h/thunder_bay_fort_william_voyageur_canoe.jpg" alt="A voyageur canoe makes a loop from Fort William." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Johnston saw Fox running near Wawa, on the other side of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a thrilling moment in my life,&quot; he said. &quot;He went by and
lifted his hand as we applauded.&quot;</p>
<p>Next to the Hoito, we stopped at Authentique, a gift shop that carries
versions of an inuksuk, the rock cairn that was the symbol of the 2010
Olympic Games in Vancouver.</p>
<p>&quot;They're sentinels to travelers in Canada's north country,&quot; said
clerk Georgia Muncaster. &quot;Every piece represents perfect balance; each
part of the whole is crucial to its existence.&quot;</p>
<p>Somehow, we started talking about bakeries, and Muncaster recommended
three that serve the local favorite, a jam-filled doughnut called a
Persian.</p>
<p>We made a mental note, then walked to the adjoining Italian neighborhood
and joined the queue at the meat counter of the Maltese Grocery.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/h/thunder_bay_stores.jpg" alt="The Bay & Algoma neighborhood of Thunder Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Eight people were busy making sandwiches and doling out salami and
sausage. When it was our turn, a friendly young woman told us that first
we needed to pick out freshly baked buns.</p>
<p>&quot;First-timers, eh?&quot; she asked with a smile.</p>
<p>When I go to Thunder Bay, I eat. This trip, I also collected the local
candy bars — Mr. Big, Eat More, Wunderbar. To an American, Thunder Bay
is just exotic enough.</p>
