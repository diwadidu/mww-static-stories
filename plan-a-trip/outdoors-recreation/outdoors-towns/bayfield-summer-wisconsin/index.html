<h2>On Wisconsin's north coast, the love affair between a village and its visitors goes way back.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/bayfield_from_water.jpg" alt="Bayfield as seen by the water." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bayfield is built on a hillside overlooking Chequamegon Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On a summer day on Chequamegon Bay, there are few sights more enchanting
than the sailboats bobbing around Bayfield.</p>
<p>With the Blessing of the Fleet in June , the tourist season kicks into
high gear.</p>
<p>Ferries chug nonstop between Bayfield and Madeline Island. Excursion
boats head for the other Apostles. Sailboat captains take out novices
and teach them how to hoist a jib.</p>
<p>Once, these waters were full of cargo boats, ferrying brownstone and
lumber and herring to cities in the East. Bayfield hummed with industry,
and town fathers hoped it would become another Chicago.</p>
<p>But it was too beautiful, and too remote. Orchards took the place of
pine forests, and the quarries on the Apostle Islands became parkland.
Tourists came instead.</p>
<p>The first boom came in the 1880s and 1890s, when opulent hotels were
built and excursion boats came from Detroit and Chicago.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Wealthy visitors from other Midwest states built summer homes. The
grandest house was built in 1890 by a Civil War general from Illinois
who came to relieve his asthma in the cool lake breezes.</p>
<p>The area's fortunes waned after the turn of the century, and tourism
waned, too. But eventually, tourists rediscovered the area.</p>
<p>&quot;When we first came here, it was really just a fishing village,&quot; says
Maggie Osgood of Rockville, Md. &quot;The transition has been fascinating.&quot;</p>
<p>In 1975, Gen. Fuller's Victorian &quot;summer cottage&quot; became an inn and
introduced tourists to the bed and breakfast concept; other inns
followed. Condos went up along the waterfront and vacation homes in
former orchards.</p>
<p>In 1997, the Chicago Tribune, after a six-week search, declared
Bayfield, pop. 600, the &quot;Best Little Town in the Midwest,&quot; leading to
mixed feelings among long-time residents.</p>
<p>&quot;People don't want Bayfield to become like Door County,&quot; Osgood
said. &quot;Part of the charm is it still has its simplicity.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/p/apostles_sand_island_caves.jpg" alt="Kayakers at the Sand Island sea caves." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The short trip from Bayfield to Sand Island is popular with kayakers.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But if Bayfield isn't the best little town in the Midwest, it's a
contender. Just look at it, a hillside of clapboard cottages mixed with
Queen Annes, spilling down to the harbor, where a bobbing sea of white
hulls and masts gleam in the setting sun.</p>
<p>Just to the north, the 21 islands of the Apostle Island National
Lakeshore rise from the lake, misty green in the distance. Over a strait
crisscrossed by ferries, there's 14-mile-long Madeline Island, its
cottages mostly swallowed by woods.</p>
<p>On Madeline, there's a state park and a town park, both with beautiful
beaches. There's the elegant Lotta's Lakeside Cafe as well as Tom's
Burned-down Cafe, a funky nightspot.</p>
<p>The Madeline Island Historical Museum tells the fascinating story of the
fur trade, whose Lake Superior center was La Pointe (for more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/madeline-island-wisconsin/">Madeline's
magnetism</a>
).</p>
<p>On the Apostles, there are sea caves and sand dunes and shipwrecks.
Excursion boats from Bayfield keep busy taking tourists to see them, and
outfitters take groups of kayakers to the islands on overnight camping
trips.</p>
<p>Bayfield has a few blocks of shops, most displaying the work of
northwoods artists, and coffeehouses, which sell pastries made with the
marvelous organic strawberries, raspberries and apples grown on the
ridge above town.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's got hip Maggie's and unabashedly old-fashioned Greunke's, both
of which serve whitefish livers sauteed with onions and green pepper
(the town's motto is &quot;Real Tourists Eat Whitefish Livers!&quot;).</p>
<p>It has a walking trail along the bay, a nature trail around a restored
1912 iron bridge and the Big Top Chautauqua, where foot-stomping
musicals about Lake Superior alternate with concerts by nationally known
performers.</p>
<p>But what really makes this area different is what you don't see. You
don't see fast food or franchise motels. You don't see billboards or
neon or even stoplights.</p>
<p>You don't see giant condo complexes, and you don't even see crowds,
except outside the ice-cream stand on warm summer nights.</p>
<p>That's due to the work of people who have loved this Lake Superior
community. In 1970, Wisconsin senator Gaylord Nelson got Congress to
create the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore.</p>
<p>Impresario Warren Nelson founded the Carnegie Hall of Tent Shows in
1986, and on Madeline Island, Tom Nelson's Carnegie Hall of Junkyards
helps keep the island on island time.</p>
<p>There's philanthropist Mary Rice, who brought great food to town, and
captain Dave Strzok, who keeps track of island history.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/bayfield_fish_boil.jpg" alt="Fish boil in Bayfield." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Greunke's is known for its fish boils.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Squadrons of volunteers, many retired, work at historic sites and as
rangers on the islands.</p>
<p>Residents serve on a lot of committees, all trying to keep Bayfield as
unspoiled as it is.</p>
<p>The long winter helps; in fact, it helps so much that year-round
residents have to work around the clock in summer so they can afford to
stay in winter.</p>
<p>Still, it's quite a magic trick, keeping the village shipshape but not
slick, inviting but not ingratiating.</p>
<p>As one in a long line of tourists-and, yes, I've eaten whitefish
livers-I'm glad the magic is still holding.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Bayfield, Wisconsin, in summer and fall</h3>
<p><em>When to go:</em> Peak season is July and the first half of August. In late
August and early September, it's a little quieter, and that's also the best time to swim.</p>
