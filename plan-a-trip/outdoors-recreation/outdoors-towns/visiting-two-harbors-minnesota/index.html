<h2>This Lake Superior port town is all about trains, boats and automobiles.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_harbors_ore_boat.jpg" alt="Ore boat approaching Two Harbors." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
An ore boat approaches the Agate Bay docks at dusk.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Most people know Two Harbors only by its spine, Minnesota 61, where a
long gantlet of gas stations and fast-food joints tries to reel in
tourists speeding up the North Shore.</p>
<p>Yes, Two Harbors is the last place to get a Big Mac before Canada. But
there are better reasons to stop there.</p>
<p>Most tourists never see the massive ore docks, just a stone's throw from
a picturesque breakwall, boat launch and walking trail. Or the North
Shore's last working lighthouse, a 1892 brick beacon that glows
flame-red in the afternoon sun.</p>
<p>There's a real shipwreck across Agate Bay, frequented by scuba divers.
The schooner Ely became part of the west breakwall, next to the ore
docks, after it went down in an 1896 gale.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>That was the year the Edna G. went into service. The coal-powered tug
was the St. Bernard of the North Shore and assisted in hundreds of local
mishaps and World War I, until she was retired and made into a museum.</p>
<p>The tug sits across from the docks, at a spot once known as Hell's Four
Acres, a whiskey-soaked oasis that belonged to the town's first white
settler until the railroad paid him a fortune to sell it.</p>
<p>Today, it's covered with wildflowers, and tourists walk over it to see
the Edna G. and watch ore boats loading.</p>
<p>Two Harbors always has been in motion. Tourists whizzing by in
automobiles move its economy these days.</p>
<p>But the town grew around the bay, where trains rumbled down from the
Iron Range to meet a steady stream of ore boats sent by John D.
Rockefeller, Marshall Field and other far-off tycoons.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_harbors_light.jpg" alt="The lighthouse in Two Harbors." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Two Harbors' lighthouse is a magnet for tourists.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Its most legendary home-grown character was famous for continuous
motion: John Beargrease, who delivered the U.S. mail between Two Harbors
and Grand Marais in all weather conditions, traveling by dog sled,
rowboat and on foot.</p>
<p>His trail became a highway. After it was paved, in 1924, Two Harbors
became an automotive center.</p>
<p>The trains still come down to Agate Bay, as they have since 1884, and
1,000-foot ore boats still sidle into the small bay to get taconite
pellets and take them to the steel mills in the East.</p>
<p>Ore Dock No. 1 once was the world's largest loading dock.</p>
<p>If you're lucky, you'll see a train pull onto the dock and release its
dusty red contents into chutes that drop the ore directly into bins on
the boat. It takes only minutes; Two Harbors holds the world record for
fastest loading.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The Lake County Historical Society preserves the past at four museums,
three on the waterfront.</p>
<p>Volunteers show visitors around the little Edna G., which was at her
best when disaster struck. She rescued 13 men from the wrecked Niagara
in 1904 and 24 from the Edenborn during the big storm of 1905.</p>
<p>For nearly a century, she pulled boats off reefs and broke through ice,
often damaging herself.</p>
<p>One of the few wrecks in which she wasn't involved was right in Agate
Bay, when an 1896 gale drove the Ely into the breakwall. A fisherman's
sailboat rescued the 11-man crew.</p>
<p>The 1910 Depot now is a museum that allows visitors to glimpse the
town's colorful past through photos: of legendary musher John
Beargrease with his wife; a moose team pulling a sleigh; miners during
the Lake Vermilion gold rush of 1865-68.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_harbors_breakwall.jpg" alt="A family walks along the Two Harbors breakwall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A family strolls along the Agate Bay breakwall, across from the ore
docks.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Two massive black locomotives stand outside the depot-the Mallet
229, a 1943 monster that weighs more than 1 million pounds, has 36
wheels and is one of the largest locomotives in existence, and the
diminutive 1883 Three Spot, which looks like The Little Engine That
Could.</p>
<p>A few blocks away, the 3M Museum occupies the building in which the
company was founded in 1902.</p>
<p>The founders _ a Two Harbors attorney, a doctor, a meat cutter and two
railroad executives _ thought they had found corundum, a hard
abrasive, at a site near the Baptism River.</p>
<p>But it was anorthosite, a lower-grade mineral worth little except on
sandpaper. So they made sandpaper, and eventually other abrasives and
adhesives, and the company grew into a blue-chip behemoth.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people think St. Paul is where it started, but this is where
it started, in the sticks,&quot; volunteer Eldon Platcek told us when we
were there. Scotch tape, he said, may have been named for a complaint
directed at manager William McKnight: &quot;Tell that Scotch to put more
glue on his tape.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>And it was the historical society who restored the 1892 red-brick
lighthouse, operating it as the Lighthouse B&amp;B so it can pay for its own
upkeep.</p>
<p>It's a working lighthouse, the oldest continually operating on the
North Shore, with a beam electronically controlled from Duluth.</p>
<p>Now, hundreds of guests, or volunteer &quot;lighthouse keepers,&quot; take
care of the details, raising and lowering the flag, checking the light,
weeding the garden, filling the birdfeeder and entering completed duties
in a leatherbound journal, as real keepers did a century ago.</p>
<p>When they're finished, they retire to spare but tasteful rooms
furnished with quilts, wrought-iron beds and steamer trunks.</p>
<p>The lighthouse is surrounded by land that the Duluth, Missabe and Iron
Range Railway Co. sold to a private developer. His plan was to
build condos and a hotel, though it's been on hold for years.</p>

Fog often shrouds the Sonju Trail on Lighthouse Point.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For now, Lighthouse Point still is a magical place, with a cedar and
spruce forest that's often shrouded in fog. The volunteer-built Sonju
Trail winds through it, lined with wildflowers and raspberries and home
to deer.</p>
<p>Hikers can follow the trail to Burlington Bay, home to the popular
municipal campground and one of the North Shore's rare sandy beaches.</p>
<p>Unlike Agate Bay, it's a good place to look for agates, as is Flood Bay,
a mile north.</p>
<p>There are many scenic spots farther north, drawing tourists like a
magnet. But people who get to know Two Harbors don't whiz by any more.</p>

<p><em>Dining</em> : Thanks to Castle Danger brewery, the old downtown is coming back to life. Near the taproom and museum, <a href="https://www.louisesplacecafe.com/">Louise's Place Cafe</a> is open for breakfast and lunch and serves sandwiches, burritos, salads, soup and desserts.</p>
<p>For great craft beer, go to the taproom of <a href="http://castledangerbrewery.com/taproom/">Castle Danger
Brewery</a>. It doesn't serve food, but Do North Pizzeria delivers there, and you
can bring your own.</p>
<p>On the highway, the <a href="http://www.thevanillabean.com/">Vanilla Bean</a>
is very popular for coffee, baked goods or lunch.</p>
<p>At Superior Shores resort just east of town, the
<a href="http://www.superiorshores.com/Kamloops-Restaurant/superior-shores-resort-dining-restaurant-kamloops.html">Kamloops</a>

fish-boil area and a little bridge that carries guests over wetlands to
a long beach.</p>
