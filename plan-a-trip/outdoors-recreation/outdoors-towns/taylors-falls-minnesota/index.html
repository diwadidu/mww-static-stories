<h2>Thanks to glaciers, Taylors Falls is the Pothole Capital of the World.</h2>

<p>There's only one place in the Midwest where potholes are a tourist
attraction instead of a nuisance.</p>
<p>Standing at the bottom of the 35-foot-deep Bake Oven, touching walls as
smooth as vinyl, it's easy to imagine the scene 10,000 years ago, when
sheets of water from a melting glacier roared past Taylors Falls, into
what now is the St. Croix River Valley.</p>
<p>They came with such fury that whirlpools laced with sand and gravel
drilled cylindrical holes into solid rock — potholes, the world's
deepest.</p>
<p>On the Minnesota side of the river, that fury must have had apocalyptic
proportions. Behind Angle Rock, where the river takes a hard right,
there's an otherworldly place of giant slabs and cavities.</p>
<p>Here, so many potholes formed that they merged into what now is called
the Devil's Parlor. The Bake Oven, where one pothole bored into another,
is nearby, along with the Lily Pond, the Hourglass and the 67-foot
Bottomless Pit.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Along the river, the waters tore away everything but the hardest
volcanic rock. Its vagaries nudged relentlessly at softer rock, leaving
formations that have long fascinated tourists, especially the craggy Old
Man of the Dalles.</p>
<p>Named Dalles of the St. Croix — dalle is French for rocky slab —
this gorge is a first cousin of the Wisconsin Dells, where meltwater
sculpted riverside formations out of softer sandstone.</p>
<p>The St. Croix dalles occupy a shorter stretch of river, but the captains
of the paddlewheelers who have been showing it to tourists since 1904
have plenty to point out: The Lion's Head and the Elephant's Head. The
Turk with a turban.</p>
<p>And there's the Holy Cross, for which French fur-traders named the
river. From a different angle, it turns into a face that the loggers
called the Old Egyptian.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/a/taylors_falls_old_man.jpg" alt="The Old Man of the Dalles." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Old Man of the Dalles is a landmark along the St. Croix River
bluffs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>These Dalles, however, occupy a much more picturesque valley.
Minnesota's Interstate State Park preserves the western shore, and
Wisconsin's Interstate State Park preserves it on the east; together,
they're called &quot;Gift of the Glaciers.&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone comes here: Hikers, to walk along the high bluffs.
Rock-climbers, to rappel down the hairline of the Old Man. Children, to
gambol like mountain goats among the fantastic formations. Canoeists, to
paddle down the river.</p>
<p>And sightseers come in crowds to look at fall colors and browse in the
shops of Taylors Falls' tiny downtown.</p>
<p>There's always been plenty of traffic around Taylors Falls.</p>
<p>In the 1840s, lumbermen from Maine streamed into the St. Croix Valley to
launch the nation's next timber boom. It arrived with a vengeance.</p>
<p>In 1886, three miles of logs, enough to build 20,000 three-bedroom
houses, created the world's largest logjam around Angle Rock; it took
200 loggers six weeks to clear.</p>
<p>Settlers followed in the 1850s, among them groups of Swedes who walked
from Taylors Falls' steamboat landing into Chisago County, giving it the
largest concentration of Swedes outside Sweden.</p>
<p>Swedes still are coming to Taylors Falls, now as tourists: The area was
featured in &quot;The Emigrants&quot; and three other historical novels written
by Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg, who spent the summer of 1948 in
Chisago City while researching pioneer letters and diaries.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It was the Yankees, however, who first got a foothold in Taylors Falls.
W.H.C. Folsom came to Prairie du Chien on the Mississippi in 1836 at age
19, having spent $200 to buy independence from his father in Maine.</p>
<p>He worked his way up to Taylors Falls, prospered in the lumber and
mercantile businesses and, in 1855, built a Greek Revival house on the
hill overlooking the town and valley.</p>
<p>It and its furnishings stayed in the family until it was bought,
restored and opened for tours by the Minnesota Historical Society.</p>
<p>The Folsom House is the largest of a collection of Federal and Greek
Revival homes, all white with green shutters, that sit in a park-like
setting that immigrant workers sarcastically dubbed &quot;Angel Hill.&quot;</p>
<p>Visitors still can see the dent in the plank floor from Mary Jane
Folsom's heel where she worked the pedal of the piano Bill shipped in
from St. Louis.</p>

juice, and one of Mary Jane's hoop skirts, worn by a mannequin.</p>
<p>It's a vestige of a steamboat era that hardly seems gone in Taylors
Falls.</p>
