<h2>The wilderness around this Minnesota town exerts a magnetic pull on city folk.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/ely_burntside_cabin.jpg" alt="A burnt-orange cabin at Ely's Burntside Resort is frequently" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
No. 26, one of the distinctive butterscotch cabins at Burntside Lodge,
probably is the most-photographed cabin in Minnesota.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Ely, one picture is worth a thousand tourists.</p>
<p>Who could ignore the call of its photogenic expanses of sky-blue water
and rocky islands amid spruce forest? Who isn't drawn to a shimmering
image of the northern lights, or of a moose and calf browsing in a patch
of wild calla lilies?</p>
<p>To see Ely is to want to be there, enveloped by tranquility.</p>
<p>The scenery has been around for a long time, ever since glaciers carried
off the soil and left a stony, stripped-down landscape that, to many, is
the essence of the north woods.</p>
<p>The reputation came later, when the 1.1 million-acre Boundary Waters
Canoe Area Wilderness was created and Ely became known as the hub of the
unspoiled wilderness. In 1998, National Geographic Traveler magazine
named the Boundary Waters one of 50 places in the world everyone should
visit.</p>
<p>The area always has inspired rhapsody.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Anyone who has known the deep woods and the blue lakes, for a week or
a season, puts himself to sleep ever afterward with memories of Ely,&quot;
wrote the late television personality Charles Kuralt, who called Ely the
best place to spend July in his book of favorite places, &quot;Charles
Kuralt's America.&quot;</p>
<p>Local naturalist Sigurd Olson, in his first published work in 1921,
described its &quot;naked grandeur as God intended it to be, unscathed by
the hand of man.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, Olson wasn't very popular with many locals after the BWCAW
was created in 1978.</p>
<p>Not everyone waxed rhapsodic about the unsullied wilderness. Others also
appreciated the lake country, but from the motorized boats that now are
largely prohibited.</p>
<p>Sportsmen were among the first to arrive after the pine forests were
logged. By then, miners had been in Ely for decades; at one time, four
iron-ore mines operated within city limits.</p>
<p>The last one closed in 1967, and only a few vestiges of those days can
be seen, in the bars lining Sheridan Street and at the old Pioneer mine
head-frame on Shagawa Lake.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/ely_blue_heron_canoe.jpg" alt="Canoeists push off into the BWCA in Ely." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Guests of the Blue Heron B&B push off into South Farm Lake, on the edge
of the Boundary Waters.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The two groups didn't mix with the canoe crowd that now surges through
the streets. But many thought the antipathy had faded until August 2007,
when five men and a teen-ager entered the Boundary Waters in motorboats
and terrorized as many as 80 campers with threats and rifle fire.</p>
<p>Ely's complex political and natural history make it perhaps the most
interesting vacation area in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Many forces have left their mark here. From a pontoon boat, retired
science teacher Emily Wahlberg pointed them out on 12-mile-long
Burntside Lake, one of the region's biggest and most beautiful with 125
islands.</p>
<p>There's Indian Island, home of a large Ojibwe family and now populated
only by spirit houses, and Polka Dot Island, which made a memorable
appearance in the Hamm's beer &quot;Land of Sky-Blue Waters&quot; commercial.</p>
<p>Beer makers loved Ely; Grain Belt featured the glowing orange Cabin 26
at Burntside Resort in its ads.</p>
<p>Leisure Island was the summer retreat of Wisconsin tycoon Martin
Pattison, whose winter home, the 1890 Fairlawn Mansion in Superior, is
more famous. Old saunas can be seen along one stretch of shore, built by
the Finns who were the earliest settlers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>To the south, Sigurd Olson's famous Listening Point is marked by a
plaque on the black, lichen-covered volcanic rock that slides cleanly
into the water.</p>
<p>Only the most tenacious trees and mosses cling to the few inches of soil
atop the greenstone and granite outcroppings that form most of the
islands and much of the shore. Wahlberg explained how the glaciers
scraped away the softer rock and deposited the till in southern
Minnesota and Iowa.</p>
<p>&quot;They got the sweet corn, and we got the scenery,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>In Hoist Bay, the rusted boiler of the logging tug Bull of the Woods
pokes out of the water. Logging, Wahlberg said, took away more than
trees.</p>
<p>&quot;There used to be caribou herds here,&quot; she says. &quot;But logging took
away the forest canopy, replacing it with brush, which brought in deer
who had brain-worm disease.&quot;</p>
<p>By the time she was through, the quiet lake seemed populated with
ghosts. But Wahlberg said many of her passengers listen with half an ear
while looking at the shoreline with covetous eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;There's one question I'm always asked,&quot; she said: &quot; 'Do you
know of any property for sale?' &quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/ely_molter_museum.jpg" alt="The Dorothy Molter Museum in Ely." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The cabin of Dorothy Molter, the "root-beer lady," was moved out of
the Boundary Waters to Ely, where it's a museum.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Ely's blue lakes, shimmering off the computer screen, exert a magnetic
pull on visitors from all over the world: canoe-toting youth groups from
the South, Japanese tourists fresh from the Mall of America;
stressed-out Hollywood executives who have to be coaxed to relax.</p>
<p>And many, having first come to Ely to play, then decide to stay.</p>
<p>&quot;The majority of the entrepreneurs in Ely have come from somewhere
else; I'd go so far as to say 95 percent,&quot; said longtime innkeeper
Jo Kovach, a native who returned after her children were grown so she
could have &quot;a million-acre front yard&quot; in Ely.</p>
<p>&quot;They've chosen to leave behind the big city and come here. It's a
very unusual small town-we have more Ph.D.s than in most college
towns, though they might be swabbing toilets.&quot;</p>
<p>The main draw still is the pristine waters and forests. But the town,
pop. 3,400, is a destination in itself.</p>
<p>The International Wolf Center, opened in 1993, explores the symbolic
power of the wolf on human folklore-from Little Red Riding Hood to
the Three Little Pigs-and the social dynamics among wolves, once
exterminated in every state except Minnesota and Alaska.</p>
<p>Its biggest draws are the resident wolves, who live in a wooded
enclosure next to the center but can be watched from a glass-walled
viewing room.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/ely_wolf_center.jpg" alt="A wolf at Ely's International Wolf Center." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A wolf prowls its enclosure at the International Wolf Center.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>People come by the thousands to learn about pack dynamics and also to
join hikes into the woods, to see abandoned dens, to learn how to howl
and to find out how researchers track and study wolves.</p>
<p>Down the road, another museum sits in a grove of red pines. Its two
cabins were dragged by dog sled from Knife Lake, near the Canadian
border, after the 1986 death of Boundary Waters legend Dorothy Molter.</p>
<p>Molter, a Chicago nurse who came to Ely in 1930, was the last person
allowed to live within the BWCA, supporting herself by brewing root
beer, which she gave to passing canoeists for donations.</p>
<p>Today, the legend lives on at the museum in a video featuring the feisty
outdoorswoman, &quot;Dorothy Molter, Root Beer Lady.&quot; The bottles she
used and reused now are collector's items.</p>
<p>And everyone ends up in downtown Ely. On Sheridan Street is a trinity
that few visitors miss-Front Porch Coffee &amp; Tea, a popular breakfast
stop; Piragis Northwoods Co., a store and outfitter; and the Brandenburg
Gallery.</p>
<p>Along with Arctic explorers Will Steger and Paul Schurke, photographer
Jim Brandenburg is Ely's most famous citizen; his outrageously
beautiful portraits of lake country have done their bit to bring the
adoring masses to Ely.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Sheridan is thick with outfitters and apparel shops. This is the place
to gird for cold weather-with laced moosehide boots from the
elegant, high-ceilinged Steger Mukluks store, or a fleece anorak from
Wintergreen Northwoods Apparel.</p>
<p>Both shops sell through catalogs, which help them survive the long Ely
winters.</p>
<p>The main street for the locals is a block away, paralleling Sheridan.
Chapman Avenue is a shopping street, too, mostly for necessities, but it
also includes little nooks that sell espresso, artisan cheeses, antiques
and books.</p>
<p>But on a beautiful day, few want to hang around town.</p>
<p>Hiking trails surround Ely. There's a six-mile loop along the side of
Bass Lake, which dropped 60 feet in 1925.</p>
<p>The five-mile Secret-Blackstone Trail winds around three lakes, often on
greenstone. Closer to civilization, the Trezona Trail is a five-mile
asphalt path around Miners Lake, just north of downtown.</p>
<p>Those who want to camp in the Boundary Waters need to obtain a permit,
often far in advance for peak times at popular entries.</p>
<p>But permits for day use are easily obtained at any outfitter; one of the
most popular day trips is to the Hegman Lake pictographs, red-ocher
Indian paintings on a lakeside cliff not far from the Echo Trail.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/ely_hegman_pictographs.jpg" alt="Hegman Lake pictographs in Ely." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Ancient pictographs can be seen along North Hegman Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Other non-BWCA lakes, such as picturesque Burntside, have public boat
launches, or resorts that rent canoes from their marinas.</p>
<p>The 1913 Burntside Lodge, whose burnt-orange log cabins likely are the
most photographed in Minnesota, is an easy jumping-off spot for canoe
trips across the lake and up the Dead River, which is named for an
Indian cemetery and nearby village and has two scenic campsites.</p>
<p>There's more than enough to do. On a lovely evening in July, Karl and
Sherri Dybdal of Minneapolis were celebrating their anniversary in the
dining room of Burntside Lodge.</p>
<p>The couple travel to Ely every year and had spent the day, as usual,
hiking and fishing for bass in Burntside Lake.</p>
<p>&quot;In Ely, we never say, 'Geez, that was boring,' &quot; Karl Dybdal
noted. &quot;It just doesn't happen.&quot;</p>
