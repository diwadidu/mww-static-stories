<p>Over the centuries, waves of history have buffeted Madeline Island and
given it as many variations as a Lake Superior agate.</p>
<p>This wooded island off Wisconsin's Bayfield Peninsula, the largest of
the 22 Apostle Islands, exerts a magnetic pull.</p>
<p>The Ojibwe came from the east, led to &quot;food that grows on water&quot; —
wild rice — by a cowrie shell in the sky, according to their origin
mythology,</p>
<p>French fur traders followed and established the first fort in 1693.
Rival Protestant and Catholic missionaries built the first churches and
schools in the 1830s.</p>
<p>Well-to-do families from St. Paul and Nebraska built the first cottages
in the 1890s, and their descendants and friends summer there still.</p>
<p>Now, thousands of vacationers and day-trippers come over each summer on
ferries from Bayfield. Many head for rented cottages, melting into the
woods that cover most of the 14-mile-long island.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The day-trippers bring bikes and take off on the quiet roads, or explore
La Pointe by foot. La Pointe was a hub of the fur trade, a center of
civilization when the rest of the Great Lakes region was frontier.</p>
<p>Now, it's a few blocks of little cafes and shops on either side of the
dock, plus a museum, arts center and two small motels. In middle age,
it's a place whose laid-back atmosphere attracts free spirits from all
over.</p>
<p>Bulletin boards in the shops and cafes announce a bird-watching hike in
the Wilderness Preserve, Irish music at the cafe and a concert by
members of the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, up for the annual music
camp.</p>
<p>There might be a folk trio at Tom's Burned Down Cafe and a loom-making
workshop at the Art Guild.</p>
<p>The Fourth of July is one of the best times to be on the island, which
hosts a 1950s-style event that also evokes the pioneering 1850s, the
fur-trading 1750s and a Brigadoon-like epoch that reappears yearly and
is best described as Island Time.</p>
<p>It's the perfect expression of this little island, a historic crossroads
where old money, new money and no money happily co-exist during the
halcyon days of summer.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madeline_island_sandcastles.jpg" alt="Judging a sandcastle competition." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

State Park.

<p>From the yacht club comes peewee pirates; the wilderness-preserve
association sends bumblebees in yellow tulle. A chef waves a spatula,
teens from the music camp wave violin bows, an emu waves its long neck
and children wave American flags.</p>
<p>Others wear papier-mache masks, puppets and costumes made at free,
drop-in workshops at the Art Park, across from Tom's Burned-Down Café.</p>
<p>The parade always winds up on the lawn of the Madeline Island Historical
Museum, where the  Declaration of Independence is read and Big Top
Chautauqua founder Warren Nelson leads the crowd in &quot;America the
Beautiful&quot; and Woody Guthrie's &quot;This Land Is Your Land.&quot;</p>
<p>Tom's Burned-Down Cafe is one part of island tradition, separated from
the stars only by a bit of the old Big Top Chautauqua tent.</p>
<p>It's a folk venue and art salon, and sculptures from past
steel-wrestling festivals adorn the lawn. Inside, hand-drawn placards
provide commentary: &quot;Normal is a setting on a washing machine.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's another face of the island down the road at the yacht club,
where some of the gleaming white vessels surpass ostentation.</p>
<p>They're only a few yards from the rustic old mission cemetery, where
gravestones bear Ojibwe and French names and also modern offerings of
pennies, trading cards, bead necklaces, tobacco.</p>
<p>There are shin-high spirit houses and the graves of Chief Buffalo,
negotiator of the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe, and Michel Cadotte, the fur
trader and first settler whose Ojibwe wife gave the island its name.</p>
<p>It's a wonderful place to think about the past, but the Bad River Band,
to whom the cemetery was deeded by the Catholic Church, has closed off
access.</p>
<p>The cemetery, along with 200 acres now leased to cottagers, is all the
Ojibwe have left on the island, and that's a sore point.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had traditionalists visit who say the whole island is sacred,
and eventually it will return to the Ojibwe people,&quot; says Steve
Cotherman, director of the Madeline Island Historical Museum.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madeline_island_spirit_house.jpg" alt="A spirit house on Madeline Island." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The superb museum, run by the State Historical Society of Wisconsin,
ties the strands of history together with photos and words of all those
who have come to the island, from picnickers with parasols to the
Ojibwe, who said, &quot;All the gifts the Creator gave our people were
here.&quot;</p>
<p>Circling around the island, visitors find Big Bay State Park, whose long
sand beach curves gracefully into a crescent, Caribbean-style, facing
nothing but a long blue stretch of Lake Superior.</p>
<p>It looks enticing, but swimmers who dash in before late July, or even
August, learn to dash out fast, before they can feel the cold.</p>
<p>At the north end of the beach, there are warmer waters at the lagoon of
Big Bay Town Park, as well as campsites and canoe rentals for
wildlife-watching in wetlands. On the south end of the beach, state-park
trails lead hikers onto sandstone cliffs and ledges.</p>
<p>As a homeland, Madeline was bountiful, providing fish and protection
from enemies. As a vacation spot, its attributes are more ephemeral, but
just as appreciated.</p>
