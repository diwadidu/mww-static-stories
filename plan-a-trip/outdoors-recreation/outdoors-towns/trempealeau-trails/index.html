<h2>There's a lot to do in this Mississippi River hamlet in southwest Wisconsin.</h2>

From the top of Brady's Bluff, hikers can see as far north as Winona.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>All kinds of paths cross in the Wisconsin village of Trempealeau.</p>
<p>Canoes and cormorants, tugboats and trains, bicyclists and blues fans
all are drawn toward this Mississippi River town. It's just a little
burg, but it's smack in the middle of Mother Nature's playground.</p>
<p>Perrot State Park starts at the end of Trempealeau's First Street, with
hiking trails that give vistors spectacular views of far-off Winona, the
river valley and a hill French explorers called La Montagne Qui Trempe a
l'Eau, or &quot;the mountain that soaks in the water.&quot;</p>
<p>To the north are the sloughs of Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge,
crossroads for birds and springboard for bicyclists.</p>
<p>The Great River State Trail starts there and heads south, through town
and into Brice Prairie and the bottomlands of the Upper Mississippi
River Wildlife and Fish Refuge.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's great canoeing here, where the Black River empties into the
Mississippi. Farther up, in Van Loon Wildlife Area, hikers can walk in
Amazonian isolation along the four-mile McGilvray Road trail, where five
rare bowstring-arch bridges cross red-tinted streams.</p>
<p>And the hub for all this activity is the 1871 Trempealeau Hotel, which
was a bar when two La Crosse men stumbled into it in 1985 after skiing
at Perrot State Park. It was rundown, but it had rows and rows of
windows overlooking the Mississippi.</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't get it out of my little brain,&quot; said Jim Jenkins, the
now-retired historical preservationist who bought the hotel with his
friend, Bill King. &quot;It was just too beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>They replaced the Grain Belt with microbrews and the Beer Nuts with
walnut burgers and alfalfa sprouts.</p>
<p>Then they decided to bring in live music. They used a friend's hay wagon
as a stage, and Country Joe MacDonald became the first in a long line of
outdoor performers.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/trempealeau_hotel.jpg" alt="The Trempealeau Hotel." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Trempealeau Hotel is famous for its walnut burgers and a porch that
faces the Mississippi.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Jenkins sold the hotel in 2012 to Amy Werner, who had worked at the
hotel while a young student at UW-La Crosse. And the music continues.</p>
<p>May and early June are great times to explore the Upper Mississippi, so
I've been in town for the Blues Bash and Reggae Fest, where bands play
to the accompaniment of tugboat horns and whistles from trains
thundering by just yards away.</p>
<p>Musicians play on a picturesque little covered stage, flanked by pink
peonies against a white picket fence. Fans listen in the shade of a big
juniper and weeping willows, while children make sand castles on the
volleyball court.</p>
<p>Once, I treated myself to a birthday weekend in the Doc West House,
overlooking the music grounds and river. On my first morning, I rode my
bike along the river, past the stone ruins of the Melchior brewery, left
over from a cataclysmic fire in 1888, and into Perrot State Park.</p>
<p>Just inside the park is the post of Nicholas Perrot, a French fur trader
who spent the winter of 1685-86 &quot;at the foot of the mountain behind
which was a great prairie abounding in wild beasts.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I climbed that mountain, at 520 feet one of the tallest bluffs on the
Mississippi, and was rewarded with a magnificent view. The towers and
domes of Winona gleamed 15 miles to the north, and below was Trempealeau
Mountain, rising out of the water on a collar of limestone.</p>
<p>This island mountain and the adjoining bluffs were on the Minnesota side
until the end of the last Ice Age, when silty meltwaters blocked the
river's route and forced it to find a new channel.</p>
<p>From my aerie atop Brady's Bluff, eye to eye with lazily circling turkey
vultures, I also saw what the last 100 years had wrought. Silos dotted
the Minnesota blufftops and the Wisconsin flats.</p>
<p>Pontoons and speedboats sped by as a barge nosed its way down river. A
freight train rumbled over the water of Trempealeau Bay on a narrow
dike.</p>
<p>It was one of these railroad dikes that created Trempealeau Wildlife
Refuge. When workers were driving bridge pilings in 1857, they couldn't
find bottom and had to put the tracks farther north.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/trempealeau_flower_hillside.jpg" alt="Wildflowers in Trempealeau." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In May, jeweled shooting stars cover the side of Brady's Bluff.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The dikes they left protected the wetlands from river sediment and
pollution, forming a refuge for migrating waterfowl. And the tracks,
many years later, became one of Wisconsin's most scenic bike trails.</p>
<p>From the park, I rode onto the Great River State Trail and into the
quiet refuge. There, the trail follows four miles of the Prairie's Edge
Wildlife Drive, with 11 stations and a wooden observation deck on the
river.</p>
<p>But the best sights can be seen while riding: a great blue heron,
elegantly lifting off from a slough. Hillsides covered with purple
lupine and wild rose. Turtles lined up on a fallen log.</p>
<p>The trail back into town is lined by meadows and the range of hazy blue
peaks around Trempealeau Bay. There's a marked canoe trail there and
also south of town, beyond Lock and Dam No. 6 at Long Lake Landing.</p>
<p>I had Trempealeau schoolteacher Al Bratberg, who ran a canoe service,
take me there the next day so I could paddle the 4Â½-mile Long Lake Canoe
Trail.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;About when you get nervous about not knowing where to go, there'll be
a little sign,&quot; he said, as I set off.</p>
<p>A heavy silence hung over the jungly backwater, and the air was filled
with dragonflies. A couple fishing in the shade told me to start looking
for bald eagles, but it was 90 degrees and they were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Soon I came into the Mississippi, just up river from a barge that loomed
in the horizon like an ocean liner.</p>
<p>I ducked back into the backwaters and rounded a corner past the eagles'
nest and into Big Marsh Lake, then through the lily pads and back.</p>
<p>It took only 2Â½ hours, but it was time that felt far removed from
civilization.</p>

<p>Back at the Trempealeau Hotel, the signs of the Blues Bash had
disappeared. Picnic tables were on stage where Cash McCall and Maurice
John Vaughn had played. A basketball hoop stood where blues acolytes had
danced under strands of Christmas lights, and bikes were parked all over
the grass.</p>
<p>But there was still a crowd gazing out at the river panorama over lagers
and fajitas, just around the corner from the hotel's vintage signs for
&quot;Peerless beer&quot; and &quot;Delicious food.&quot;</p>
<p>Thankfully, the important things don't change in Trempealeau.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Trempealeau in southwest Wisconsin</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : It's half an hour north of La Crosse.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : In early May, <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/perrot/">Perrot State
Park</a> is full of spring
ephemerals, including thousands of jeweled shooting stars, and
bird-watching is excellent.</p>
<p>Summer is nice, but bring insect repellent in the sloughs. Fall is
beautiful along the trails, and nearby orchards produce raspberries and
apples.</p>
<p><em>2022 events</em> : June, <a href="https://www.trempealeauhotel.com/event/">Reggae
Fest</a>. July 8-10, <a href="https://trempealeaulions.com/catfish-days-2/">Catfish

<p><em>Accommodations</em> : The <a href="https://www.trempealeauhotel.com/">Trempealeau
Hotel</a> has two attractive suites in
the newly renovated Doc West House next door, with whirlpool and gas
stove. Above the restaurant are eight comfortable rooms that share one
bath. Four motel rooms are near the dam.</p>
<p>Light sleepers who don't like train noise might prefer the nearby
<a href="http://www.littlebluffinn.com">Little Bluff Inn</a>. Some rooms have
small refrigerators, microwaves or kitchenettes.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/perrot/">Perrot State Park</a> has 104
campsites, 608-534-6409.</p>
<p><em>Dining</em> : The screened porch of the Trempealeau Hotel is the place to
be on a summer day. Try the famous walnut burgers and a microbrew.</p>
<p>Just down the road, next to Perrot State Park, <a href="http://sullivanssupperclub.com/">Sullivan's Supper
Club</a> also has a view of the river and
serves steaks, seafood, chops and ribs.</p>
<p>In town, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rivercafetrempealeau/">River
Cafe</a> serves hearty
breakfasts and lunches.</p>
<p><em>Bicycling</em> : From Wisconsin 35, the northern trailhead of the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/greatriver/">Great
River State Trail</a> is
reached via the Marshland access of the Trempealeau National Wildlife
Refuge, 8Â½ miles north of Trempealeau. The surface is finely crushed
limestone pressed into hard dirt.</p>

<p>Trail passes cost $5 daily, $25 annual. In Onalaska, the Great River
trail connects with the La Crosse River Trail, which connects with the
Elroy-Sparta and 400 trails to provide 101 miles of trails.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.heron.bike/">Coulee Bicycle Company</a> offers service in
Onalaska.</p>
<p><em>Canoeing</em> : The marked 4Â½-mile <a href="https://www.fws.gov/uploadedFiles/Long%20Lake%20Canoe%20Trail%20(2011).pdf">Long Lake Canoe
Trail</a>
is part of the Upper Mississippi National Wildlife and Fish Refuge.</p>
<p>From Wisconsin 35 in Trempealeau, go south on Fremont Street (Lake Road)
and continue past the railroad tracks for 1Â½ miles. The Long Lake Boat
Landing marks the beginning and end of the canoe trail.</p>
<p>Canoes can be rented at Perrot State Park, which has marked a 2Â½- to
3-hour canoe trail in Trempealeau Bay.</p>
<p><em>Hiking</em> : For a great loop in Perrot State Park, take the West Bluff
Trail, lined with woodland flowers, up to Brady's Bluff. Return on the
East Bluff Trail, lined with prairie flowers, and the Riverview Trail.</p>
<p>The four-mile <a href="http://www.7bridgesrd.org">McGilvray Road</a>, seven miles
east of Trempealeau, was a road to a town, now vanished, on the Black
River. It's off Amsterdam Prairie Road, reached from 35 east or 53
north.</p>
<p>It's also nice in winter. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/mississippi-winter/">Open sesame on the
sloughs</a>.</p>
