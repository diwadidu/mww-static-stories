<h2>On Lake Michigan, this beach town has a high IQ and refined appetites.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/traverse_city_beach.jpg" alt="The West Arm beach of Traverse City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Swimmers swarm to West Arm beaches.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At first glance, Traverse City seems like just another Lake Michigan
beach town.</p>
<p>It's a truly gorgeous one, for sure. There's sand as far as the eye
can see, wrapped around two vast bays. Everybody's playing beach
volleyball, paddling kayaks or swimming in water tinted three shades of
blue.</p>
<p>The view gets even better beyond the beach, on streets thick with
craft-beer taprooms, wineries, epicurean markets and so many fine
restaurants that Traverse City now is considered a top foodie town.</p>
<p>There's also an independent cinema, an opera house and the Interlochen
Center for the Arts, supplying world-class performing arts.</p>
<p>This bathing beauty is deeper than it looks. Call it a beach town with
benefits.</p>
<p>Traverse City even throws great parties. In early July, hundreds of
thousands of tourists descend on the town for its National Cherry
Festival, one of the state's biggest.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's an air show and a few well-known music acts, but it's really
just a small-town festival, with pie-eating and pit-spitting contests,
fun runs, a classic car show and, of course, a big parade.</p>
<p>Despite its outsized reputation, Traverse City is a town of only 15,000
people. It has four-star restaurants but also such homespun diners and
drive-ins as the Dairy Lodge, which is where I met resident Bob
Eichenlaub.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been fortunate to travel all over the world, and there's no
place like this,&quot; said Eichenlaub, who was getting ice cream with
visitors from out of town. &quot;I hesitate to tell people that; sometimes, I just
want to close the door.</p>
<p>&quot;It's still a small town, the people are friendly, and the food is
good. Say, have you been to Georgina's?&quot;</p>
<p>Then he stopped short, with a stricken look on his face.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my God,&quot; he said. &quot;I'd better just shut up.&quot;</p>
<p>Locals are torn about sharing such places as Georgina's, which was a Latin-Asian
hole in the wall. Because when word spreads, they get crowded out.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/traverse_city_theater.jpg" alt="The State Theatre in Traverse City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Front Street, the renovated State Theatre is a center for film and
the performing arts.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There are plenty of good eateries to go around, though. Some people
assume that New York City chef Mario Batali, who has a summer home
nearby and is vocal in his love for the area, inspired the local food
scene.</p>
<p>But as Eichenlaub notes, &quot;This (food scene) was cooking way before that.&quot;</p>
<p>Traverse City sits at the base of two lobes of Grand Traverse Bay. They
create the Old Mission Peninsula and the Leelanau Peninsula, two
water-wrapped fingers of gravelly, well-drained land that's perfect for
growing things.</p>
<p>Early farmers grew apples and potatoes and sent them to Chicago and
Kansas City. Then cherries became big business, and now there's a new
generation of gentlemen farmers growing hops for craft beer, rye for
whiskey and grapes for wine.</p>
<p>And with the spirits has come an enhanced appreciation for fresh,
locally produced fare.</p>
<p>&quot;For its size, Traverse City has such an amazing food culture,&quot; says
local foodie Lysa Gudz.</p>
<p>&quot;It's partly because we've got the whole variety of everything in the
food cycle, and also because everyone within this whole cycle knows each
other. They want to create the best ingredients and best products they
can, because they'll be selling to people they know will continue to be
their customers.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/traverse_city_commons.jpg" alt="The Village at Grand Traverse Commons." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Village at Grand Traverse Commons once was a state mental asylum.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I started my tour along Front Street, the main avenue through downtown.</p>
<p>My first stop was Burritt's Market, where I sampled smoked salmon
jerky, chicken jalapeno sausage, Spanish olive oil with bread and three
kinds of spreads — a whitefish dip being the local standard for when
friends drop by.</p>
<p>The place is a palace for picnickers, a temple of nibbles and noshes.
Tourists don't frequent the market much, said employee Stephanie Snook,
but locals do.</p>
<p>&quot;I get a lot of hugs,&quot; she said. &quot;It's crazy; you go into a bar, and
it's &quot;Oh, you're the Burritt's girl!&quot;</p>
<p>From there, I stopped by the Grand Traverse Pie Company, famous for its
cherry crumb pie, and, across the street, Folgarelli's Market, which
sells wine, meat, cheeses and handmade pierogies.</p>
<p>In a former candy factory, North Peak Brewing Co. brews stouts, porters
and IPAs, one of nearly a dozen microbreweries, brewpubs and taprooms
around town.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>This neighborhood west of downtown, known as Slabtown, was settled by
Bohemian woodworkers who worked in the sawmills and brought home
leftover boards for their homes.</p>
<p>Many assimilated quickly and became cherry farmers, bringing their
produce to the big canning factory in what is now Clinch Park.</p>
<p>This was working-class Traverse City and still is home to Little Bohemia
tavern, Lehto's Pasties, Slabtown Burgers and Sleder's Family Tavern,
which is adorned with mounted animal heads and still has the &quot;snug&quot;
where women could get a beer without mingling with men.</p>
<p>The houses here are well-kept and adorable, though no longer owned by
factory workers. Some, including the distinctive Aberdeen Stone Cottage
B&amp;B, are made of thousands of round cobblestones.</p>
<p>Keep going west, and you'll hit Division Street and the family-run
Dairy Lodge, known for the Santa-capped blonde riding an ice-cream cone.
With Bardon's Wonder Freeze on the other end of town, it keeps Traverse
City well-supplied with malts, shakes and twist cones.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/traverse_city_volleyball.jpg" alt="Beach volleyball in Traverse City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
West End Park is popular for beach volleyball.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Head down Division, and you'll come to the winding driveway of Grand
Traverse Commons, once the Northern Michigan Asylum. Recruited by town
fathers to replace sawmill jobs, it was built with 8 million white
bricks in 1883-85 and had 42 buildings on 728 acres.</p>
<p>But it wasn't a &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; kind of
institution. Inmates apparently were content; an old postcard shows a
cuddling couple and the slogan &quot;A'm Not Luny, Just Spoony.&quot;</p>
<p>Each room had a window that opened to sunlight, and inmates were
encouraged to work outdoors on the sprawling campus, in greenhouses,
orchards and the farm, which included a world champion milk cow.</p>
<p>The complex closed in 1989 but was renovated and now holds luxury condos
on upper floors and restaurants, galleries and shops on the lower
levels.</p>
<p>Its wooded front lawn, once an arboretum, now is a gathering place.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Fine food is nearby, in old buildings pressed into new uses: at the
Pleasanton Brick Oven Bakery in the hospital's old fire house, at
Underground Cheesecake Factory in the old soap-making building, and at
Left Foot Charley Winery in the old laundry.</p>
<p>People use what they have in Traverse City, and what they have is not
only useful but attractive and scenic. The Boardman River, which flows
through downtown, once supplied power to the mills. Now, kayakers paddle
it between Lake Michigan and Boardman Lake.</p>
<p>The TART and Leelanau trails use old rail corridors, which bicyclists
ride from the East Arm to downtown and around the West Arm to Suttons
Bay. Five schooners and sloops sail from docks along its route.</p>
<p>Downtown, old brick storefronts are occupied by shoe shops, bookstores,
coffeehouses, a juice bar, jazz and martini bar and olive-oil and
vinegar bar.</p>
<p>At Cherry Republic, the omnipresent fruit is covered with chocolate and
put into jam, soda, salsa, cookies and trail mix — and the popular
shop is very generous with samples.</p>
<p>And across the street from each other, Doug Murdick's and Kilwin's
duke it out for the fudge-loving crowd.</p>
<p>In Traverse City, it's easy to find everything that makes life sweet.</p>

<p>East of town in Pere Marquette State Forest, the <a href="http://traversetrails.org/trail/vasa-pathway/">Vasa
Pathway</a> has four loops
— 3K, 5K, 10K and 25K — that can be used by hikers, mountain-bikers
and cross-country skiers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.traversecity.com/summer/things-to-do/shopping/">Shopping</a>:</strong> Downtown, Front Street is crammed with shops. There are more at Grand
Traverse Commons, just west of downtown off Division (U.S. 31) and 11th
streets.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.traversecity.com/lodging-5/">Accommodations</a>:</strong>  The
<a href="http://www.ihg.com/hotelindigo/hotels/us/en/traverse-city/tvcin/hoteldetail">Hotel

<p>Between the two bays, <a href="http://www.hojo.com/hotels/michigan/traverse-city/howard-johnson-of-traverse-city/hotel-overview">Howard
Johnson's</a>
is a good budget choice.</p>
<p>There are dozens of hotels and motels along U.S. 31 east of town, some
of which suffer from highway noise, so ask for a quiet room if you're
concerned. One of the best is <a href="http://www.cherrytreeinn.com/">Cherry Tree Inn &amp;

<p>If you're on a budget, stay in a dorm at <a href="https://www.nmc.edu/student-services/housing/summer-housing/index.html">Northwestern Michigan
College</a>.</p>
<p>It's at the foot of the Old Mission Peninsula, between the two arms of

<p>The park, connected to the beach by pedestrian overpass and to downtown
by the TART bicycle trail, gets very crowded in peak season.</p>
