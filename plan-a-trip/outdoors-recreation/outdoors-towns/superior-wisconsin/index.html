<h2>Scratch the surface of Superior and see it sparkle.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_superior_entry.jpg" alt="The Superior Entry Lighthouse." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>To most people, Superior, Wis., is nothing more than a series of traffic
lights to endure on the fast track to the Apostle Islands or Upper
Peninsula.</p>
<p>It's sprawling, ugly and utterly devoid of interest.</p>
<p>Or is it?</p>
<p>Like Duluth, Superior is a working-class town. Both grew up at the foot
of the big lake, Superior on the flats east of the St. Louis River and
Duluth on the hillsides to the northwest.</p>
<p>Superior had the only natural entry into the harbor and grew faster,
until Duluth got the first rail line and dug a harbor entry of its own.</p>
<p>Then antipathy grew between the Twin Ports, with each side calling the
other &quot;cliff dwellers&quot; or &quot;swamp jumpers.&quot;</p>
<p>Connected by bridges, both towns grew into prosperous cities,
flourishing on shipping, mining, logging and manufacturing until the
late 1960s, when both towns slid into a postindustrial funk.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Only one pulled itself out, turning its shabby lakefront into a tourist
attraction.</p>
<p>It wasn't Superior. Superior stayed rooted in the 1950s, at least on
the surface. Today, the retro look of its downtown is one of its
quirkier charms. Superior has many charms, but you have to look for
them.</p>
<p>&quot;Superior is laid out like a Kmart,&quot; says historian Tony Dierckins of Duluth, author of many books about the Twin Ports. &quot;There are things you want there,
but you can't tell by looking.&quot;</p>
<p>If you do look, you'll find Superior Municipal Forest, the third-largest
in the nation, honeycombed with scenic cross-country skiing and hiking
trails along St. Louis Bay.</p>
<p>At the end of Tower Avenue, the deceptively plain Anchor Bar is a dive
even a teetotaler could love; go two blocks more and you'll find Earth
Rider Brewery and its tied-house, the Cedar Lounge.</p>
<p>Wisconsin Point is the more serene sister of Duluth's Park Point, and
the S.S. Meteor whaleback on Barker's Island is the much-cooler cousin
of the S.S. William Irvin off Canal Park.</p>
<p>Though they're joined at the hip, now-glamorous Duluth and still-frumpy
Superior seem far apart. Some would like to close the gap: &quot;My T-shirt
says, 'It's Just a Bridge, Get Over It,' &quot; says Karin Kraemer.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/u/superior_dragonboats_kids.jpg" alt="Dragon boat races in Superior." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Children watch from the shore as dragon boats race from Barker's
Island.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But Superior is becoming less frumpy. Kraemer helped open the Red Mug
Espresso Bar in the North End Arts Gallery in the old 1890 city hall at
Broadway and Hammond.</p>
<p>Next door, the old police station houses arts studios. On the next
block, Thirsty Pagan Brewing serves up craft beer, pizza and live
music.</p>
<p>At the far end of Tower Avenue, Earth Rider Brewery maintains one of the
Twin Ports' busiest concert schedules.</p>
<p>In late August, the Lake Superior Dragon Boat Festival draws thousands
to Barker's Island, also one of the venues for the Duluth-Superior Pride Festival over Labor Day weekend. Barker's Island also has a sand beach on the bay, flanked by boardwalks lined with a beautiful prairie wildflower restoration.</p>
<p>Across from Barker's Island, the paved, five-mile Osaugie Trail takes bicyclists along the bay and past the massive Burlington Northern terminal, where the Edmund
Fitzgerald filled its hold with taconite for the last time.</p>
<h3>Home of a hero</h3>
<p>Now that I know where to look, I stop at favorite spots in Superior
instead of Duluth when I'm heading for northern Wisconsin. And one
February, my friend Jean and I made Superior our main destination.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Our first stop was across from Barker's Island, the Bong Veterans
Historical Center.</p>
<p>It tells the story of Richard Bong, the &quot;Ace of Aces&quot; who was a farm
boy in nearby Poplar when he first saw an airplane, bringing mail to
President Calvin Coolidge at his &quot;summer White House&quot; in Superior's
Central High School.</p>
<p>The center's elegant glass walls overlook a harbor from which six
shipbuilders launched 168 vessels between 1941 and 1945, and trains full
of Iron Range ore ran 24 hours a day on nine rail lines.</p>
<p>But Superior was in the limelight during the war for another reason: It
was the hometown of Maj. Richard Bong, the modest son of Swedish
immigrants who broke Eddie Rickenbacker's World War I record of 27 kills
and finally was forced to retire after completing 207 missions and
downing 40 enemy planes.</p>
<p>He was an international hero, and his 1945 marriage to Superior
sweetheart Marge Vattendahl was covered in newspapers worldwide.</p>
<p>When he died six months later while testing the first Lockheed jet
fighter, on the same day the Enola Gay dropped the atomic bomb on
Hiroshima, the lead headline in the Los Angeles Times was &quot;MAJOR BONG
KILLED!&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/u/superior_bicyclists_osaugie_trail.jpg" alt="Bicyclists pass the S.S. Meteor on Superior's Osaugie Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicyclists ride by the S.S. Meteor on the Osaugie Trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Below it, a much smaller headline read &quot;War's End Speeded as Powerful
New Atomic Bomb Rains Death, Destruction on Japan.&quot;</p>
<p>A duplicate of Bong's famous P-38 Lightning fighter, a portrait of Marge
on its nose, sits on the floor of the museum. Newsreel clips, films and
wall exhibits take visitors from Pearl Harbor to VJ Day.</p>
<p>From the Bong Heritage Center, we followed U.S. 2 for half an hour until
we came to the Afterhours Ski Trail in Brule River State Forest, just
outside Brule.</p>
<p>The Brule Valley Ski Club was holding its annual candlelight ski, and
for an hour we glided alongside the flickering lanterns, returning to
the warming shelter for hot chocolate.</p>
<h3>Beeline to a dive</h3>
<p>Back in Superior, we followed Tower Avenue north until the streetscape
grew dark and desolate. Finally, we saw a squat concrete-block building
sitting by itself: the fabled Anchor Bar and Grill.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Whoa, this looks like 'Enter at Your Own Risk,' &quot; Jean said.</p>
<p>But we pushed open the door and passed into an unusually congenial world
in which tattooed bikers, college students and skiers mingle amid a
jumble of marine relics-old life buoys, Coast Guard recruiting
banners, harbor lights, harpoons, an ancient scuba helmet, even a
bare-breasted mannequin wearing a gas mask.</p>
<p>John Wilking of St. Paul, a former UW-Superior student, was there with
his brother, Joseph. They'd arrived at 5 p.m. and worked their way up to
the bar's choicest table, the one with barber chairs.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes I like to sit in the stools up front and watch people come
in,&quot; Wilking said. &quot;Maybe two women like you, they'll walk in, look
around and walk right back out. But it has good energy. You see people
here from 21 to their 70s; it's safe.&quot;</p>
<p>After they left, we grabbed the barber chairs, plugging the jukebox and
swiveling to look around as we ate the famously juicy burgers and
perfect fries and drank craft beers from a list that may be the best in
town.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/u/superior_fairlawn.jpg" alt="Fairlawn mansion in Superior." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Fairlawn Mansion was built by a lumber baron with a past.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>A lumber baron's mansion</h3>
<p>The next day, we drove back to the harbor, where Fairlawn Mansion
overlooks Barker's Island.</p>
<p>The 42-room Queen Anne home was built in 1891 by Martin Pattison, a
lumber baron from Michigan who made his real money mining veins of iron
ore he discovered himself in the Vermillion Range near Ely, Minn.</p>
<p>His house was the first grand residence in the Twin Ports, and he
lavished $150,000 on Guatemalan mahogany, English glazed tile, Mexican
onyx fireplaces and white-birch woodwork covered with 22-karat gold.</p>
<p>&quot;When it was built, it was in the news every day,&quot; said Jason Nummi,
our tour guide. &quot;It was a big affair.&quot;</p>
<p>But Martin Pattison was no Chester Congdon, the upright son of a
Methodist minister who built Duluth's grand residence, 39-room
Glensheen, between 1905 and 1908.</p>
<p>Pattison had a skeleton in his closet, and she came back to haunt him
while he was serving as mayor of Superior.</p>
<p>He'd abandoned a wife and children in Michigan and changed his name
before marrying Grace Frink, whose grandmother's family pioneered
iron-ore companies on the Marquette Range. The other wife was news to
Grace.</p>
<p>&quot;Then they had separate bedrooms,&quot; Nummi said. &quot;After that, she looked
really cranky in photos.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/u/superior_entry_cort.jpg" alt="Freighter enters the Superior harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>After Martin's death in 1918, a year after he donated the 660 acres to
the south that became Pattison State Park, home of the fourth-highest
waterfall east of the Rockies, Grace Pattison donated the house for use
as an orphanage.</p>
<p>For the next 42 years, it served nearly 2,000 children, and an exhibit
upstairs contains reminiscences-some bitter, some grateful, some
philosophical-from those who once were &quot;those kids&quot; from the
orphanage.</p>
<p>Then the house was to be torn down, according to Grace Pattison's deed.
But the county historical society found a loophole and, thanks to the
heirs, moved in.</p>
<h3>Adventure on the trail</h3>
<p>From Fairlawn, Jean and I drove back along Belknap Street, also U.S. 2,
past the campus of UW-Superior, where politician-actor Arnold
Schwarzenegger earned a B.A. in 1979, with an emphasis on the
international marketing of fitness and business administration.</p>
<p>We'd never seen a photo of Schwarzenegger on skis, but he would have
gotten a good workout if he'd ever skied at Superior Municipal Forest,
our destination.</p>
<p>The wooded forest along St. Louis Bay has 26 kilometers of ski trails,
and we started with a spin through pine forest on the Purple Trail,
where we saw two deer, shaggy in their winter coats.</p>
<p>Then we took the more challenging Yellow Loop onto Dwight's Point
peninsula, skiing down the first screamer hill but using a bypass on the
second.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/u/superior_skate_skier.jpg" alt="A skier whizzes through Superior Municipal Forest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At Cedar Point, we skied right onto a frozen cove, from which we could
see the Bong Bridge and grain terminals off in the distance. A fawn
peeked at us through the cedars, then ambled toward us to nibble on
brush.</p>
<p>Like parts of Superior, the city forest is a real discovery. From now
on, I'll pay more attention when I drive through Superior. It may be
homely, but it harbors hidden treasures.</p>
