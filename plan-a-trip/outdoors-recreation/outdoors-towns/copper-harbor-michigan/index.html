<h2>Fortune-seekers left their mark at the tip of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula.</h2>

At the end of Brockway Mountain Drive, there's a panoramic view of
Copper Harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Copper Harbor, Mich., never has had an easy existence.</p>
<p>Indians and explorers always knew there was copper sitting along the
Keweenaw Peninsula. But the desolation of the area made mining
difficult.</p>
<p>The earliest expedition, sent by London investors in 1771, gave up in
disgust on an area Patrick Henry told Congress was &quot;beyond the most
distant wilderness and remote as the moon.&quot;</p>
<p>Lower Michigan had to be persuaded to take the Keweenaw and the rest of
the Upper Peninsula in 1836, when it was applying for statehood.</p>
<p>One opponent complained that the area, separated from Detroit by Lake
Michigan and nearly 600 miles, was nothing but &quot;20,000 square miles of
howling wilderness.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the new state's first geologist, Douglass Houghton, who in 1840
blasted the first copper and iron ore out of a spot near Copper Harbor,
which was at the tip of the peninsula and easiest to reach by water.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Houghton's surveys, plus tales of vast masses of pure copper-one of
the largest was more than 500 tons-spawned the copper rush of 1843.</p>
<p>In a few years, Copper Harbor was booming, with a hotel, newspaper and a
whole lot of saloons.</p>
<p>But soon nearby Eagle River became the boom town, and others after it,
with the fortunes funneling mainly to investors in the East. Settlers
arrived, tough people who were willing to put up with deprivation and
interminable winters.</p>
<p>Today, Copper Harbor is a quiet little resort village that unrolls for
tourists each June.</p>
<p>Even on a sunny summer day, there are reminders of its wildness: the
snow gauge on U.S. 41, showing a record annual fall of 32½ feet. Bears
glimpsed in the woods along the road. Merciless black flies, raising
ranges of welts along hairlines. Wrecked ships, blown onto the rocky
shore by Lake Superior gales.</p>
<p>In fact, Kate Holmes, bent over a washboard at Fort Wilkins, can tell
you just how tough life was.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/o/copper_harbor_lodge_cabin.jpg" alt="A cabin at Keweenaw Mountain Lodge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;It ain't so much the snow, but the isolation that can be the death
o' you,&quot; the laundress says in an Irish brogue.</p>
<p>Time has stood still at the lakeside fort, built in 1844 to handle
Indian hostility and mining strife that never materialized.</p>
<p>On the parade ground, a strutting Lt. Richard Muller drills visiting
children, who shout &quot;Yes, sir!&quot; to his harangues. Frau Margarethe
Baumann, another laundress, gives him a withering look.</p>
<p>&quot;He goes by the book, though we don't know what book that is,&quot; she
says, crushing plantain leaves to rub on our black-fly bites.</p>
<p>Sgt. Patrick O'Neill is sitting outside the bakery; he's a
&quot;temperance man&quot; who spends much of his time tracking down bored
soldiers in town saloons.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of the men here are waiting for their enlistments to run up,&quot;
he says wearily. &quot;The Army wants to reduce the ranks after the Civil
War.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Fort Wilkins wasn't a romantic place then, but it's fun to visit now.
The fort, abandoned in 1870, was restored by the WPA in the 1930s.
Costumed actors play real residents, and quarters are furnished as they
were in 1870.</p>
<p>The 1866 Copper Harbor Lighthouse also is part of Fort Wilkins State
Park, although it's closed to tourists because access is privately
owned.</p>
<p>A few blocks away, from a dock surrounded by gift shops, the Isle Royale
Queen III crosses to Isle Royale National Park, 50 miles across Lake
Superior.</p>
<p>Hikers heading for the wilderness island provide much of the traffic in
Copper Harbor; when the ferry returns in the evening, servers at the
adjacent Harbor Haus restaurant whistle a salute and dance a little
cancan.</p>
<p>Behind the village, Brockway Mountain Drive, the highest highway between
the Rockies and the Alleghenies, climbs a ridge above the lake.</p>
<p>We follow its undulating spine past spectacular views of inland lakes,
set deep within thick forests, and the big lake, sometimes with Isle
Royale on the horizon.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/o/copper_harbor_keweenaw_lodge.jpg" alt="children play at Keweenaw Mountain Lodge" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The drive ends 10 miles south in Eagle Harbor, another quiet village
where an 1871 lighthouse, now automated, holds museums on copper mining,
shipping and local history.</p>
<p>A freighter is passing in the nearby shipping lane, and a plaque on a
viewing deck explains how to tell a &quot;saltie&quot; from a laker. The snug
little harbor has a sandy beach, but even into July, children swim in
wetsuits.</p>
<p>This stretch of shore is lined with agate beaches and, seven miles
farther, the site of the first copper bonanza. The fabulous Cliff Lode
was discovered near Eagle River in 1845.</p>
<p>Two months later, on the jagged rocks offshore, 37-year-old Douglass
Houghton was caught in an open boat by a northeaster; the copper rush
went on without him.</p>
<p>Today, Eagle River is a fog-shrouded village with a waterfall, some
interesting old houses and 1866 Greek Revival courthouse.</p>
<p>There's a country store that's been around since 1867. It sells
homemade ginger cookies, saffron buns and books on Cornish history, plus
ice cream for the tourists.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Heading south on U.S. 41, lined with purple cow vetch and covered with
trees, we see a bear cub, lounging in the middle of the highway, then
wandering from stopped car to stopped car, each with drivers madly
fumbling for cameras.</p>
<p>Farther on, we encounter the remnants of copper fever: in Mohawk,
roadside stands peddling chunks of pure copper.</p>
<p>In Calumet, big buildings of red stone testify to a big past. In
Laurium, cafes sell meat-and-potato pasties the size of cantaloupes.</p>
<p>The Keweenaw Peninsula still is remote to residents of lower Michigan,
from which people up north occasionally threaten to secede. But the
wildness is almost, though not quite, a thing of the past.</p>

<p>Reserve as far in advance as possible. Since the boat leaves Copper
