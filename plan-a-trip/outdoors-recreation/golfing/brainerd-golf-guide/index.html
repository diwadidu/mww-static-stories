<h2>In Minnesota's golf mecca, there's a course for everyone to love.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/r/brainerd_craguns1.jpg" alt="Cragun's golf course." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Legacy courses at Cragun's were designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The days when the Brainerd area was best known for lakes are long gone.</p>
<p>Today, it has more golf holes than fishing holes-and there are 465
lakes within 25 miles of Brainerd, a railroad town that lends its name
to a swath of north-central Minnesota that includes the lakeside
villages of Nisswa, Breezy Point, Crosslake and Deerwood.</p>
<p>Golf Digest has ranked the Brainerd Lakes one of the Top 50 golf
destinations in the world, which is pretty good for real estate that
spends most of the year under snow.</p>
<p>For the average golfer, the Brainerd area has even more to offer than
destinations in Scotland, Florida and California. It has big-name
championship courses, such as The Classic at Madden's and Grand View's
Deacon's Lodge, which rank No. 42 and 52 on the magazine's list of
America's 100 Greatest Public Golf Courses.</p>
<p>But it also has plenty of family-style par-threes, friendly traditional
courses and bargain spots where greens fees are a buck a hole.</p>
<p>Whether you are a zero-handicap or a first-timer, there's something for
you.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Greens fees have risen well past $100 on the best-known courses. But
tee times have gone unsold in the weak economy, and virtually every
course offers early- and late-season discounts as well as discounted
twilight rates that start as early as 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Most of the courses have ambitious league and tournament schedules, and
usually, casual visitors are able to join in for an event or two.</p>
<p>It's a good time to be a golfer. Here's a guide to the best courses in
the Brainerd Lakes.</p>
<p>For more about vacationing in the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/brainerd-minnesota-summer/">The buzz on
Brainerd</a>.</p>
<h3>Championship courses</h3>
<p>Some of the best courses in the country have been built around Brainerd
in the last 15 years, and at the top of our list is <a href="http://www.maddens.com/?page=6032">The Classic at
Madden's</a> on Gull Lake, just north of
<strong>Brainerd</strong> .</p>
<p>Standing on the third tee early on a crisp morning, with the sun still
low in the sky and mist rising from water that stretches all the way to
the green, you understand not only why you love this course, but why you
love golf.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/maddens_classic_paul.jpg" alt="The Classic at Madden's Resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Explore Minnesota</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Classic at Madden's often is ranked the area's top course.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The Classic rolls through hundreds of acres of wetlands and woods with
creeks, lakes and waterfalls that make for a breathtaking experience.
The course is beautifully designed and impeccably maintained, so it's
not just another pretty face, but a great golf experience as well.</p>
<p>Local and national consultants helped Madden's course superintendent
Scott Hoffman with the details of the course design, but the vision was
his. It was a remarkable achievement, akin to a small local vintner
running off with all the blue ribbons at a wine competition.</p>
<p>One of the state's top teachers, Chris Foley, hangs his shingle here,
and a nifty clubhouse and restaurant complete the picture. The Classic
has a high price tag of $119 weekends, $105 weekdays, which tends to
reduce play, adding to the pristine condition of the course.</p>
<p>Discounts may be available in shoulder seasons, but the best rates come
with Madden's stay-and-play packages.</p>
<p>No. 2 on our list, but rated the favorite in our unofficial survey of
local pros, is <a href="http://www.grandviewlodge.com/golfcourses_deacons.asp">Deacon's
Lodge</a>  near <strong>Breezy
Point</strong>.</p>
<p>Designed by Erik Larson of the Arnold Palmer Design Company, Deacon's
added serious depth to the Brainerd golf scene when it opened in 1999.
The course features bent grass from tee to green with shaved approaches
and mounded greens that make high handicappers send 10-foot downhill
putts rolling 30 yards back into the fairway.</p>
<p>Built on 500 acres, it doesn't have
the back-and-forth feel you get at more traditional courses. From the
tee, every hole opens like a package at Christmas.</p>
<p>Deacon's Lodge is managed by the folks at Grand View Lodge, and there
are stay-and-play packages at cabins on-site as well as at Grand View in
Nisswa. Rates are $114 and $104, and rounds can be combined with the
other Grand View courses for discounts.</p>
<p>Our third selection is <a href="http://www.GolfGoldenEagle.com">Golden Eagle Golf
Club</a> in <strong>Fifty Lakes</strong>, and it
also came in third on our local pro survey.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The glaciers that pushed across Minnesota, gouging out lakes and
creating ridges, played into the hands of Golden Eagle designers Mike
Morley and Bruce McIntosh. In 2001, they used these dramatic elevation
changes, right in the middle of the lake country, to create the most
unusual and most playable course in the area.</p>
<p>On a clear day, you can stand on the seventh tee and see Brainerd and
Crosby, 30 miles to the south.</p>
<p>Golden Eagle is unlike resort courses in a couple of ways. It is
privately owned, so co-designer and managing partner Bruce McIntosh
probably will be greeting you when you walk into the clubhouse. And at
$85/$65, it is 20 percent less expensive than the other premium
courses on our list.</p>
<p>Leisurely 10-minute tee-time intervals help put Golden Eagle in the top
2 percent of courses nationally for pace of play. Stay-and-play packages
are available at Crosslake lodgings and an on-site cottage.</p>
<p>It's on the northeast edge of the Brainerd Lakes area, and worth the
drive.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/i/fifty_lakes_golden_eagle10.jpg" alt="Golden Eagle golf in Fifty Lakes." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Dramatic elevation changes make Golden Eagle the area's most unusual
course.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Tied for fourth and fifth are <a href="http://craguns.com/golf/index.html">The Legacy
Courses</a> <strong>at Cragun's</strong>
on Gull Lake, just north of <strong>Brainerd.</strong>
Both 18-hole courses, Bobby's Legacy and
The Dutch Legacy, were designed by second-generation legend Robert Trent
Jones Jr.</p>
<p>Virtually across County Road 77 from Madden's Classic, the 36 holes
swing and sway through woods and wetlands, with each new hole a puzzle
to be solved with brains, skill and a bit of luck. For a shining
example, look at No. 13 on The Dutch Legacy.</p>
<p>If you have never played a Jones-designed course, you will be astounded
at the sense of size and dimension of these layouts. The monstrous 149
slope from the back tees on Bobby's Legacy will get the attention of
people who play golf for a living.</p>
<p>While all area courses see their fair share of wildlife, the Legacy
courses, weaving through 1,000 acres, have received the first Audubon
Sanctuary designation in the state, and only the second in the country.</p>
<p>In 2009, The Dutch Legacy received Golf Digest's highest rating of five
stars, with Bobby's Legacy right behind at 4½ stars. That may have
contributed to their eye-popping mid-season 2010 rates of $125, but the
ranking also reflects continuing efforts to improve the course.</p>
<p>Stay-and-play packages bring green fees lower, as does twilight pricing.</p>
<p>No. 6 on the championship list is <a href="http://www.grandviewlodge.com/golfcourses_preserve.asp">The
Preserve</a>, just
south of <strong>Pequot Lakes</strong>. Designed by Dan
Helbling and Mike Morley and built as a free-standing course in 1996, it
was quickly acquired by Grand View Lodge.</p>
<p>When you arrive and get your first view of the course from the hilltop
clubhouse, you instantly get it. Beautiful elevation changes and a
tee-to-green carpet of bent grass, along with quirky but interesting
hole designs, define the type of experience you will have here.</p>
<p>With its location away from the &quot;home office&quot; of Grand View Lodge, the
vibe is a little more laid back and enjoyable. Rates are $104/$94 and
can be combined with other courses in a Grand View Lodge stay-and-play
package.</p>
<p>The No. 7 course on our list is Grand View's <a href="http://www.grandviewlodge.com/golfcourses_pines.asp">The
Pines</a>. Featuring
27 holes across the road from the main lodge in <strong>Nisswa</strong>,
The Pines is a benchmark of how golf
courses have changed in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>When opened in 1991, this Joel Goldstrand design was perhaps the top
public golf course in the state. It hasn't changed and remains a beauty,
with impeccable fairways and greens, as well as landscaping that would
fit nicely at the best private country clubs.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_view_pines2_paul.jpg" alt="Golfers on The Pines at Grand View." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Explore Minnesota</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Pines, across from Grand View Lodge, was among the first wave of
top-notch courses.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>While it may fall behind some of the newer neighbors in scope and drama,
it still should be on everyone's must-play list. Rates are $104/$94,
with rounds interchangeable with The Preserve in stay-and-play packages.
Deacon's Lodge rounds can be added for an extra fee.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ruttgers.com/activities/thelakes.htm">Lakes Course</a> at
Ruttger's Bay Lake Lodge in <strong>Deerwood</strong>,
near Crosby, comes in at No. 8 on our list. There have been golfers at
Ruttger's since they built their first course in 1921, and this Joel
Goldstrand design is only the latest version.</p>
<p>Like the Pines, this course is starting to show a few wrinkles when
compared to the more glamorous neighbors, but it remains a fun and
challenging romp around two lakes and thousands of trees.</p>
<p>A couple wayward blind shots will teach you to drive ahead for a look
before you swing, so the second time around the course is more fun.
Rates for this summer are $75/$55, with an assortment of stay-and-play
packages to fit almost anyone.</p>
<p>Our final championship course is the <a href="http://www.breezypointresort.com/golf/whitebirch/index.html">Whitebirch
Course</a> at
<strong>Breezy Point</strong>. The first of the area's
championship resort courses, it, too, is showing its age. A mile down
the road from the gates of Breezy Point Resort, it always has had a
&quot;Jurassic Park&quot; feel, with some spectacular holes on the back nine.</p>
<p>There are quite a few ordinary holes, too, but that is reflected in the
relatively low mid-season green fees of $64/$59. There are also some
very reasonable stay-and-play packages, and Antlers Restaurant in the
Whitebirch clubhouse is one of the best around.</p>
<h3>Traditional courses</h3>
<p>Unlike the championship courses, these do not include carts in their
rates.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.whitefishgolf.com">Whitefish Golf Club</a>  between <strong>Pequot Lakes
and Crosslake</strong> is our top course in this category, and
it's also one of the most popular courses in the area.</p>
<p>This member-owned course has a core of loyal followers who pony up for
unlimited-play memberships and then get their money's worth. Pro/manager
Steve Bengtson runs a professional but friendly operation and makes sure
his shareholders' money is reinvested wisely.</p>
<p>If you're a little crooked off the tee, don't leave your driver in your
bag, leave it at home. The mature stand of trees lining each fairway is
easy to get into and painfully hard to escape.</p>
<p>Be sure to call ahead for tee times and expect slower than average play
at popular times. Rates are $48 weekends, $38 weekdays plus cart, with
plentiful junior and senior discounts.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cuyunacountryclub.com">Cuyuna Country Club</a> in Deerwood</strong>
is the perfect example of a nine-hole
course that was built 75 years ago as a town gathering spot and then, in
1988, expanded to 18 holes.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/r/crosslake_crosswoods8.jpg" alt="The eighth hole at Crosswoods." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The eighth hole of Crosswoods Golf Course in Crosslake skirts state
forest.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Now, it is a laid back enclave of retirees and locals who are happy to
welcome visitors with $39/$20 green fees and a no-nonsense,
well-maintained classic course. You won't rave about the course when
you're finished, but it's the kind of place that makes you happy you
played there.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.maddens.com/?page=6036">Pine Beach East</a> and <a href="http://www.maddens.com/?page=6037">Pine Beach
West</a> at <strong>Madden's resort</strong>
are less-intense and lower-pressure golf
experiences than the big resort courses. Pine Beach East dates back to
the 1920s and offers a nice variety of holes, including a 600-yard-plus
par 6).</p>
<p>With the back tees at a friendly 6,100 yards, it is popular with locals
from around Gull Lake as well as resort guests. Pine Beach West is even
shorter and a great place for families, or anyone who would just like a
fun three-hour outing.</p>
<p>Green fees for the courses are reasonable at $45 (East) and $34
(West), but there are stay-and-play packages that can reduce the rate to
zero. Both courses share a professional groundskeeping crew and
superintendent with The Classic.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eagleslanding-golf.com">Eagles Landing</a> is the course you
see as you drive up Minnesota 371, about 15 miles south of <strong>Brainerd</strong>.
There is a lot of visible mounding that
gets your attention, but wait until you actually have to deal with it on
No. 18 . . . and that's before you get to the double-depth green.</p>
<p>Eagles Landing is relatively new and will continue to improve, but for a
6,800-yard course at $22 plus cart, you can't go wrong. It's a great
stop on your way to or from Brainerd.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crosslakegolf.com">Crosswoods Golf Course</a> in <strong>Crosslake</strong>
leads you through the woods along the edge
of state-forest lands on the front nine and then glides you along the
soft backside of town on the back nine.</p>
<p>Operated for years as a par-29 nine-holer, the next generation of the
Stone family has expanded and improved the layout over the last decade.
A 2008 clubhouse addition, with continued on-course improvements in
2010, make this facility a very nice option.</p>
<p>Rates are $32/$27, but there are endless discount and coupon options.</p>
<p><a href="http://breezypointresort.com/golf/traditional/index.html">The Traditional Golf
Course</a> at
<strong>Breezy Point Resort</strong> has a long and storied
history that matches the colorful background of the resort itself. At a
short 5,000 yards, you can visualize Katharine Hepburn types walking the
fairways in knickers while sipping martinis with a half-dozen friends.</p>
<p>It may not be serious golf, but it might be a heck of a party. Rates are
$36/$32.50 with a long list of discount options.</p>
<h3>Bargain courses</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.emilygreens.com">Emily Greens</a> is another expanded
nine-hole, par 3 course that now is a 5,000-yard, par 65 course of 18
holes. Located just west of <strong>Emily</strong> on
County Road 1, northeast of Crosslake, it claims to have Minnesota's
largest green.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/m/emily_golf17.jpg" alt="The golf course in Emily." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Emily Greens, near Emily, claims the state's largest green.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Green fees are listed at $26/$22, but the web site includes coupons
and other deals that can lower the rate to as low as $10 for unlimited
play. It's a nice family outing and a good place to sign up for a group
event.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinerivercountryclub.com">Black Bear Golf Course</a> north of
<strong>Pine River</strong> allegedly was carved out of the
Bristow family farm by Grandpa Cal, as was the Pine River Country Club,
a little to the southwest.</p>
<p>The course hasn't changed much since its farm days, but it's a fun
place to swing away with abandon. Rates haven't been published, but you
can bet on something in the range of a buck a hole.</p>
<h3>Nine-hole courses</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.pinerivercountryclub.com">Pine River Country Club</a> in <strong>Pine
River</strong> is the most traditional of the
nine-hole courses in the area, although it's added an executive nine to
the 3,400-yard, par 36 layout.</p>
<p>In the process, it added three new holes that have yet to mature. At
peak pricing of $16/$13 for nine holes, it probably is priced about
right.</p>
<p>Cragun's, Madden's, Grand View and Ruttger's all offer nine-hole
short-course options in addition to their full-size courses. They are
mostly there as companion courses for warm-up or cool-down, but they are
available for family and resort guest play.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ruttgers.com/activities/alecsnine.htm">Alec's 9</a> at
<strong>Ruttger's Bay Lake</strong> and <a href="http://www.grandviewlodge.com/golfcourses_garden.asp">The Garden
Course</a> at <strong>Grand
View</strong> are old school, <strong>Madden's</strong> <a href="http://www.maddens.com/?page=6038">Social
Nine</a> is what it says, and <strong>Cragun's</strong>
put some effort and interest in its par-3
<a href="http://craguns.com/golf/reversible.html">Reversible Nine</a>.</p>
<p>Expect to pay about $15 to play one of these courses, but they may be
free, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>If you want the perfect place to take the kids, check out <a href="http://wildwedge.com">Wildwedge
Family Golf Park</a> just north of <strong>Pequot Lakes</strong>.
It's a cute little par-3 course with
kid's tees, or you can opt for a very nice mini-golf option.</p>
<p>Top rates are $13/$11 and even cheaper with coupons, two-for-ones and
age discounts. You might even try your hand at night golf, but bring the
bug spray.</p>
<p>The <strong>Fairways at Howard's Barn</strong> is a <strong>Fifty Lakes</strong> fixture with a no shirt/no
shoes/no worries attitude. The wooden cow on the driving range will give
you an indication of what conditions to expect, but if you just want to
be a little goofy, this is your spot. The bar can be fun, too.</p>
