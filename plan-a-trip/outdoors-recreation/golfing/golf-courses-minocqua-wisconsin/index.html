<h2>For nearly a century, golfers have relished the woods and lakes between Sayner and Rhinelander.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minocqua_timber__ridge.jpg" alt="Timber Ridge near Minocqua." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Timber Ridge</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Timber Ridge near Minocqua, the signature 16th hole is studded with
railroad ties and sand.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The woods and waters of north central Wisconsin offer some of the best
vacation opportunities in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Stretching from Hayward in the west to Minocqua in the east, you will
find fishing, boating, swimming, hiking, snowmobiling, cross-country
skiing and Friday fish fries.</p>
<p>There's also a little bar at nearly every intersection — sometimes,
two.</p>
<p>The area has a long history of golf, dating to the opening of the Plum
Lake course in Sayner in 1912.</p>
<p>Where Hayward is boisterous and brash, Minocqua is relaxed and
comfortable. Its cross-state rival claims the world's largest musky, the
world's best hamburger, the world's best 10-hole golf course, the
Lumberjack World Championships and the title of Wisconsin's Golf
Capital.</p>
<p>Minocqua has almost twice as many residents, but folks there temper
their boasts with a bit of Midwestern humility.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Cleverly nicknamed the Island City, downtown Minocqua sits squarely in
the middle of Lake Minocqua, crossed by two bridges that carry travelers
on U.S. 51.</p>
<p>Hayward is a quick 2½-hour drive from the Twin Cities, but the Milwaukee
and Chicago folks who vacation in Minocqua need 4½ to 6½ hours to get
there.</p>
<p>Perhaps that defines the two towns' personalities, as visitors to the
Minocqua area tend to stay longer and are more able to develop a
vacation inner peace.</p>
<p>Though it doesn't hold the Golf Capital title, it did wrest the Musky
Capital of the World trademark back
from Hayward, after a protracted legal tussle.</p>
<p>And the Minocqua area gives its counterpart a run for its money with
stylish, high-quality golf courses between the historic Plum Lake in the
north to the beefy Northwood municipal course in Rhinelander, to the
south.</p>
<p><em>Rhinelander</em> is more businesslike than Minocqua. With its Wisconsin
River location, it has some industry and a bigger-city vibe. The
city-owned <a href="http://www.northwoodgolfclub.com">Northwood Golf Club</a> was
designed by Don Herfort and opened for play in 1989.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stgermain_golf_5.jpg" alt="St. Germain's golf course." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the well-run St. Germain Golf Club, No. 5 is the beginning of a
gorgeous stretch of fairway.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This is not your normal muni-course. This is a professional, big-time
golf course stretching more than 6,700 yards, with a first-class bar and
restaurant, practice facility and GPS on the golf carts.</p>
<p>Golf Digest has awarded the course its second-highest ranking, 4½ stars,
and named it one of the best municipal course in the country.
That makes peak rates for walking a relative steal.</p>
<p>As you line up the tee shot on the par-3 11th hole, you will notice
tightness in your throat and dampness in your palms. It's only 130
yards, but the green appears to be an island with zero room for error.</p>
<p>There is, in fact, more room behind the green than it might appear, so a
few times around the course will improve your score. A huge rock water
feature that is visible from several holes dominates the middle of the
course.</p>
<p>Just south of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/minocqua-wisconsin-lake-vacation/">Minocqua</a>,
<a href="http://www.timberridgegolfclub.com">Timber Ridge Golf Club</a> is the
centerpiece of a self-contained community designed by superstar Roger
Packard and built in 1977.</p>
<p>A service-oriented staff holds sway over leagues, lessons and clinics
that provide a wealth of entertainment value to residents as well as
casual visitors.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The course features five sets of tees, ranging from 4,700 to 6,700
yards, that accommodate junior members as well as big hitters.</p>
<p>There is plenty of personality to the course layout without the
ball-gobbling intrusion of the northern forest. Signature No. 16 is a
165-yard par three that appears to be all railroad ties and sand when
you contemplate your tee shot, but most of the holes are built to be
friendly to the community residents.</p>
<p>A few miles north of <em>Minocqua</em> and across the road from Trout Lake is
<a href="http://www.troutlakegolf.com">Trout Lake Golf Club</a>. The historic
claim to fame for Trout Lake is that it is the oldest 18-hole course in
this area; by 1926, it had a full 18 in play.</p>
<p>Originally a potato farm, the clubhouse is the original residence, with
wrap-around porches and cozy sitting areas to watch the meandering Trout
River out the back door.</p>
<p>The river also is the dominant feature on the course, and native-grass
areas add personality and intrigue to the course.</p>
<p>With bouncy poa-grass tees, greens and fairways, there is a consistent
feel and perfect conditions throughout.</p>
<p>Trout Lake has received four stars from Golf Digest as well as a Best
Places to Play designation, and it has hosted Wisconsin PGA events.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/a/sayner_plum_lake_clubhouse.jpg" alt="Plum Lake clubhouse near Sayner." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In 1912, Plum Lake Golf Club near Sayner became the first golf course in
Wisconsin's north woods.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Even closer to Minocqua is the <a href="https://stgermaingolf.com/"><strong>St. Germain Golf
Club</strong></a>, owned and operated by the town of
<em>St. Germain.</em>  This municipal course is a beautiful blend of
sophisticated in-town golf club with some distant corners to remind you
that you are still in the woods.</p>
<p>The front nine was designed by Gilmore Graves in 1993 and in 1996 was
followed by the back nine, designed by Don Stepanek. The two were
magically integrated into a full 18 that flows effortlessly through
stands of white and Norway pines.</p>
<p>The local version of Amen corner, made up of holes 5, 6 and 7, is tucked
in the farthest reaches of the property. This is where you need to slow
down your game and take a minute to remind yourself that a great day on
the golf course is about more than shots and scores.</p>
<p>The soft hand of the designer on this gorgeous stretch is certainly the
best possible use of this land. Playing to a robust 6,651 yards, the
rest of the course is an interesting blend of double doglegs, double
fairways and double bunkers that dare you to unravel the best way to
play each hole.</p>
<p>A few miles farther east is another municipal, <a href="http://www.eaglerivergolfcourse.com">Eagle River Golf
Course</a>. The entrance to the
course is unceremoniously located behind a shopping area in <em>Eagle
River,</em> and the view from the clubhouse doesn't seem very dramatic.</p>
<p>As it turns out, that view is of the practice area and the first few
holes from the original 1923 design.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Once you reach hole No. 6, you begin a swooping up-and-down,
back-and-forth ride through a beautifully crafted, rolling landscape
that is mostly the 1988 back-nine creation of Don Herfort.</p>
<p>Particularly noticeable are the contoured fairways that are graded to
accept shots regardless of ball flight. Even if one strays, the
bordering woods have been meticulously brushed, allowing a punch-out to
get back in play.</p>
<p>The result is a very well-maintained, player-friendly course that has
received four stars from Golf Digest.</p>
<p>Our tour of the Wisconsin woods will end where it all began, <a href="http://www.plumlakegolf.com/"><strong>Plum
Lake Golf Club</strong></a>, just north of <strong>Sayner</strong>
and about a half hour northeast of
Minocqua. This nine-hole, 3,100-yard classic was built in 1912 on the
shores of Plum Lake.</p>
<p>In spite of its age, the course continues to win awards both for its
historical significance and its quality of play.</p>
<p>In 1912, Woodrow Wilson defeated incumbent William Taft and a gone-rogue
Teddy Roosevelt, and politics certainly were discussed in the wooden
chairs on the wrap-around deck of the clubhouse.</p>
<p>This is a wonderful opportunity to be part of the history of the
Wisconsin north woods.</p>

Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dining:</em>  The <a href="https://rhinelandertaproom.com/">Rhinelander Café and
Pub</a> in downtown Rhinelander
definitely is the town gathering place. Turn right when you walk in and
you can pull up at the breakfast-lunch counter, or turn left and cozy up
to the bar.</p>
<p>Walk farther in and you will be in the massive dining room, where you
can eat three tasty home-style meals a day at bargain prices. If you
can't find a place to park on Brown Street, there is a big lot in the
back with a door to the dining room. 715-362-2424.</p>
<p>You often hear someone say, &quot;no trip is complete without . . . &quot; but in
the case of McGregors <a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/restaurants/mcgregors-blink-bonnie-supper-club-267060">Blink Bonnie Supper
Club</a>
in <strong>St. Germain,</strong> that's all you hear.</p>
<p>Known locally as &quot;The Blink,&quot; this steak house is located almost across
the street from the St. Germain Golf Club, which makes it the perfect
conclusion to an afternoon on the links.</p>
<p>They don't take reservations, so the crowd literally will tail-gate in
the parking lot in the late afternoon, waiting for the doors to open.
The wait can be more than an hour during busy times, but the full bar is
renowned for classic cocktails, so who cares (except the designated
driver).</p>
<p><em>Parking tip:</em>  Street parking appears free and plentiful in downtown
<em>Minocqua,</em> but looks are deceiving. The parking meters are tucked up
by the buildings across the sidewalk from the street, so bring your
change.</p>
