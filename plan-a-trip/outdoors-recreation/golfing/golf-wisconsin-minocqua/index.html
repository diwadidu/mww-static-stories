<h2>dd</h2>
<p>IMG:RIGHT</p>
<p>boulderjct.org/history.php</p>
<p>The woods and waters of north central Wisconsin offer some of the best vacation opportunities in the Midwest. Stretching from Hayward in the west to Minocqua in the east, you will find an abundance of fishing, boating, swimming, hiking, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, Friday fish fries and, if you are so inclined, there is a little bar on virtually every intersection. Sometimes two. The area also has a hundred year history of golf dating back to the opening of the Plum Lake course in Sayner in 1912.</p>
<p>Where Hayward is boisterous and brash, Minocqua is relaxed and comfortable. Hayward has a population of a little over 2000, but is quick to point out that they are the home of the world�s largest Muskie, the Lumberjack World Championships, the American Birkebeiner, and claim the world�s best hamburger, the world�s best 10-hole golf course, and the title of �Wisconsin�s Golf Capital.�</p>
<p>Minocqua has almost twice as many residents, but temper their boasts with a bit of Midwestern humility (although there is Rollie and Helen�s World�s Largest Muskie Shop). Cleverly nicknamed the �Island City,� downtown Minocqua sits squarely in the middle of Lake Minocqua accessed by a couple bridges carrying north-south travelers on Highway 51.</p>
<p>Located 2-1/2 hours from the Twin Cities, Hayward is an easy weekend destination, whereas Minocqua is a 4-5 hour drive from their main tourist markets to the south and east. Perhaps that defines the personalities as Minocqua�s visitors tend to stay longer and are more able to develop some sort of vacation inner peace.</p>
<p>While not holding the �Golf Capital� title, Minocqua can give their western counterpart a run for their money in the style and quality of golf courses in the area stretching from the aforementioned Plum Lake course in the north to the beefy Northwood municipal course in Rhinelander to the south.</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>Rhinelander is more businesslike than Minocqua. With its Wisconsin River location, it has some industry and a bigger city vibe. The city owned Northwood Golf Club (<a href="http://www.northwoodgolfclub.com">www.northwoodgolfclub.com</a>) was designed by Don Herfort and opened for play in 1989.</p>
<p>This is not your normal muni-course. This is a professional, big-time golf course stretching over 6700 yards with a first class bar and restaurant, practice facility and GPS on the golf carts. Golf Digest has awarded the course its second highest ranking at 4-1/2 stars and named it as the third best municipal course in the country in 2003. That makes peak rates of $45 walking a relative steal.</p>
<p>As you line up the tee shot on the par-3 11th hole, you will notice tightness in your throat and dampness in your palms. While only 130 yards, the green appears to be an island with zero room for error. There is, in fact, more room behind the green than it might appear so a few times around the course will improve your score. A huge rock water feature that is visible from several holes dominates the middle of the course.</p>
<p>Like some other muni-courses, it feels like the staff is just there to take your money and have little interest in whether you ever come back, so if a very nice course is good enough for your experience, this will do just fine. If you don�t choose to start your day with �crabby,� there are a lot of other options.</p>
<p>For example, just south of Minocqua Timber Ridge Golf Club (<a href="http://www.timberridgegolfclub.com">www.timberridgegolfclub.com</a>) is the centerpiece of a self-contained community designed by superstar Roger Packard and built in 1977. PGA Professional Tom Dolby and wife Kalynn head up a service oriented staff that holds sway over a potpourri of leagues, lessons and clinics which provide a wealth of entertainment value to the residents as well as casual visitors.</p>
<p>The course features five sets of tees ranging from 4700 to 6700 yards which accommodate their junior members as well as the big hitters. There is plenty of personality to the course layout without the ball-gobbling intrusion of the northern forest. Signature hole #16 is a 165 yard par three that appears to be all railroad ties and sand when you contemplate your tee shot, but most of the holes are built to be friendly to the community residents.</p>
<p>Peak rates are $47 for 18-holes walking in mid-summer and the twilight rates are deeply discounted.</p>
<p>A few miles north of Minocqua and across the road from Trout Lake is Trout Lake Golf Club (<a href="http://www.troutlakegolf.com">www.troutlakegolf.com</a>). The historic claim to fame for Trout Lake is that it is the oldest 18 hole course in this area with a full 18 in play by 1926. Originally a potato farm, the clubhouse is the original residence with wrap around porches and cozy sitting areas to watch the meandering Trout River out the back door.</p>
<p>The river is also the dominant feature on the course. Pro Mike Osborne, whose soft Kansas drawl belies his devotion to his adopted home, and Superintendent Randy Swonger have overseen a million dollar renovation introducing native grass areas that add personality and intrigue to the course. With bouncy Poa grass tees, greens and fairways there is a consistent feel and perfect conditions throughout.</p>
<p>Trout Lake has received four stars from Golf Digest as well as a 2008-2009 �Best Places to Play� designation, and has hosted Wisconsin PGA events. Rates peak at $47 on summer weekends with bargain twilight rates and coupons galore if you look around.</p>
<p>Even closer to Minocqua is the St. Germain Golf Club (<a href="http://www.stgermain">www.stgermain</a>-golfclub.com), owned and operated by the Town of St. Germain. This municipal course is a beautiful blend of sophisticated in-town golf club with some distant corners to remind you that you are still in the woods. The front nine was designed by Gilmore Graves in 1993 and immediately followed by the back nine designed by Don Stepanek in 1996. The two were magically integrated into a full 18 that flows effortlessly through stands of white and Norway pines.</p>
<p>The local version of Amen corner, made up of holes 5, 6 and 7, is tucked in the farthest reaches of the property. This is where you need to slow down your game and take a minute to remind yourself that a great day on the golf course is about more than shots and scores. The soft hand of the designer on this gorgeous stretch is certainly the best possible use of this land. Playing to a robust 6,651 yards, the rest of the course is an interesting blend of double doglegs, double fairways, and double bunkers that dare you to unravel the best way to play each hole.</p>
<p>The operation is run by Pro Brian Baldwin who is beyond a class act. In addition to the business duties of running this Golf Digest 4-1/2 star facility, he scrounges equipment and prizes for his junior program that runs every Tuesday for six weeks in the summer. The program is free and open to all, whether you are there for one session or all six. The whole thing ends with a July tournament for the kids grouped by age, and for 15-bucks includes golf, hot dogs and prizes.</p>
<p>High season rates top out at $46 with twilight rates just over half that. There are also attractive 10-play passes and town resident discounts. Rather than sucking cash from the town�s park and rec budget, the course actually returns money to the town coffers on a regular basis, a rarity among municipal courses.</p>
<p>A few miles farther east is another municipal, Eagle River Golf Course (<a href="http://www.eaglerivergolfcourse.com">www.eaglerivergolfcourse.com</a>). The entrance to the course is unceremoniously located behind a north Eagle River shopping area and the view from the clubhouse doesn�t seem very dramatic.</p>
<p>As it turns out, that view is of the practice area and the first few holes from the original 1923 design. Once you reach hole #6 you begin a swooping up and down, back and forth ride through a beautifully crafted, wooded rolling landscape that is mostly the 1988 back-nine creation of Don Herfort.</p>
<p>ADS:16</p>
<p>Particularly noticeable are the contoured fairways that are graded to accept shots regardless of ball flight. Even if one strays, the bordering woods have been meticulously brushed allowing a punch-out to get back in play. The result is a very well maintained player friendly course that has received 4-stars from Golf Digest for the last ten years.</p>
<p>Pro Brad Missling oversees a strong junior program with a Junior Golf Camp, Saturday clinics and a Junior Golf League. The course has also hosted the Wisconsin PGA Match Play Championship as well a number of regional tournaments.</p>
<p>This is a great value course with rates topping out at $38 for 18 holes and twilight rates of $15 for unlimited play.</p>
<p>When the snow flies the Nordmarka Ski Club takes over using the course for 11K of groomed cross country trails.</p>
<p>Our tour of the Wisconsin woods will end where it all began, Plum Lake Golf Club, just north of Sayner and about a half hour northeast of Minocqua. This 9-hole, 3100 yard classic was built in 1912 on the shores of Plum Lake.</p>
<p>Shawn Savel currently manages this laid back facility. How laid back is it? On a recent visit on a drizzly spring day there was a sign on the clubhouse door that said, �Out running errands, play golf if you want � Shawn.� In spite of its age, the course continues to win awards for both its historical significance and its quality of play.</p>
<p>In 1912 Woodrow Wilson defeated incumbent William Taft and a gone-rogue Teddy Roosevelt, and the politics were certainly discussed in the wooden chairs on the wrap-around deck of the clubhouse. For a $25 green fee this is a wonderful opportunity to be part of the history of the Wisconsin north woods.</p>
<p>Trip Tips:</p>
<p>Dining:</p>
<p>If Smokey�s Restaurant (<a href="http://www.smokeydining.com">www.smokeydining.com</a>) (715 543-2220) was in a big city, one might say it is self-indulgent with a menu beyond the capabilities of the kitchen staff and service laced with misplaced arrogance.</p>
<p>Since it is in Manitowish Waters, northwest of Minocqua, you could just say that it tries hard. The owner has assigned the staff to create the best fine dining site in northern Wisconsin and they do try hard, but like high schoolers in a class play, they may not fully understand the part they have been given. Still, you have to appreciate the effort, the building has a certain casual elegance, and overall, Smokey�s is worth a visit.</p>
<p>The Rhinelander Caf� and Pub (715 362-2424) in downtown Rhinelander is definitely the town gathering place. Turn right when you walk in and you can pull up at the breakfast-lunch counter, or turn left and cozy up to the bar. Walk further in and you will be in the massive dining room where you can eat three tasty home-style meals a day at bargain prices with a sailing vessel motif. If you can�t find a place to park on Brown Street, there is a big lot in the back with a door to the dining room.</p>
<p>You often hear someone say, �no trip is complete without�..� but in the case of McGregors Blink Bonnie Supper Club in St. Germain, that�s all you hear.</p>
<p>Known locally as �The Blink,� this steak house is located almost across the street from the St. Germain Golf Club, which makes it the perfect conclusion to an afternoon on the links. They don�t take reservations so the crowd will literally tail-gate in the parking lot in the late afternoon waiting for the doors to open. The wait can be over an hour during busy times, but their full bar is renowned for classic cocktails so who cares (except the designated driver).</p>
<p>Lodging:</p>
<p>For a longer stay that the Minocqua area deserves consider a housekeeping cabin at a local resort. Alpine Resort (<a href="http://www.alpine">www.alpine</a>-resort.com) near Boulder Junction offers a dozen lodging choices ranging from water�s edge cabins to affordable motel units. Chicago expatriates energetic Tim and entertaining Kim Bowler run the place in true mom and pop style while smarty-pants (in a good way) daughter Cameil can more than hold her own in bonfire conversations with the adults. The Presque-Isle Chain of Lakes are designated as class �A� muskie lakes, and there are a dozen good golf courses within an hour�s drive so there is plenty to do. The resort offers meal plan, maid service and short stay options.</p>
<p>Tip: Street parking appears free and plentiful in downtown Minocqua, but looks are deceiving. The parking meters are tucked up by the buildings across the sidewalk from the street so bring your change.</p>
