<p>One year, I declared war on ice.</p>
<p>You can have the finest skis, snowshoes and 4-wheel drives in the world,
and you're still dead in the water when trails are covered with ice.</p>
<p>So for Christmas, everybody got ice grippers. I gave my husband a set
whose teeth and chains made it look like S&amp;M gear, and my son got a set
with low-profile spikes that wouldn't embarrass him on walks to class.
I gave myself a pair, too.</p>
<p>We didn't have long to wait to try them. One weekend when we were in
Duluth, rain turned into ice that coated streets and trails.</p>
<p>Determined to enjoy the sparkling but dangerous scenery outdoors, we
headed onto the Superior Hiking Trail with four different kinds of ice
grippers.</p>
<p>What worked best? The most expensive pair . . . and the super-cheap
pair.</p>
<p>The day before, Duluth's Hartley Park had been crowded with
cross-country skiers. On the next day it was nearly empty, because skiing on
icy trails is asking for broken bones.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We didn't fall. But within 10 minutes, one of my Due North Everyday Ice
Creepers fell off. The little spikes did grip the
ice, but snow pulled off the rubber that was supposed to grip my boot.</p>
<p>Luckily, I was wearing gaiters that buckled under my instep, so I just
buckled in the grippers. But then the top two spikes nosed up over my
boot toe, leaving only four spikes under my foot.</p>
<p>As I fussed with my feet, my husband was smiling rather smugly. He was
wearing <a href="http://kahtoola.com/product/microspikes/">Kahtoola Microspikes</a>. There was nothing micro about them,
which is why they worked so well.</p>
<p>He was also carrying a pair of
<a href="https://yaktrax.com/">Yaktrax</a>, which uses steel coils
over rubber webbing. In Hartley Park, we passed another hiker who wore
Yaktrax and said she goes through four pairs every winter.</p>
<p>At $20 apiece, that's more than one pair of Kahtoola Microspikes —
which probably is why she showed so much interest in my husband's feet. We've also seen Yaktrax lying along trails, which means they fall off easily.</p>
<p>Many people consider <a href="https://icebug.com/">Icebug boots</a> the gold standard of ice traction, because spikes are embedded right in the boot, so they'll never fall off.</p>
<p>Eventually, I abandoned the Due North Ice Creepers and put on the $4
crampons I bought years before at Ehler's General Store near the mainland ice caves in the
Apostles.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/microspikes.jpg" alt="A set of ice grippers that really works." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Kahtoola Microspikes aren't cheap, but they work well and don't fall
off.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>They're just a claw on a strap that I buckle around my instep, but they
work, and they easily fit into my pocket.</p>
<p>Metal snowshoes with claws work on mildly icy snow, but not on pure ice.
Ski poles are handy, though. They won't grip, but they'll help you
keep your balance, and they're especially useful on hills.</p>
<p>When choosing ice grippers, read online reviews and think about how
you'll be using them. In snow, you need something that fits around most
of your foot, or the snow will pull it off.</p>
<p>The Due North Ice Creepers might be fine on ice-glazed sidewalks, and
they fold up to fit in a pocket.</p>
<p>But a better choice might be <a href="https://stabilwork.com/traction.html">Stabil's</a> Lite Walker, which
grips farther up the boot, or the Lite Hiker, which attaches
with a strap.</p>
<p>The Stabilicers Maxx attach even more securely. But at $49.95, I'd
spend a few more bucks to get the Kahtoola spikes.</p>
<p>So what if they look like an S&amp;M toy. When you're out enjoying the scenery
while everyone else is stuck at home, no one will laugh.</p>

<h3>Where to walk on ice</h3>
<p>It's a mile over Lake Superior to the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/ice-caves-apostles/">mainland ice caves of the
Apostles</a> on Wisconsin's Bayfield Peninsula,
and then you'll want to walk into the caves, which are sheer ice.</p>
<p>When the lake isn't frozen, hike the clifftop Lakeshore Trail to the
caves.</p>
<p>Take ice grippers whenever you go
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/">snowshoeing</a>; often, a crust of ice covers
trails, and it's safer to wear grippers than snowshoes.</p>
<p>One of the best snowshoe trails is in the western tip of the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan, where there are five waterfalls along the last
two miles of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/black-river-michigan/">Black
River</a> before it
reaches Lake Superior.</p>
<p>I've gone snowshoeing there twice and ended up walking both times.</p>
<p>In northwest Wisconsin, the frozen rapids of <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/amnicon/">Amnicon Falls State
Park</a> are fun to explore.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/snowshoeing-north-shore/">Minnesota's North Shore</a> of Lake
Superior is lined with good spots. Hikers can try any stretch of the
Superior Hiking Trail.</p>
<p>For sightseeing and exploring, go to Artists' Point in Grand Marais and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/gooseberry-falls/">Gooseberry Falls State Park</a> near Two Harbors.</p>
<p>And when winds kick up and push waves against the point at Tettegouche
State Park, they create a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150162879570129.339344.104777055128&amp;type=3">magical ice
garden</a>.</p>
