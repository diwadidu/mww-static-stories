<p>Along the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore in Wisconsin, everyone
waits for a big freeze.</p>
<p>Only when temperatures stay low for a long time will the edges of Lake
Superior freeze enough for people to walk out to the mainland ice caves,
whose beauty is renowned.</p>
<p>Even when ice is sufficiently solid, wind may suddenly split it, and
snow may block the access drive. So when park rangers say it's okay to
go — well, then you'd better go.</p>
<p>In recent years, warm weather and/or winds have kept cave access closed. In 2015, it
opened Feb. 28, and in 2014 it opened unusually early, on Jan. 15.</p>
<p>It's usually late February when callers to the ice-cave hot line hear
those magic words: &quot;Conditions <em>do</em> allow access to the mainland sea
caves.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The first year I saw them, it was the first day of March when I drove
four miles from Cornucopia to Meyers Road, parked near the lakeshore and
started picking my way over the lumpy path across the frozen lake.</p>
<p>The whole world was white, except for the frosty blue of the sky, and it
was hard to tell where lake ended and shore began — especially since a
4-foot-high wall of snowy boulders sat where I thought the lake should be.</p>
<p>Then I passed Craig Mealman of nearby Russell Township, who explained
that the &quot;boulders&quot; were blocks of ice pushed toward the shore by wind.</p>
<p>Mealman had just been to the caves and was planning to return the next
week with a picnic.</p>
<p>&quot;There are a few areas where I'd just like to sit and look at it,&quot; he
said. &quot;You can sit and take in the awe of it. In one place, it looks
just like a crystal geode on the inside; it's cool.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/c/icecave.jpg" alt="Walking by the ice caves." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A cave frames the wide-open spaces of Lake Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The ice is formed by lake spray and by water trickling over and between
layers of the red sandstone cliffs, which rise 50 to 80 feet above the
lake. Ice formations also can be found in the sea caves at Swallow Point
on Sand Island and on the north shore of Devil's Island.</p>
<p>But it's rare to gain access to those caves, unlike the ones that line
the bay called Mawikwe, Ojibwe for weeping woman.</p>
<p>Delicately colored by minerals in the rock and soil, frozen to the
cliffs in ways that mimic the stalactites, columns and flowstone found
in underground caves, the ice formations are spectacular — and
irresistible to photographers.</p>
<p>As the sun began to settle toward the horizon, I reached the caves and
found that all three others there were professional photographers,
busily adding ice-cave shots to their stock.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I walked closer to the caves and skidded; snowshoes aren't much good on
glass. An infinite variety of ice covered the cliffs — smooth blue
humps at the base, froths of mint-green blooming out of the middle and
thin layers draped over the top, translucent as a centenarian's skin.</p>
<p>It was as if a limestone cave had been turned inside out and left to
shimmer in the sun. There were colonies of chalk-white soda straws and
bacon-strip flowstone.</p>
<p>Inside the caves, gnarled yellow columns formed rows of organ pipes, and
stalactites hung like cow teats.</p>
<p>Outside, ice clung to rock in ridged waves, like fish scales, and the
soda straws in some crevices were as thick as shag carpet.</p>
<p>All this ice is just a bonus, though, for the cliffs are spectacular in
themselves. Over eons, the waves of Lake Superior have cut arches and
chambers in this red sandstone, with shadowy interiors connected by
skeletal fingers of rock.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Topped by spindly birch trees, white and black against the winter sky,
they're breathtaking.</p>
<p>Soon the light began to fade, and I ducked into a cave one last time,
looking through a fringe of icicles at the red sun sitting on the
horizon, amid bands of pink.</p>
<p>The photographers went on to other landscapes, and I went into
Cornucopia to have dinner at Fish Lipps, a cheerful place with colored
lights and booths lined by windows.</p>
<p>As I waited for my mushroom-Swiss burger, I talked with local T.J. Lovick. He told me why the park rangers are so
conservative about allowing cave access.</p>
<p>&quot;That lake can split just like that,&quot; he said. &quot;You get wind surges,
and it moves the ice back and forth. One day the lake is white, and the
next day it's open as far as you can see. It can happen in two hours.&quot;</p>
<p>Often, he said, people stop by the restaurant asking for directions to
the caves.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/p/apostles_caves_sunset.jpg" alt="Photographers leave the ice caves at dusk." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Two of the many photographers who flock to the ice caves head home at
dusk.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;We have a lot of people come in and ask for directions in December and
January,&quot; he said. &quot;Their local lakes are frozen, and they think this
is a regular lake.&quot; He laughed uproariously.</p>
<p>Cornucopia, a fishing village since the 1920s, is the northernmost town
in Wisconsin. Today, it's a friendly, laid-back spot with a marina that
caters to sailors and a few gift shops that snag tourists who happen by.</p>
<p>Many kayakers visit the sea caves in summer, but if you don't have your
own kayak, you'll need to rent one, and to do that, you'll need to
show you've completed a safety course.</p>
<p>In winter, all it takes to get to the caves is a pair of legs.</p>
<p>As I headed home, park rangers at the Bayfield headquarters were bracing
for an onslaught of visitors. It was the first weekend people would be
able to get to the caves, and the first winter in years that the ice had frozen for more than a few days.</p>
<p>&quot;The lake is a huge heat sink, and it takes a long time for that heat to
dissipate,&quot; said Neil Howk, the ranger whose voice I had heard so often
on the hot line. &quot;It takes a long time for the ice to get going.&quot;</p>
<p>Rangers regularly check the ice with augers, he said, but still get
nervous, especially with thousands of people going out on a weekend.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;We don't say it's safe to go out on the ice any time, because that's
stupid,&quot; Howk said. &quot;Ice is not safe. Basically, our message is,
conditions do allow access.&quot;</p>
<p>But on the Apostle Islands lakeshore, those are magic words.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Cornucopia and <a href="http://www.nps.gov/apis/mainland-caves-winter.htm">Mawikwe Bay ice caves</a></h3>
<p><em>Information:</em>  For current conditions, call the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/apis/mainland-caves-winter.htm">Apostle Islands
National Lakeshore</a>
ice-caves hot line, 715-779-3397, Ext. 3. Or check the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/apostleislandsnationallakeshore">Facebook
page</a>.</p>
<p>The park service charges a $5-per-person fee to visit the caves, or
a $10 annual pass. Bring cash. There's no charge for children up to
age 15.</p>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> It's a good hour east of Duluth. From there, take
U.S. 2/53 to Wisconsin 13 and Cornucopia, whose &quot;downtown&quot; is just off
Wisconsin 13 on Superior Avenue.</p>
<p>It's another four miles to the parking lot off Meyers Road. From there, it's a
mile walk east to the ice caves.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/c/icecaves_gray.jpg" alt="Ice stalactites in the Apostles." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Stubby stalactites hang from the roof of a cave.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>What to take:</em> Wear crampons on your boots and carry ski or hiking
poles, because the lake surface is sheer ice.</p>
<p>Wear warm clothes, including something to cover the face. It's windy on
the open lake.</p>
<p><em>When to go:</em> Snow insulates the ice and delays a hard freeze; the best
scenario is extreme cold, no snow and no wind. Usually, it's fruitless
to check before mid-February.</p>
<p>The year 2014, however, was very unusual. Rangers gave the okay on Jan.
15, the earliest date in most people's memories. And in 2009, park
rangers gave the okay on Jan. 29 and conditions allowed visits all the
way through mid-March.</p>
<p>The caves are most beautiful in <em>late afternoon,</em>  when the setting sun
illuminates the ice and stone, and during extreme cold, when ice is most
delicately formed. Try to go on weekdays to avoid crowds.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/a/p/apostles_ice_caves_trail2.jpg" alt="Ice caves from Lakeshore Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Even if Lake Superior doesn't freeze, the views of the ice caves are
spectacular from the Lakeshore Trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Obviously, don't go at all unless rangers give the green light. If snow
has been heavy, call and ask if Meyers Road is plowed.</p>
<p>If you want to see the ice caves but can't get to them on the lake, you
can walk to them on the two-mile <em>Lakeshore Trail,</em>  which starts at
Meyers Beach and follows the clifftop (be careful).</p>
<p>You won't get to go into the caves, but you'll see lovely blue and
ocher icefalls over the red cliffs. The patterns of lake ice also are
beautiful when viewed from above.</p>
<p><em>What to take:</em>  Wear sturdy boots and, unless the lake path is packed,
snowshoes. Boot crampons are handy for climbing around inside the
caves.</p>
<p>To be especially safe, keep a buddy nearby and carry ski poles in case
the ice breaks and to help keep your balance on the ice.</p>
<p><em>Dining:</em> The <a href="http://thefatradish.weebly.com/">Fat Radish</a> serves
soups, salads and sandwiches in the former Village Inn.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations:</em>  The <a href="http://www.siskiwitbay.com/">Fo'c'sle B&amp;B</a> has
two attractive rooms with private entrance, overlooking Siskiwit Bay
Marina; breakfast is brought to the door. Dave and Mary Beth Tillmans
are the owners.</p>
<p>Also on the bay, <a href="https://siskiwitbaylodge.com/">Siskiwit Bay Lodge</a>
offers a suite and three rooms.</p>
<p>There are many more <a href="https://www.bayfield.org/lodging/">places to stay</a>
in and around Bayfield.</p>
