<p>In this chilly region, smart men are on to Victoria's Secret.</p>
<p>Shopping at the mall, they breeze right by the silk nighties, the gold
bracelets, the dainty perfumes. Because what Victoria secretly wants for
Christmas are merino-wool undies, a goose-down parka and moosehide
mukluks.</p>
<p>When I was a newcomer to Minnesota, my boyfriend was a smart man. Our
first Christmas, he gave me a bulky down parka that made me look like
the Michelin man.</p>
<p>The second Christmas, he gave me a big sheepskin hat that made me look
like a Cossack. The third Christmas, he gave me chunky mukluks that made
me look like an Inuit.</p>
<p>Forget dainty. I was warm. The dorkier it was, the better I liked it —
think Marge in &quot;Fargo.&quot;</p>
<p>There were more gifts — a long cashmere scarf, down booties,
battery-heated socks, wool legwarmers and a pre-PC pair of elephant-skin
gloves lined with rabbit fur. Apparently, he thought the way to a
woman's heart was through her skin. It worked on me.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s, a winter in the Upper Midwest was a real blast —
and not in a good way. Winters today are far milder, but they have their
moments. So over the years, I have assembled an impressive arsenal of
warm clothes.</p>
<p>On my way to the International Continental Cup ski-jumping tournament in
Westby, Wis., one February, I stopped by the Company Store outlet in La
Crosse, Wis., and bought a pair of down-filled ski pants.</p>
<p>In southeast Minnesota, I bought a pair of fuzzy mohair socks from a
woman who runs a goat farm.</p>
<p>I bought a pair of fleece-lined mittens one August in Baudette, Minn.,
on the Canadian border, figuring that anything that came from there had
to be warm.</p>
<p>And whenever I visit the <a href="https://hodancs.org/bargain-nook-stores/">Bargain
Nooks</a> of southwest Wisconsin,
which carry cut-rate Lands' End catalog returns, I stock up on long
underwear, felt slippers, down coats and insulated boots.</p>
<p>If it looked warm and it fit, I bought it, regardless of season. I was
always glad later, when I was climbing up to the North Shore's Carlton
Peak in a 70-below wind chill or waiting into the subzero wee hours for
Beargrease mushers to arrive on the Gunflint Trail.</p>
<p>My most prized item is my pair of Steger mukluks; cold feet are the
Achilles' heel of anyone who spends time outdoors. Underneath, I wear
merino wool socks or my mohair socks from Austin's near Harmony, Minn.</p>
<p>My down ski bibs are too warm for anything but Siberian temperatures, so
instead I wear fleece-lined, windproof L.L. Bean pants with my Lands'
End down parka or my beloved Thinsulate snowsuit, which I bought from
Eddie Bauer in the '80s but haven't seen for sale since.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Under that, I wear a silk or poly turtleneck under merino wool long
underwear and, if needed, fleece or a densely woven wool sweater.</p>
<p>I wear fleece on my head and neck, supplemented by a balaclava or the
hood of my parka, though I'm thinking of buying a fur-lined Columbia
Siwwy rabbit bomber cap that would make my Marge-morphosis complete.</p>
<p>And on my hands, I wear thick men's Kombi gloves, big enough so I can
ball my fingers into fists if they get cold.</p>
<p>I've finally learned how to be warm. Now, I can laugh at winter. Well,
not really. But occasionally, I manage a few weak smiles.</p>
<h3>Trip (and gift) tips: Staying warm in winter</h3>
<p>Warm clothing may not be the most glamorous gift in the world, but it
could be the most appreciated.</p>
<p>Good outdoors attire gives its wearer the freedom to enjoy winter
without worrying about the cold — to explore ice caves, walk up frozen
rivers, watch sled-dog races or follow animal tracks into the forest.</p>
<p>Considering that it's winter for four or five months out of every year,
that's quite a gift.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Over the years, space-age technology has made warm clothes even warmer
— and more expensive. That's another reason why it's a good gift —
most people can't afford to buy everything they want for themselves.</p>
<p>&quot;But it all lasts a long time, so it's an investment,&quot; says Lin
Meyers, longtime clothing buyer for Midwest Mountaineering in
Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Here are the basics on winter warmth:</p>
<h3>Dress in layers</h3>
<p>Next to the skin, put something that wicks away sweat. On top of that,
put something warm and insulating. On the outside, wear something that
repels wind. The aim is to trap the body's heat and get rid of its
moisture.</p>
<p>For the wicking and wind-repelling layers, the many new designer
polyesters do a good job, and goose down is the best insulator. But
there's still a lot to consider beyond that when buying warm clothes.</p>
<p>Here's a guide, with help from Meyers, a winter camper.</p>
<h3>Long underwear/first layer</h3>
<p>&quot;What's gone back into vogue is wool,&quot; Meyers says. &quot;If I'm out
in 30 below, I want wool next to my skin. Merino wool is soft, not
itchy, and you can throw it into the wash.&quot;</p>
<p>Merino wool is warm, wicks well and doesn't get stinky, but it's
expensive, and some people do find it a little itchy. In that case, buy
a set in a cushy synthetic material, and if it's for a man who sweats a
lot, buy one with a compound that retards bacterial growth.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_cold.jpg" alt="Three skiers on the Gunflint Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Scott Stammer</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Three friends from the Twin Cities came up to the Gunflint Trail in
January, skied in 30-below temperatures . . . and lived to smile about
it.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Silk sets feel nice but aren't very warm and don't wick as well or dry
as fast as wool or poly. However, they double as pajamas on summer
camping trips.</p>
<p>Never wear cotton, which absorbs moisture and keeps it next to the
skin.</p>
<h3>Down coats</h3>
<p>The best coats have a breathable and wind-resistant shell, baffled
construction to prevent cold from seeping through seams and high-quality
loft, often described as &quot;fill power.&quot;</p>
<p>A lot of down is good, but if a coat is good at maintaining loft —
insulating by trapping air — it doesn't need as much down and can be
lighter.</p>
<p>Make sure the fill is all or almost all goose down, not feathers. Meyers
recommends giving a coat a good pinch: &quot;If it's quality, you can tell
there aren't quills in it,&quot; she says.</p>
<h3>Vests</h3>
<p>When the torso is toasty, it can send heat down to the hands and feet.
Athletes don't need one, but they're handy for people who want to
watch races and parades.</p>
<p>For stand-alone wear, down is best; if it will be worn under a jacket,
try Primaloft or another synthetic fill that compresses well.</p>
<h3>Mittens and gloves</h3>
<p>If you can only buy one thing, and you can't afford mukluks, make it
something great for the hands. Mittens are warmest, but gloves allow
their wearer to grasp a ski pole or walking stick.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Look for a waterproof and windproof shell, a leather palm, down or
Primaloft fill, a synthetic liner that can be removed for drying and a
long sleeve or cuff: &quot;You lose a lot of heat from the wrist,&quot; Meyers
says.</p>
<h3>Hats</h3>
<p>It's good to own a variety of layers. For someone who will be exerting
himself, buy an inexpensive, stretchy polyester headband (makes a good
stocking stuffer) to wear under a plain fleece hat that can come off
when the body starts to sweat and needs to dissipate heat.</p>
<p>For someone more likely to be standing around, get a wind-resistant
fleece hat and a thin balaclava (also a good stocking stuffer) or a
wind-proof bomber hat that has pile-lined flaps to pull over the ears.</p>
<p>&quot;You can go a little more toward the dork factor here because people
want to stay warm,&quot; Meyers says.</p>
<h3>Socks</h3>
<p>Once you try merino-wool socks, which have longer fibers that have been
treated to reduce itchiness, you'll never go back to cotton. Make sure
they have reinforced heels and toes so they'll last longer.</p>
<p>SmartWool socks are warm and even stylish, but they don't last very
long and are expensive, so if you want them, stock up
at sales. Costco's merino-wool socks aren't stylish but cost less than a third as much.</p>
<p>Keen socks are similarly expensive but sturdier; Woolrich socks are much
cheaper and also good.</p>
<p>Costco has by far the best deal for women: 82 percent merino-wool socks,
four for $12.</p>

Unless you generate a whole lot of body heat, don't go hatless when
temperatures dip below zero.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Nearly everyone can wear merino-wool socks, but people with
extra-sensitive skin can wear inexpensive silk or poly sock liners under
wool or mohair socks.</p>
<p>Fleece socks aren't as warm as wool and don't conform to the foot as
well, but they dry faster and aren't itchy.</p>
<p>And if you'll be outside for a long time, slip a toe warmer into your
boot. You can get them for about $1 apiece at big-box stores.</p>
<h3>Boots</h3>
<p>Moosehide mukluks are the gold standard. They're half as heavy as
pac-style boots but also twice as expensive.</p>
<p>Pac boots, however, are much better to wear around water or in slush,
since the foot generally is waterproof.</p>
<p>Both styles should have felted wool liners for warmth, and both must be
roomy enough for the foot to move around inside a warm sock.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's too tight, it restricts blood flow and the foot will be
cold,&quot; Meyers said.</p>
<p>No northerner ever can have enough cold-weather gear. But even a few key
pieces will let people stop worrying and love the cold.</p>
<p>&quot;You can have so much more fun if you're warm and comfortable,&quot;
Meyers said. &quot;Then, winter's actually fun.&quot;</p>
<h3>Where to look</h3>
<p>Outdoors stores and ski shops sell warm outerwear, including Midwest
Mountaineering in Minneapolis, REI, EMS, Dick's, Gander Mountain,
Sportmart and Cabela's. Watch for sales.</p>
<p>Many online companies sell a good selection of clothes and often put
items on sale. Many offer free shipping, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.campmor.com">Campmor</a> offers discount prices on its own
brand of cold-weather clothing as well as such brands as Columbia, North
Face, Gordini, Seirus, Sorel, Marmot, Duofold and SmartWool, and it has
