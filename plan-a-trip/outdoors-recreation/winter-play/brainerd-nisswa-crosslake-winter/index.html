<h2>When this Minnesota resort area slows down, it's time to take to the forest.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/e/pequot_hoarfrost.jpg" alt="Hoarfrost in Pequot Lakes." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In winter, the famous Brainerd Lakes freeze over, ice houses replace
pontoon boats and skiers and snowmobilers ply the forests.</p>
<p>There's a lot to do. But in winter, many tourists forget about
Brainerd.</p>
<p>That makes it a good time to find a deal. We got one and didn't feel
too deprived by the lack of snow.</p>
<p>We hiked under bright-blue skies in a frosted forest, crossing bogs and
watching for wildlife. And because we had time, we finally discovered
something we'd bypassed dozens of times.</p>
<p>The first time we got a winter deal in the Brainerd area, it was at
Cragun's. Our kids were little, so we signed up for one of the big
resort's family weekends, which included sleigh rides, bonfires and
poolside games.</p>
<p>The area has become even more kid-friendly since then, with small indoor
water-parks opening at three new hotels, and tubing at Ski Gull.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Now that we're empty-nesters, we wanted to be out in the forest, snow
or no snow.</p>
<p>First, we checked in at Good Ol' Days, a handsome resort on Lower
Cullen Lake and the Paul Bunyan State Trail. From there, it's less than
a mile to downtown Nisswa, where we had pizza and beer at friendly
Rafferty's.</p>
<p>In the morning, it looked as if snow had fallen-into the trees,
anyway. Like pixie dust, hoarfrost turns everything it touches into
fairy land, and we marveled at the glittering landscape as we drove to
Pequot Lakes.</p>
<p>Heading east from its trailside depot, we stopped at the first marked
site on the Paul Bunyan Scenic Byway, a steel fire tower atop a hill.</p>
<p>On a colorful kiosk, Paul tells how the tower came to be: Frustrated by
winter's short days, the hard-working lumberjack got Ole the blacksmith
to make a giant torch. Then Paul and Babe the Blue Ox went to Wisconsin,
where giant bees helped them roll up a giant ball of wax.</p>
<p>They put the wax atop the torch and voila! A giant candle that lighted
the forest, allowing Paul to work into the evening.</p>

<p>It was a corker of a tale. &quot;Who comes up with this stuff?&quot; my
appreciative husband wondered.</p>
<p>Crosslake was holding WinterFest, and we passed the ice-car races as we
drove to Uppgaard Wildlife Management Area, where we were surprised to
see skiers braving the lumpy trails.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not bad at all; we just went to the quiet place and back,&quot;
said Paula Schaub of nearby Ideal Corners, out with her grandson. She
also gave us a rundown of other good ski trails.</p>
<p>&quot;Cut Lake near Pine River is the good one, and Breezy Point-it's
kind of the prairie there on the golf course, but it's pretty.&quot;</p>
<p>The Quiet Place turned out to be a real place, a circle of benches
overlooking a pond bisected by two sets of meandering animal tracks. The
110-acre preserve has two ponds, both edged by boardwalk.</p>
<p>One was called the Tadpole Walkway, and we could see the little mites
squirting through the dark water. On the other, we spotted a bald eagle
circling overhead, though it soon was blasted away by the helicopter
offering rides during WinterFest.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We walked another boardwalk on the Veterans Trail, farther down County
Road 16 near Upper Hay Lake. Interpretive markers on the Island Loop
explained that we were walking through shrub swamp, evolving from
wetland into forest.</p>
<p>A snowman sat on a bench at the edge of golden meadow, and a tiny one
sat in the middle of the boardwalk, like a cairn.</p>
<p>Both their heads fell off as we passed, but we squashed them back on and
climbed up the hill on Whiskey Island for a spectacular view of Hay
Creek winding through the swamp.</p>
<p>The Veterans Trail is just 2½ miles from 371, and from there we drove
back to Nisswa, where we checked out the sales at Martin's Ski Shop.
There were people in the tiny downtown, but nothing like summer, when
resorters flood in for mini-doughnuts, cappuccino and a shopping fix.</p>
<p>Next to the old train depot, the icons painted on Smiley the Nisswa Ox
tells what Nisswa is all about: ice cream, turtle races, pizza, fishing,
souvenir shops and lakes.</p>
<p>The town was born in 1900 as Smiley Township; Nisswa comes from the
Ojibwe word <em>nessawae</em>, meaning &quot;in the
middle of three&quot;-three lakes now called Cullen, Clark and Nisswa.</p>

<p>The bakery was closed for the day, but we returned in the morning to
snag an apple fritter. Then we drove back down 371 to Northland
Arboretum, the only place in the area with reliably groomed ski trails.</p>
<p>It's also the southern trailhead of the Paul Bunyan State Trail, and on
the way, we saw a beautiful new bike bridge that crosses Minnesota 210
and eventually will take bicyclists nine miles farther south to Crow
Wing State Park on the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>We'd hiked at the arboretum but never at the state park, so we decided
to keep going. It was a revelation-instead of the ordinary trails
we'd expected, we found the remnants of a ghost town.</p>
<p>In the 1860s, Old Crow Wing was the home of nearly 700 people plus
hotels, saloons and three churches. Before that, it was the home of
Ojibwe leaders, including Hole-in-the-Day, then a crossroads for fur
traders and ox-cart drivers on the Red River Trail.</p>
<p>The last remaining house belonged to prosperous French-Ojibwe trader
Clement Beaulieu, who moved-that is, <em>was</em> moved-
to the White Earth reservation
in 1868, at age 62. Looking in the windows of the still-stately 1849
house, we could see tree-branch rebar in walls of mud mortar.</p>
<p>A boardwalk lined with interpretive plaques lines the riverfront town
site. From there, we hiked on one of the last unaltered stretches of the
Red River Trail between Winnipeg and St. Paul.</p>

Old Crow Wing now is a ghost town.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Seven noisy trumpeter swans flew overhead, followed by another four.
Hidden under slabs of bark, I spotted a camouflaged metal box, one of
the official state park geocaches, filled with beaver cards and frog
tattoos for kids.</p>
<p>We passed the former Episcopal mission, on a suitably high part of the
river banks, then wound around an oxbow of the wide river. In our
mind's eye, we could see ourselves paddling down it in a canoe.</p>
<p>Even in the depths of winter, this was one of the most beautiful state
parks we'd seen, with trails that hug the Mississippi closer than any
others we could think of.</p>
<p>Its ghosts also seem closer. Next time, we won't zip by without a
visit.</p>
