<h2>With their multiple lanes, conveyor lifts and snow-making, these aren't your grandma's hills.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/elm_creek_tubing_jason.jpg" alt="Tubing at Elm Creek Park Reserve." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Jason Sprayberry</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In the Twin Cities, Elm Creek has 13 lanes.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On a 13-lane tubing superhighway, it's easy to feel 8 years old again.</p>
<p>When my daughter begged me to take her tubing at Elm Creek Park Reserve
near Minneapolis, I wondered if I was too old to rocket down an icy
hill.</p>
<p>But a professionally run tubing hill is nothing like a neighborhood
sledding hill. Each lane is groomed, graded and separated by snow berms,
so you don't have to worry about careening into a tree or someone's
knees.</p>
<p>There's no need to trudge back to the top, because a moving sidewalk
takes you there. And when there's not enough snow, the hills just make
some.</p>
<p>In the western suburb of Maple Grove, Elm Creek's Winter Recreation
Area is a megaplex of snow. A mild winter day had brought out crowds to
snowboard, ski and tube.</p>
<p>After my 8-year-old daughter and I paid for two hours of tubing, we
picked out red and blue tubes and waited for a lane.</p>
<p>Who was scared? Not my daughter. &quot;It's not really scary at all,&quot; she
told me reassuringly.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In a few seconds, we were barreling down our lane like greased
lightning. I screamed, closed my eyes and felt 8 again, telling myself I
would be just fine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my daughter was laughing. She leaped up at the end, crying,
&quot;Wasn't that fun?&quot;</p>
<p>The 10-story Magic Carpet took us back to the top. I started feeling
braver, and pretty soon we were tying our tubes together and going down
backward, bouncing off the rails. Some people made convoys of eight
tubes, until an announcer asked them to stick to four or fewer.</p>
<p>Before each run, we stood in line for about five minutes, until we
decided to wait for what one attendant called the &quot;Terrible Lane&quot; —
longer and faster, with a sharp bend at the end. That's when my
daughter ditched me and blazed ahead on her own.</p>
<p>After I finally caught her at the bottom, we headed for the chalet
cafeteria, which sells everything from burgers to espresso drinks.</p>
<p>The great thing about tubing is that anyone can do it. There's no
learning curve, it's not expensive and the only gear required is warm
clothing.</p>
<p>And while you're maxing out your adrenaline, gravity does all the work.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Snow tubing hills</h3>
<p><em>Costs:</em> They vary from $10 for two hours (Winter Park in Kewaunee,
Wis.) to $49 (Wilmot Mountain near Lake Geneva). Most charge $17-$25;
rates are higher at destination ski resorts. Many offer weekday
specials.</p>
<p><em>What to know:</em> Many hills have a height minimum of 42 inches for
children or an age minimum of 4 years. Everyone has to sign a waiver
before tubing.</p>
<p>Most hills have either a handle tow, where people ride their tubes up
the hill, or a &quot;magic carpet&quot;/&quot;moving sidewalk&quot; conveyor lift
— some of them even covered.</p>
<p>Before you go, check for hours (many hills are open weekends only),
special deals, conditions and to make sure the hill isn't closed for a
private party.</p>
<p>All of the hills below have lighted runs, snow-making capability and
heated chalets with snacks.</p>
