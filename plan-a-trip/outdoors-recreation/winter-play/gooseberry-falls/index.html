<h2>In winter, the beloved waterfalls on Minnesota's North Shore turn into a big, frozen playground.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/o/gooseberry_candlelight.jpg" alt="The candlelight ski at Gooseberry Falls State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Paul Sundberg</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>There's one spot along the North Shore at which everyone has to stop.</p>
<p>Its five falls tumble over lumpy floes of ancient lava, filling the air
with mist and tumult.</p>
<p>Intriguing crannies, created by jagged walls of rock and twisted cedars,
turn adults into compulsive shutterbugs and bring out the Indiana Jones
in children, who clamber from one precipice to another.</p>
<p>This is Gooseberry Falls State Park, the most-visited state park in
Minnesota outside of Fort Snelling.</p>
<p>Before the tourists came, its quiet river estuary was often visited by
explorers, one of whom, Sieur des Groseilliers, had a surname that means
&quot;gooseberries&quot; in French.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the winter, the falls seethe rather than roar, but they are even more
beautiful. At the bottom of a 60-foot curtain of icicles, the water
flickers behind filmy veils of ice, then disappears down a second tier
of falls, where only a subdued gurgle reveals its presence.</p>
<p>In the winter, visitors can walk right up, close enough to see swirls,
bubbles and milky bands festooning the ice, as if put there by a
glassblower. Icicles twist down in tangled braids; at Lower Falls, they
form a tunnel big enough for a child to crawl through.</p>
<p>The effect is dramatic and magical and, in fact, reminded my son of the
perpetual winter of the children's classic &quot;The Lion, the Witch and
the Wardrobe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Look, there are two hills,&quot; my son Peter said. &quot;Remember, the
Witch says, 'I live between two hills.' I think we've gone through
the wardrobe.&quot;</p>
<p>Exploring the falls, of course, was the first thing my family did after
settling into the Gooseberry Trailside Suites, which sit on the park's
eastern border.</p>

Sometimes, the ice takes on a blue hue.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The very sight of all that ice galvanized Peter-&quot;I'm Adventure
Boy!&quot; he shouted, racing from one niche to another. By noon, we'd
been joined by a whole crew of other little explorers and their parents.</p>
<p>After lunch, we returned to the park, which had become even busier,
mainly with skiers. We joined a Learn to Snowshoe program, given by
naturalist Retta James-Gasser, who had lined up six different kinds of
snowshoes.</p>
<p>&quot;In Minnesota, it really pays to learn the different styles,&quot; she
said. &quot;On the prairies, you've got the open spaces and wind-packed
snow, but in the BWCA and forests, you've got the fluffy, powdery
snow.&quot;</p>
<p>She held up a high-tech snowshoe with solid synthetic decking, on which
snow can build up. &quot;This isn't made for Minnesota, but that's what's
selling. It's a step backward for Minnesota.&quot;</p>
<p>She gave the children wooden Ojibwe snowshoes, with pointed, upturned
toes and tails, and the adults got Maine snowshoes, with rounded toes.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>As we walked through a cedar grove, she showed us where to &quot;see&quot;
wildlife in the winter: inside goldenrod ball galls, where snippet wasps
sleep; at the end of U-shaped vole tracks, under a comfy blanket of
snow; in a hole pecked into a cedar tree.</p>
<p>At the handsome visitors center, a skier asked James-Gasser about the
big wolf tracks that followed the ski trail, he said, &quot;for a really
long way.&quot; The naturalist wasn't surprised.</p>
<p>&quot;They like a nice, compacted trail, because it's easier to run on,&quot;
she said. &quot;They're not dumb animals.&quot;</p>
<p>Back at the Trailside Suites, I let the children watch a movie while I
skied right from our door onto the state park's 20-kilometer network of
trails.</p>
<p>Following the eastern and northern perimeter of the park, through birch
forest gleaming in the afternoon sun, I saw only one other skier until I
approached the Upper Falls of the Gooseberry River.</p>

Icefalls create nooks and crannies that kids love.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then, after making dinner, we all piled into the car and headed for Two
Harbors, 14 miles south. It doesn't have a lot of nightlife, but it
does have a great 3-kilometer lighted loop on the Two Harbors Municipal
Trail, built and maintained by the local ski club.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful time gliding through the darkness, under a blue-black
sky filled with constellations.</p>
<p>As soon as we got to the cabin, I turned on the sauna. When I got in 45
minutes later, the temperature was edging past 180, and it didn't take
long to feel as cooked as leftover pasta.</p>
<p>Before we left the next day, we hiked up the Split Rock River, just
three miles up the road, where we found a 20-foot waterfall hidden in
the forest. This one, however, had frozen not into icicles but into a
smooth wall that bulged like carved yellow jade.</p>
<p>There was beauty everywhere-in the thicket of birch, their bark a
startling white against the blue sky, and in the expanse of Lake
Superior, so placid that day that two fishermen had taken a boat into
the mouth of the river.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In spring, this forest turns from white to brown to pale chartreuse, and
Gooseberry Falls swells with meltwater. In summer, the crowds arrive.
But the park is at its loveliest in winter.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Minnesota's Gooseberry Falls in winter</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/gooseberry_falls/index.html">Gooseberry Falls State
Park</a>
is 40 miles northeast of Duluth's Canal Park, or 15 miles from Two
Harbors. Parking is free for day visitors.</p>
<p><em>Park programs</em> : The park naturalist leads many hikes and nature
programs. On Presidents' Day weekend in February, there's a
candlelight ski, snowshoe and hike with music and treats.</p>
<p><em>Lighted skiing</em> : The nine kilometers of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/2harborsskitrail/">Erkki Harju Ski
Trail</a> in Two HarborsÂ 
includes a very nice, easy three-kilometer loop that's lighted.
Donations help the local ski club maintain it. It's less than a mile
from Minnesota 61, off County Road 2.</p>

Shore</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/snowshoeing-north-shore/">North Shore by
snowshoe</a>. Many popular trails, such as
the five-mile Split Rock River Loop, part of the Superior Hiking Trail,
become so packed that snowshoes aren't necessary.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : <a href="http://www.gooseberry.com/">Gooseberry Trailside
Suites</a>, adjoining Gooseberry Falls State
Park, has four attractive two-bedroom suites, each with wood-burning
fireplace, VCR, CD player, deck and full kitchen. There's a big sauna
and a ski-waxing room outside.</p>
<p><a href="https://bellsheephomestead.com/">Bell Sheep Homestead</a>, formerly J
Gregers Inn, across from the park, has four rooms, all with fridges and
microwaves, one with fireplace and two with two beds and kitchens, and a
cabin for two with fireplace.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.castlehaven.net/">Castle Haven Cabins</a>, 12 miles east of
Two Harbors, has 12 two-bedroom cabins right on the lake, and seven have
wood-burning fireplaces.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.superiorshores.com/">Superior Shores</a>, one mile north of
Two Harbors, is a large complex of hotel rooms, studios, suites and
townhouses, with two outdoor pools, one indoor pool, two saunas, a
whirlpool, tennis courts, and restaurant with patio.</p>
<p><em>Dining</em> : The <a href="https://rusticinn.cafe/">Rustic Inn</a>, known for its
pies, is just three miles south of the park in Castle Danger.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://superiorshores.com/dining/">Shore Grill &amp; Bar</a> at Superior
Shores Resort, 12 miles south of Gooseberry, would be a nice stop after
an evening on the lighted Two Harbors loop.</p>
