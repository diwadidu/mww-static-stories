<p>In winter, it's hard to find a lodge getaway that fits every budget.</p>
<p>Lodges that offer skiing on groomed trails, wood-fired saunas and
home-cooked meals aren't cheap.</p>
<p>But if you'd like to try those things-and be greeted by a plate of
warm chocolate-chip cookies afterward-you have a friend in
environmental learning centers.</p>
<p>These non-profit centers are the low-cost Club Meds of the north woods,
offering all-inclusive weekend packages that include lodgings, meals and
winter fun-cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, ice fishing, even
wolf-tracking and sled-dog mushing.</p>
