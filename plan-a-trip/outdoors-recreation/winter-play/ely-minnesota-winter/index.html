<p>Around Ely, beauty is stripped down to essentials.</p>
<p>There's little but water, stone, spruce and sky in the northern
Minnesota wilderness, what conservationist Sigurd Olson called &quot;the
naked grandeur.&quot; Still, it enthralls visitors from all over the world.</p>
<p>In winter, snow, ice and silence settle over the forests and lakes, and
stars plaster the inky night sky. For many, Ely's pull is even stronger
then.</p>
<p>&quot;Most of us who live here do find winter to be our favorite season,&quot;
says longtime inn proprietor Jo Kovach.</p>
<p>&quot;It's peaceful, tranquil and beautiful — I often talk about how
noisy it is when the trees first leaf out in the spring and you hear the
roaring of the millions of acres of trees around us. But the only sound
you hear in winter is the birds and this wonderful silence.&quot;</p>
<p>Ely is famous for being the favorite destination of such celebrities as
Charles Kuralt and the chosen home of photographer Jim Brandenburg,
Sigurd Olson and polar explorers Will Steger and Paul Schurke. People
who see it tend to love it — but not always.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>One winter, a Seattle family of four landed in Ely, the first winners of
a reality show called &quot;The Vacation You Need,&quot; produced for the Travel
Channel. The family thought they'd won a beach vacation but ended up
with a sled-dog camping trip from Schurke's Wintergreen Lodge, a
well-known outfitter to which people flock from all over the world.</p>
<p>The first impulse of the family from Seattle, however, was to flee.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a real eye-opener for us to realize there are people out there
for whom this is truly, absolutely not their cup of tea,&quot; Schurke said.
&quot;The father was angry. The mother was upset. The daughter had an iPod
in one ear and a cell phone in the other, and I don't think they came
out the whole trip.&quot;</p>
<p>But Ely was at its most dazzling, with sun sparkling on a layer of new
snow, and eventually the family came around. They learned how to use a
compass, and the mother and daughter won an orienteering challenge.</p>
<p>The daughter was first to jump through the ice after a soak in the
sauna, and the son asked if he could apply for an internship with
Schurke.</p>
<p>And while most clients fall in love with the sled dogs, Schurke said,
these fell in love with the stars.</p>
<p>&quot;We take this for granted up here, but they were absolutely enchanted
with the night sky,&quot; he said. &quot;They were out on the lake most every
evening, wanting us to identify the various constellations.&quot;</p>

Bound trip.

<h3>Hobnobbing with sled dogs</h3>
<p>Sometimes, people arrive with the stars stuck firmly in their eyes.</p>
<p>When we were in Ely one February, we stayed at an inn with four people
on a Wintergreen trip. They were enthralled with the dogs: &quot;They're so
wonderful,&quot; said Lynne Olds of Campbell, Calif. &quot;They have such
personality, and they work so hard, it's just a pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p>In the morning, we watched them help guides Chris Maher and Mark Schurke
harness teams of Canadian Inuit dogs, each capable of pulling 550
pounds.</p>
<p>&quot;If people are fit, we can take them on a crazy wild ride,&quot; said
Schurke, Paul's nephew. &quot;If they just want a leisurely ride through
the woods, we can do that, too.&quot;</p>
<p>After watching the sleds hurtle across South Farm Lake and into the
forest, with Schurke flying ahead on skis, we borrowed some of the Blue
Heron's snowshoes and headed to the North Arm of Burntside Lake.</p>
<p>From the parking lot, we snowshoed through a magnificent old-growth
forest and up the ridge above Slim Lake until we reached Old Baldy, a
quartzite outcropping where we sat in a warm breeze, a panorama of
forests and lakes spread beneath us.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>That was our second snowshoe trek of the weekend. During Winter
Festival, the Ely office of Outward Bound usually leads a trip to the
pictographs on North Hegman Lake.</p>
<p>With three leaders and 17 other people, we trudged up from South Hegman
Lake, the slushy lake ice slurping at our snowshoes, until we were
standing in front of the ancient red figures.</p>
<p>Drawn on rock 500 or 1,000 years ago, they depict a moose, an otterlike
animal, a figure that may be human or superhuman and perhaps some
constellations — no one knows for sure.</p>
<p>We did, however, know what had made the tracks in the snow that crossed
and meandered past our own tracks — thanks to Laura Prugh, a biologist
from Vancouver, British Columbia, who earned her doctorate tracking
coyotes in Alaska.</p>
<p>&quot;That's the great thing about winter; everything leaves a trace,&quot;
Prugh said.</p>
<h3>Sculpting in snow</h3>
<p>In Ely's Whiteside Park, teams of sculptors were trying to make their
mark in the snow, too, but the warmth was taxing their patience.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/ely_hegman_pictographs.jpg" alt="Hegman Lake pictographs in Ely." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Ancient pictographs can be seen along North Hegman Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Anne DesLauriers of Ely was one of three women working on a piece called
&quot;Going With the Flow,&quot; and &quot;yesterday, it was almost literally
flowing,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Grant Harrison had made a piece he dubbed &quot;Mountain Lions Don't Like
Warm Weather.&quot; &quot;I completed it at 12:50 a.m., and it collapsed at
12:51 a.m.,&quot; he said. &quot;It was awesome.&quot;</p>
<p>In the professional categories, one of the most striking pieces was
&quot;Ravenous,&quot; a classical sculpture of a raven picking at a tipped-over
basket of fruit.</p>
<p>&quot;We're all artists in regular life, so it's nice to do something
fun,&quot; said frame-shop owner Penny Perry.</p>
<p>The warm temperatures were good for roaming Sheridan Street, however,
and shoppers were hopping from sale to sale, perusing the northwoods
goods at Steger Mukluks, Piragis and Wintergreen Designs. Even the
Brandenburg Gallery was having a White Sale, 25 percent off any print or
card that featured snow or ice.</p>
<p>In Ely, Jim Brandenburg's spectacular assemblage of photographs is
right up there with the International Wolf Center as a town attraction.</p>
<p>Somehow, Brandenburg is able to capture moments in nature that most
people have never seen, much less photographed — northern lights in a
tie-dyed sky, a baby snowshoe hare yawning in the sun, a timber wolf
sitting in a pool of light on the side of a shadowy mountain.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/ely_snow_sculpture_mouth.jpg" alt="A yawning mouth is made of snow in Ely's Whiteside Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>After mingling with the mukluk-shod, parka-clad crowds on Sheridan
Street, we headed for the International Wolf Center, home of real wolves.</p>
<p>After scrutinizing a map that showed the whereabouts of the local wolves
— one of them, a 78-pound male, was last pinpointed around the Blue
Heron, and two young females were nearby — we watched a film about the
reintroduction of wolves at Yellowstone.</p>
<p>The subplots — about a submissive &quot;Cinderella sister&quot; and an outcast
male — were fascinating, a story of playground politics on a
life-or-death scale.</p>
<p>&quot;The roles in the pack are never stagnant,&quot; naturalist Erin
Albers told us. &quot;They're always being reinforced, they're always being
tested.&quot;</p>
<h3>Drama with wolves</h3>
<p>To those who watch, the latest celebrity news is a snoozer compared with
the goings-on in the pack.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In a wolf pack, attitude matters more than size. In 2005, the 1-year-old
female Nyssa had grown larger than her sister Maya. But when workers
were building a rock wall for the habitat, the normally feisty Nyssa
showed fear of the wheelbarrow, and her packmates likely perceived it as
a weakness.</p>
<p>That spring, Maya may have dealt with her larger sister for good: Six
days after she and Nyssa were spayed, Nyssa was found with injuries from
an attack so severe she had to be euthanized. Maya became the dominant
female until her death in 2011.</p>
<p>But aggression without leadership can doom a wolf, too. In 2016, the
4-year-old Great Plains wolf Luna had to be retired because of her
intense behavior toward two new Arctic gray wolf pups, Greyson and Axel.</p>
<p>We were lucky; we got to see all of the wolves, sometimes nearly
nose-to-nose but for the plate-glass wall that separates the small
auditorium from their home.</p>
<p>In addition to Greyson and Axel, the exhibit pack includes Rieka, born in 2021, and Blackstone and Caz, born in 2022.</p>
<p>Winter is a good time to watch the wolves, who often retreat to the
shade of trees in summer.</p>
<p>Ely may be best known for summer canoeing and sky-blue waters. Blue is
good, in its time. But in winter, white is the welcome color.</p>
