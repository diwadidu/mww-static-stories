<h2>Along rivers and lakes, it's fun to hang out with Jack Frost.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/e/tettegouche_ice6.jpg" alt="Ice at Tettegouche." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In winter, ice comes with the territory. You can curse it — or you can
play with it.</p>
<p>Kids know how. Climbers and skaters know how. And photographers adore
it.</p>
<p>Having fun with ice also is a good way to cope with a winter that drags
on, endlessly, into April.</p>
<p>That's when gigantic heaps of shards pile up on Lake Superior and ice
storms create glistening tableaux that make photographers come running.</p>
<p>Once, I considered ice the mere byproduct of conditions too poor to
produce snow. That was before I really looked at it. On north-woods
rivers and lakes, ice glazes snow into all kinds of magical shapes.</p>
<p>One year, after an ice storm turned northern Wisconsin ski trails into
screaming luge runs, I cut short a ski weekend and headed home through
glazed forest. But Amnicon Falls State Park was on the way, so I stopped
to explore.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the summer, the Amnicon River is a jolly little stream that tumbles
over a series of waterfalls as it splits around a wooded island.</p>
<p>In winter, the river is frozen in place and the park is silent, but
there's a palpable sense of suppressed energy, straining under the
opaque marble pillars that once were rushing torrents.</p>
<p>As I made my way along the shore, admiring ice formations, nothing
moved. Then, I noticed what appeared to be a heap of ashes at the base
of Snakepit Falls.</p>
<p>It was heaving and sighing as if an asthmatic giant were lying just
underneath, puffing life into this Mount St. Helens on ice.</p>
<p>I was itching to touch it but afraid to get too close, so I fetched a
long stick and gave it a poke. Poof — my little volcano turned out to
be nothing but frozen foam, quickly scattered to the wind.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/split_rock_ice.jpg" alt="Ice at Split Rock." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A piece of ice found in Split Rock Lighthouse State Park on Lake
Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Ice is strange. A whisper of wind or droplet of mist is all it needs to
shift shapes — and, like snowflakes, it never takes on the same shape
twice.</p>
<p>Now, I consider a good icescape to be a main destination. My favorite
is the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore ice caves on Wisconsin's
Bayfield Peninsula. I visit them every year that Lake Superior freezes
enough to allow people to walk along its shores.</p>
<p>Gooseberry Falls on Minnesota's North Shore always is worth a stop for
its filmy curtains of icicles, which create niches and tunnels children
love to explore.</p>
<p>All of the North Shore rivers are gorgeous. Walking on the shallow
Kadunce near Grand Marais, I once spied elfin strings of tea lights
strung under thick slabs of snow. On the nearby Brule, shiny minarets
topped flowing tapestries of ice.</p>
<p>If it's near water, any summer playground is even more fun in winter: A
pile of ice is a jungle gym, swing set and merry-go-round all rolled
into one.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_ice_corridor.jpg" alt="Ice-covered breakwall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Art at Artists' Point</h3>
<p>Late one winter, I went out to Artists Point in Grand Marais, popular
in summer for its piles of cobblestones that can be stacked into cairns
and arches. But in winter, there was more to play with.</p>
<p>On the village side of the point, thin slices of ice lay in pointy heaps
that mimicked the Sawtooth Mountains rising behind the village; they
were so transparent, I lifted one to my camera and used it as a filter.</p>
<p>On the lake side, chunks of ice were strewn like Lucite paperweights.
One was in the shape of Minnesota, its southern half a skein of tiny
fractures, and its northern half so clear it refracted the sun into
dancing rays of purple, yellow and blue.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Usually, wind and snow make surfaces rounded and dull, like jade.</p>
<p>But on this day in Grand Marais, the ice was as sharp-edged and clear as
art glass, and walking on the beach was like walking through a gallery:
I spotted a Picasso hen, a Chihuly chandelier, an Orrefors vase.</p>
<p>On the bay, craters of ice rode the waves like jellyfish, bashing each
other's edges into tinsel. But in the harbor, the water was unnaturally
motionless — only the presence of gulls, sitting just a little too
high, gave away the fact that it was frozen.</p>
<p>I could have played there all day, examining each piece as if it were
the rarest thing in the world. I wanted to take some home, but there's
no such thing as a souvenir from an ice field.</p>
<p>But the memories will last for a long time.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Northwoods ice playgrounds</h3>
<p>Anywhere there's water and rock, there will be ice formations.</p>
<p>Always be careful when walking on rivers and lakes; to be safe, ask a
local naturalist for advice, bring a buddy and carry a stick that you
can tuck under your arms horizontally if you fall in.</p>
<p>Thick snow is no guarantee of safety; it's an insulator and may be
keeping water from freezing.</p>
<p>For safety, wear spikes or other traction devices on your boots. For
recommendations, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/ice-hiking-crampons-grippers/">Walking on ice</a>.</p>
<p>Formations are most delicate when the air is very cold, but the sunnier
days of late winter, until the ice breaks up in late March or early
April, are a perfect time to play.</p>

<h3>Tettegouche ice forest</h3>
<p>On Minnesota North Shore, the Tettegouche State Park campground along
Lake Superior often becomes a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150162879570129.339344.104777055128&amp;type=3">magical ice
forest</a>
after storms, when waves splash up and over the cliffs, glazing tree
branches and bushes.</p>
<h3>Artists' Point in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Grand Marais</a></h3>
<p>This wooded spit of land on the east side of the harbor, beyond the U.S.
old Coast Guard station, is fun to explore in any season.</p>
<p>For more, see our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/album.php?id=104777055128&amp;aid=310203">Facebook
album</a>.</p>
<h3>Stoney Point near the Knife River</h3>
<p>Fifteen miles from Duluth on old Minnesota 61, waves slam this part of
the North Shore, pushing enormous slabs of ice into piles.</p>
<p>Surfers ride the biggest waves, and storm-watchers come to watch them
pound tractor-sized boulders along the shore.</p>
<p>It's just past the New Scenic Cafe. Turn onto Stoney Point Drive. For
more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/north-shore-scenic-highway/">Minnesota's scenic
61</a>.</p>

<h3>North Shore rivers and <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/waterfalls-north-shore-minnesota/">waterfalls</a></h3>
<p><em>Gooseberry Falls State Park</em> is a favorite place to clamber around,
with dramatic, varied ice terrain.</p>
<p>The water around Lower and Middle Falls isn't too deep, but be careful
around Upper Falls, which has a 20-foot pool at its base.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/gooseberry-falls/">Gooseberries on ice</a>.</p>
<p>Four miles east of Gooseberry at the mouth of the <em>Split Rock River,</em>  a
five-mile hiking trail goes up the west side of the river and crosses a
bridge to return along a ridge and back to the highway.</p>
<p>Not far from the start, there's a 20-foot waterfall around the corner
from the first bridge.</p>
<p>A few miles down the road, the cove below the famous <em>Split Rock
Lighthouse</em> is a fun place to play on the rocks.</p>
<p>Past Lutsen, there are many formations on the rapids and falls of the
<em>Cascade River.</em></p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/banning_icefall.jpg" alt="Frozen waterfall in Banning State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Banning State Park, explorers can duck behind Wolf Creek Falls.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Past Grand Marais, the first sections of the <em>Devil Track</em> and <em>Kadunce
rivers</em> can be traversed in winter, through picturesque red gorges
dripping with icicles.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/banning/index.html">Banning State Park</a> near Sandstone</h3>
<p>Banning is right off Interstate 35, halfway between the Twin Cities and
Duluth.</p>
<p>It's a lovely snowshoe hike to Wolf Creek Falls, near the Kettle River.
There aren't caves, but you can walk behind an impressive icefall.</p>
<h2>WISCONSIN</h2>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/amnicon/">Amnicon Falls State Park</a> near Superior</h3>
<p>The falls in this state park, 10 miles east of Superior on U.S. 2, are
very easy to explore. A covered bridge allows access to the island,
which is encircled by a series of frozen rapids.</p>
<h3>Northwest Wisconsin waterfalls</h3>
<p>Thirteen miles south of Superior, Pattison State Park has the
fourth-highest waterfall east of the Rockies and is easily reached.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/wisconsin-waterfalls/">Waterfalls of northern
Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<h3>Apostle Islands National Lakeshore ice caves</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mawikwe_blue_ice.jpg" alt="Blue icefall at ice caves." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the mainland ice caves near Cornucopia, Wis., a giant icefall is
tinted blue and pink.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The mainland ice caves, four miles east of Cornucopia off Meyers Beach
Road, are magnificent — like an underground cave turned inside out,
except that many of the formations are in delicate hues of blue and
green.</p>
<p>However, Lake Superior doesn't always freeze hard enough to allow the
one-mile walk from the Meyers Beach parking lot. In fact, it hasn't 
frozen hard enough to allow mass travel to the caves since 2014.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/ice-caves-apostles/">Ice caves of the Apostles</a>.</p>
<p>An option would be to walk or snowshoe the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/hiking.htm">Lakeshore
Trail</a> along the
cliff top, which goes to the caves from Meyers Beach. Be sure to keep a
good grip on kids.</p>
<h2>MICHIGAN'S UPPER PENINSULA</h2>

<h3>Black River waterfalls near Bessemer</h3>
<p>This is the top destination of Patrick Lisi, a Wisconsin game warden
whose book &quot;Wisconsin Waterfalls&quot; is the bible for waterfall watchers.</p>
<p>From Bessemer, eight waterfalls tumble down the Black River as it heads
toward Lake Superior. They're along the North Country National Scenic
Trail and off County Road 513.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/black-river-michigan/">Waterfalls by
snowshoe</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/michigan-pictured-rocks-national-lakeshore/">Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore</a></h3>
<p>Between Munising and Sand Point, there are several <a href="https://www.nps.gov/piro/learn/nature/ice-caves-and-ice-formations.htm">ice columns and
curtains</a>
that form &quot;caves,&quot; as well as frozen waterfalls.</p>
<p>Along Sand Point Road, park in the lots at Sand Point Beach or Munising
Falls and walk to the formations. It's a good idea to bring ice cleats.</p>
<h3>Eben Ice Caves near Pictured Rocks</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EbenIceCaves/">Eben Ice Caves</a> form in
the Rock River Canyon. They're southwest of Au Train, about six miles
from Lake Superior. It's a mile round-trip on well-packed snow.</p>
<p>Again, bring ice cleats for exploring the caves.</p>
