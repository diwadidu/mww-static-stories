A team explodes from the starting line.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Long before reality shows turned survival into a stunt, there was John
Beargrease.</p>
<p>With no fanfare and no road, the Ojibwe man delivered the weekly mail
between Two Harbors and Grand Marais until 1899, using a dog team in
winter. Using only four dogs to pull packs of up to 700 pounds,
Beargrease could make the round-trip in a few days.</p>
<p>His stamina spawned a legend. Now mushers from around the nation come to
trace his path, racing each other from Duluth to the Gunflint Trail in
the John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon.</p>
<p>For four days, they race around the clock, often running alongside their
dogs and barely sleeping. But as grueling as the race is, it rewards not
so much the strong as the canny — and the canines, because this race
is all about dogs.</p>
<p>The Beargrease mushers are interesting people. But it's the dogs who
sink a hook into innocent spectators, often turning them into helpless
groupies.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Their spooky ice-blue eyes and maniacal energy make them mesmerizing to
watch.</p>
<p>Seemingly too small and lean to pull anything, the dogs are bred for
toughness and are as carefully trained, drilled and molded as Chinese
gymnasts. At the Beargrease, announcers call them &quot;canine athletes,&quot;
not dogs.</p>
<p>Of the more than 900 canine athletes at the starting line of a
Beargrease, at least 895 of them are literally at the ends of their
ropes, jumping out of their skins with excitement.</p>
<p>Yelping as if in agony, they dance on their back feet as handlers
struggle to hold them back. Some lead dog lurch ahead every two seconds
like clockwork, until their ganglines finally go slack and their musher
yells &quot;Hike.&quot;</p>
<p>Then mushers hang on for dear life as their dogs explode down the fenced
chute and around the first corner.</p>
<p>The sight of one team after another catapulting out of the starting line
is one of the more thrilling sights in sports.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_meet_mushers.jpg" alt="Beargrease meet 'n' greet." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Before the race start, mushers bring out their dogs for a meet-and-greet
session with spectators.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A few minutes of watching this and spectators start to catch the bug:
Who will come out on top? Who will fade? What will happen? Where can I
watch some more?</p>
<p>Many people jump in their cars and follow the teams, staking out spots
along the trail where they can see them go by.</p>
<p>&quot;There are these little shelters up and down the trail for snowmobilers,
and each one is full of people with hot dogs and hot chocolate,&quot; says
Jack Welsh, a longtime volunteer coordinator who once kept a team of dogs. &quot;Oh,
yeah, it's contagious.&quot;</p>
<p>One year, my husband Torsten and I volunteered for Welsh at the Trail
Center on the Gunflint Trail, so we could see more of the dogs and
mushers.</p>
<p>After we watched the start, we drove up the shore and along the Gunflint
Trail to the Poplar Creek Guesthouse, run by Ted and Barbara Young just
across Poplar Lake from the Trail Center.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>A musher himself, Ted competed in the Gunflint Mail Run, the predecessor
of the Beargrease. Barb Young sewed the mailbags carried by racers,
still a race tradition. They're both admirers of the 19th-century
mailman.</p>
<p>&quot;The Pony Express did it for 18 months; he did it for 20 years,&quot; Ted
Young said.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, the Youngs gave us the latest race standings. Five
teams already had reached the Sawbill checkpoint, where they had to
spend six hours without help from handlers.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we met Welsh and the other volunteers at the Trail
Center to hang sponsor banners, haul wood for the bonfire and shovel
snow to make a chute from the lake into the parking lot.</p>
<p>In the Trail Center, a former 1930s logging camp adorned with moose
racks, old tin signs and antique saws, ham-radio operators listened for
the latest news.</p>
<p>As we waited for the teams to arrive, the other volunteers, all
experienced mushers, told us why the sport is so addictive.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/beargrease_heidipinkerton2.jpg" alt="A musher on the Beargrease." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Heidi Pinkerton</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;It's so fun,&quot; said Patty Prudden of Duluth. &quot;The dogs are an extension
of you; it's you and those little critters. There's so much trust.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Out in the woods, it's so quiet,&quot; Welsh said. &quot;They make a lot of
noise when they start, but later they're quiet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's why you can get so close to a moose and see the eagles,&quot;
Prudden added.</p>
<p>A little after 7 p.m., we saw a headlamp winking across Poplar Lake; it
was August Galloway, then a rookie from the Iron Range.</p>
<p>Her handlers already had shoveled out a chute in the snow near the lake
and lined it with straw; her dogs ran right in and lay down, while
Galloway cooked some watery mash over a little cook stove, fed them,
covered them with blankets and rubbed their legs.</p>
<p>Galloway was followed by Frank Teasley, a mushing veteran from Jackson
Hole, Wyo., and rookie Blake Freking. Liz Busa called out the time, I
wrote it down and Torsten ran to get the bib number and count the dogs;
mushers start with 14, and when one dog drops out, they cannot replace it.</p>
<p>Then Sally Bair had the musher sign a slip listing the time and number
of dogs.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/beargrease_dogs_jasonmandich.jpg" alt="Sled dogs resting." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Jason Mandich</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Beargrease rookie Mary Black soon arrived, followed by Rachael Scdoris,
a legally blind young woman from Bend, Ore., who was negotiating the
turns with the help of a friend, running just ahead of her with a
two-way radio.</p>
<p>We went in for dinner around 10 p.m., then returned to the bonfire to
wait. John Stearley had driven 17 hours from southern Indiana to watch
the race and spend two weeks at his cabin on the edge of the BWCA. At
first, he said, the family came only in summer.</p>
<p>&quot;Then one day my son said, 'I wonder what it's like in winter,' &quot;
Stearley said. &quot;I said, 'Oh, you don't want to come in winter, it's
brutal.' But we came so I could teach him a lesson, thinking he'd be
turned off, but we were both turned on.&quot;</p>
<p>For a while, all was quiet. But Busa said there was plenty going on that
we couldn't see.</p>
<p>&quot;The people at the top of the pack watch each other like mad,&quot; she
said. &quot;When the mushers are sleepin', the handlers are spyin'.&quot;</p>
<p>At 1 a.m., Freking walked up and quietly asked for a bag check at his
camp; before mushers leave a checkpoint, volunteers must verify that
their bags contain mandatory gear, including the mailbag, two headlamps,
rations and safety equipment.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It bought him a few minutes, but by the time he left, his dogs were
howling and the other mushers knew the game was afoot.</p>
<p>It rattled Frank Teasley, a previous Beargrease winner, who left after
checking Busa's watch and arguing with Bair about timing. Then veteran
musher Keith Aili left, followed by Galloway.</p>
<p>No one budged after that, and we left the checkpoint to the regulars,
happy to sit into the wee hours.</p>
<p>The next day, we strapped on snowshoes and spent the afternoon in the
Boundary Waters, using canoe portages to travel from the glittering
white expanses of Caribou Lake to Lizz Lake and then back to Poplar and
the Banadad Trail.</p>
<p>We returned to the Trail Center for dinner Tuesday evening. Proprietor
Sarah Hamilton was at the front desk feeding her Rottweiler puppy a
plate of Alaskan pollock and sauteed veggies. She still hadn't been to
bed after the big night, but she looked happy.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/u/musher_dogs_trail.jpg" alt="A musher comes down the trail with his dogs on the North Sho" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;The Beargrease started up here, just a bunch of locals having fun,&quot;
she said. &quot;Then somebody took it over and took it to Duluth, and they
didn't even know it was our idea. So we're thrilled to have it back
here.&quot;</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, the Youngs handed us a printout. By the next to
last checkpoint, the status quo was holding: Freking, Teasley, Aili,
Galloway, Black.</p>
<p>When we got back to Duluth, we heard Freking had easily won with his
team of Siberian huskies, seldom-used race dogs that Jack Welsh had
earlier dismissed as &quot;Slow-berians.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't notice how many dogs he had left; I was too busy eating my
words,&quot; Welsh said with a smile.</p>
<p>Freking had pulled what race coordinator Alex Angelos called a &quot;Jamie
Nelson&quot; move, after the four-time Beargrease (1988, '95 and '97-'98)
winner: Stay a few places back, make sure your dogs get plenty of rest,
then move ahead on the downbound leg, forcing other mushers to change
plans.</p>
<p>&quot;If you can pull the other mushers off their strategy, things start to
unfold, and they might make some changes,&quot; Angelos said. &quot;Sometimes it
works to their advantage, but usually it doesn't.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/beargrease_finish.jpg" alt="A musher at the Beargrease finish line." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Aili came in more than two hours later, followed by Teasley and Mary
Black. But Galloway's dogs had gone on strike not far from the finish,
and she had to scratch.</p>
<p>&quot;She made the typical rookie mistake, running her dogs too hard off the
start,&quot; Welsh said.</p>
<p>But he had to eat his words again when Rachael Scdoris arrived, not only
placing sixth but coming across the finish line with nine of her
original dogs, more than any of the other top finishers.</p>
<p>&quot;Every race has a little different flavor,&quot; says Angelos, longtime race
coordinator  and now a race judge.</p>
<p>Angelos uses the same word everyone does to describe the Beargrease:
addictive.</p>
<p>&quot;I've been out long enough that you get the bug, and then you feel
dangerous: 'I could do that,' &quot; he says ruefully. &quot;And then you work a
while as a volunteer and a handler, and you realize, there's no way I
could do that.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: <a href="http://www.beargrease.com/">John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon</a></h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  The race was shortened in 2019 and now starts at
Billy's Bar on the edge of Duluth and ends in Grand Portage Lodge &amp;
Casino, a 300-mile race.</p>
<p>The 120-mile race ends at Lutsen Mountains, and
the 40-mile race ends in Two Harbors.</p>
<p>Check conditions before you go. To get to Billy's, take Superior Street
to 43rd Avenue East and go left to Glenwood Avenue. Take a left at
Glenwood and go to Jean Duluth Road. Take a right at Jean Duluth Road
and drive to Tischer Road.</p>
<p>There's a free parking and a shuttle from the University of Minnesota-Duluth Lot W in Duluth.</p>
<p><em>Race events:</em> The race is held the last Sunday in January, with events
all weekend. On race day, spectators can meet the mushers at 8 a.m. The
race starts at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Marathon mushers leave first, followed by the 120 and then 40 racers. The first musher is expected to reach Grand Portage late Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Be sure to buy a program. It includes the bib numbers of the mushers,
which you'll need to know whom you're seeing farther down the route.</p>
<p><em>Watching along the route:</em> Because mushers can choose how long they
will spend at most checkpoints, it's hard to predict when they'll arrive
at any one place. Temperatures also affect the race; when it's warm,
mushers try to run mostly at night, when it's cooler.</p>
<p>It's essential to dress warmly if you'll be standing around waiting.
Wear twice as much as you think you'll need and bring chemical hand and
feet warmers, available at hardware and home-supply stores.</p>
<p><em>Volunteering:</em>  Nearly 1,000 volunteers are needed to do everything
from tabulating &quot;Cutest Puppy&quot; votes to moving sponsor banners up and
down the trail to helping teams cross highways.</p>
