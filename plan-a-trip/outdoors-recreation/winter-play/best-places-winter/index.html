<h2>Here are dozens of ways to savor the chilly season.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/e/tettegouche_ice6.jpg" alt="Ice at Tettegouche." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Ice coats a clifftop opposite Shovel Point in Minnesota's Tettegouche
State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's a reason why winter is the favorite season of many
photographers — it's gorgeous.</p>
<p>You've seen this region's icicle-draped sea caves, volcanic Great
Lakes waves and dancing northern lights on social media. Now get out
there and enjoy the scenery yourselves.</p>
<p>Snowshoe up frozen river canyons, barrel through the woods behind a team
of huskies and go to bock festivals at breweries. Learn to ice fish,
track wolves and look for bald eagles.</p>
<p>Or be like the Finns, Danes and Norwegians, who regularly land on top of
the <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2022/">World Happiness Report</a>.
In winter, they enjoy <em>hygge</em> — the cozy well-being felt by lighting
candles, sitting in front of crackling fires and having warm drinks with
friends. Try that yourselves, or go to the Hygge Festival in Grand
Marais in February.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Winter is fun! Here are our picks for the best things to do outdoors in
<em>2023.</em></p>
<p>And if you're worried about the cold, here's our guide to <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/warm-winter-clothes/">staying
warm</a>. There's no such thing as bad weather,
only bad clothes.</p>
<h3>Playing in the snow</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/candlelight-ski-snowshoe-events/">Candlelight skiing and
snowshoeing</a></strong></p>
<p>There's nothing more magical than making your way through a forest
filled with light, or more thrilling than starting down a shadowy hill,
hoping your skis stay in the groomed tracks (they always do).</p>
<p>Among the best candlelight events: the ones in Minnesota's Mille
Lacs-Kathio State Park <em>Feb. 4</em> and, in Wisconsin, on the Red Cedar
State Trail <em>Jan. 27.</em></p>
<p>The biggest candlelight party is <a href="http://www.batb.org/">Book
Across the Bay</a> between Ashland and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/book-across-bay/">Washburn</a>, Wis., <em>Feb.
18.</em> Anyone can take part in this popular ski or snowshoe trek across
flat Chequamegon Bay, on a 10-kilometer route lined by 1,000 ice
luminaries and a bonfire every kilometer.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/north_shore_mushing.jpg" alt="Mushing in Superior National Forest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Mushing through Superior National Forest in northeast Minnesota.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you're not too fast, fireworks will fill the sky as you're
approaching Washburn; a bonfire, chili feed and live music follow.</p>
<p>You also can make your own course with friends; see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/making-ice-luminarias/">How to make ice
luminaries</a>.</p>
<p>For extra illumination, go out during a full moon, Jan. 6, Feb. 5 and
March 7 in 2023.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/dog-sledding/">Sled-dog mushing</a></strong></p>
<p>Nothing says &quot;north woods&quot; more than a team of huskies pulling a sled.
It's pretty much the most fun you can have in winter, especially if you
drive the sled instead of sitting in the basket.</p>
<p>It's not cheap, so save up for a special occasion. Look for mushing
outfits in Ely, along Minnesota's North Shore and across the north
woods. Reserve in advance.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/n/onion_river_icefall.jpg" alt="An icefall on the Onion River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Icefalls adorn the sides of the Onion River canyon in northeast
Minnesota.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-rivers-north-shore/">Snowshoeing river
canyons</a></strong></p>
<p>On snowshoes, you can really go places.</p>
<p>On Minnesota's North Shore of Lake Superior, the slot canyons of the
Onion River near Tofte and Devil Track near Grand Marais, inaccessible
when the water is flowing, are fun to explore.</p>
<p>Near Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, on the U.P., the <a href="http://www.michigan.org/blog/guest-blogger/exploring-the-eben-ice-caves-in-michigans-upper-peninsula/">Eben ice
caves</a>
also are a popular destination.</p>
<p><strong>Looking for northern lights</strong></p>
<p>Along Lake Superior, the aurora borealis has been showing up with
amazing regularity.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Marquette photographer Shawn Malone of Lake Superior Photo offers tips
for <a href="http://www.travelmarquettemichigan.com/5-tips-to-see-the-northern-lights/">finding and
photographing</a>
them, and smartphone apps alert you to the best opportunities in real
time.</p>
<p>If you join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/greatlakesaurorahunters/">Great Lakes Aurora Hunters Facebook
page</a>,
you'll get alerts.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/snow-tubing-midwest/">Tubing hills</a></strong></p>
<p>With their multiple lanes, conveyor lifts and snow-making, today's
tubing hills are nothing like the ones your grandma had.</p>
<p>The great thing about tubing is that anyone can do it. There's no
learning curve, it's not expensive and the only gear required is warm
clothing. You'll find them everywhere, in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa,
Illinois and Michigan.</p>
<h3>Watching and photographing birds</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_great_gray_owl.jpg" alt="A great gray owl outside Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A great gray owl sat in a churchyard just outside Duluth.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/owl-hunting-northern-minnesota/">Owl-watching</a></strong></p>
<p>Snowy owl irruptions once came only every few years, but the photogenic
owls now arrive every year.  Boreal and great gray owls also are regular
visitors around the western Great Lakes.</p>
<p>Not far from Duluth, the <a href="http://www.saxzim.org/">Sax-Zim Bog</a>
is one of the best places to find owls of all kinds. There's a small
welcome center staffed by volunteers in winter, who also offer <a href="https://saxzim.org/events/">field trips</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/where-to-find-eagles/">Eagle-watching</a></strong></p>
<p>Bald eagles aren't as cute as huskies, but they're a thrill to watch.
You'll find them picking off fish at the base of dams, at the mouths of
rivers and at the many <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagle-watching-mississippi-river/">eagle-watching
festivals</a> around the
region.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/swans-monticello-minnesota/">Swan-watching</a></strong></p>
<p>And then you have trumpeter swans, who are nearly as noisy as huskies
before a run and really easy to spot if you go to a certain spot in the
Minnesota town of Monticello, where a power plant warms the Mississippi
River an hour northwest of the Twin Cities.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/a/sandstone_ice_debra_lauren.jpg" alt="Ice climbing in Sandstone." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Lauren Gagner</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A beginner learns the ropes at Sandstone's Ice Festival.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The swans think it's a spa. They arrive from the north in late November and stay through
February.</p>
<h3>Exploring an icescape</h3>
<p><strong>Learn how to ice climb</strong></p>
<p>Experts show novices the ropes at clinics during the <a href="https://sandstoneicefest.com/">Sandstone Ice
Festival</a> in eastern Minnesota on <em>Jan.
6-8,</em> the <a href="https://www.duluthclimbers.org/ice-fest">Duluth Ice &amp; Mixed
Fest</a> on <em>Feb. 4</em> in
Duluth, and the <a href="http://www.michiganicefest.com/">Michigan Ice Fest</a> on
<em>Feb. 8-12</em> near Munising, Mich. Participants can borrow gear.</p>
<p>You can also book a private <a href="http://www.iceclimbmichigan.com/">ice-climbing
adventure</a> with Michigan Ice Fest
guides in the Upper Peninsula.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/ice-caves-apostles/">Ice caves of the Apostles</a></strong></p>
<p>People start calling the hot line of Wisconsin's Apostle Islands
National Lakeshore in January, hoping to hear the magic words:
&quot;Conditions do allow access&quot; to the mainland sea caves near
Cornucopia.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's a mile's walk or snowshoe over frozen Lake Superior to the ice
caves. But visitors are rewarded by a constantly shifting spectacle of
ice stalactites and columns, often tinted blue, green and pink, and
caves dripping with icicles.</p>
<p>Dress warmly and hope for cheek-tingling temperatures; that's when the
formations are most beautiful.</p>
<p>In recent years, the lake ice hasn't frozen enough to allow a safe walk
to the caves, but you can walk above them on the two-mile, clifftop
Lakeshore Trail.</p>
<p>Or, visit the inland <a href="https://www.facebook.com/EbenIceCaves/">Eben Ice
Caves</a> near Munising, Mich., on the Upper Peninsula.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/north-shore-ice-playgrounds/">Enchanted forests, waterfalls and
volcanoes</a></strong></p>
<p>On the shores of the western Great Lakes, waterfalls freeze, wind-borne
spray coats shrubs and branches along the shore and glistening
formations appear along rivers.</p>
<p>Many of the best places to see spectacular ice is on Minnesota's North
Shore and Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore on Michigan's Upper
Peninsula.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/shanties_village.jpg" alt="A village of Art Shanties." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Minneapolis, an Art Shanty village appears on Lake Harriet.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong>Ice castles in southern Wisconsin and the Twin Cities</strong></p>
<p>Just north of the Illinois border in <a href="https://icecastles.com/wisconsin/">Lake
Geneva</a> and in the northern Twin Cities
suburb <a href="https://icecastles.com/minnesota">New Brighton</a>, visit a
professionally built ice castle. Tickets are cheapest when bought
online.</p>
<p>There's also the <a href="https://minnesotaicemaze.com/">Minnesota Ice Maze</a> next to the Vikings headquarters in Eagan, a southern St. Paul suburb. Through Feb. 19, guests also can go next door and try curling, pond hockey and curling during the <a href="https://minnesotaicemaze.com/pages/winter-skolstice">Winter Skolstice</a>.</p>
<h3>Fun festivals and spectator events</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.artshantyprojects.org/">Art Shanties on the ice</a></strong></p>
<p>On frozen Lake Harriet in Minneapolis, artists build two dozen whimsical
Art Shanties, each with a different theme, then invite the public to
visit and partake in games and art activities. It will be weekends from
<em>Jan. 21 to Feb. 12.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.minneapolisparks.org/activities__events/events/lake_harriet_winter_kite_festival/">Lake Harriet Kite
Festival</a>
also will be on the lake <em>Jan. 28.</em></p>
<p>Another fun thing to do in Minneapolis: the goofy <a href="https://artsledrally.com/">Art Sled
Rally</a> in Powderhorn Park <em>Jan. 28.</em></p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/middleton_bockfest_beer.jpg" alt="Capital's Bockfest in February." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Capital Brewing</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bockfest at Capital Brewery is very popular.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/flinging-festivals/">Flinging
festivals</a></strong></p>
<p>Out in the countryside, especially Wisconsin, the cold goes to people's
heads and they start doing strange things, like tossing turkeys,
flinging fruitcakes and pushing decorated porta-potties.</p>
<p>It adds a little levity to a long winter. More conventional <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/winter-festivals-midwest/">winter
festivals</a> are fun, too,
with ice-sculpting contests, hot-air balloon launches and sleigh rides.</p>
<p><strong>Bockfests in  New Ulm  and Middleton</strong></p>
<p>If you're tired of winter, here's where you can usher it out on a Mardi
Gras-style tide of beer. In the Madison suburb of Middleton, at the
<a href="https://www.capitalbrewery.com/events2/26th-annual-bockfest/">Bockfest</a> <em>Feb. 25</em>
at <a href="http://www.capital-brewery.com/home">Capital Brewery</a>, the brewmaster tosses smoked chub off the roof (there's that weird
Wisconsin throwing thing again).</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the German bastion of New Ulm, Minn., <a href="https://www.schellsbrewery.com/">Schell's
Brewery</a> hosts a <a href="https://www.schellsbrewery.com/events/bock-fest/">bock
hunt</a> <em>March 4</em> in the
woods adjoining its hillside brewery.</p>
<p>Both festivals have become so popular they limit tickets, so plan ahead.</p>
<p>And there's a <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/brew-festivals-beer/">craft-beer
festival</a>
nearly every weekend in winter.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/">City weekends</a></h3>
<p>Okay, so you're a sophisticate who doesn't really want to stand around
watching people heave hams. Head for a big city — Chicago, Madison,
Milwaukee, the Twin Cities — for that unbeatable
shopping-eating-nightlife combo.</p>
<p>Hotel rates drop in the winter, and but that's also the best season for
going to the orchestra, ballet, theater or opera.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/e/westby_jumper_stabbur.jpg" alt="A ski jumper in Westby." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A skier flies down the hill in Westby, Wis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Minneapolis, the <a href="http://www.hennepintheatretrust.org/events">Hennepin Theater
District</a> brings in big-name
performers and Broadway musicals. And the big <a href="http://www.loppet.org/cityoflakesloppet/">City of Lakes Loppet Ski
Festival</a>, featuring the very
popular Luminary Loppet, is <em>Feb. 4-5.</em></p>
<h3>Ski jumping tournaments</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to travel to the Olympics, you can watch
world-class ski jumping not far from home.</p>
<p>In Fox River Grove, Ill., the <a href="http://www.norgeskiclub.com/">Norge Ski
Club</a> has a 70-meter hill and holds a tournament <em>Jan. 28-29.</em> This Chicago
suburb has supplied several members of the U.S. Olympic team.</p>
<p>Southeast of La Crosse, the Norwegians of Westby, Wis., celebrates the 100th anniversay of its annual <a href="https://snowflakeskiclub.com/large-hill-ski-jumping-tournament">tournament</a>
<em>Feb. 3-4,</em> on an Olympic-size jump as high as a 41-story skyscraper.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/westby-ski-jumping/">A jumpin'
joint</a>.</p>
<p>In Iron Mountain, Mich., the <a href="http://www.kiwanisskiclub.com/">Kiwanis Ski
Club</a>-sponsored tournament <em>March 3-5</em>
is a Continental Cup event and attracts jumpers from around the world.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porcupines_narnia.jpg" alt="Snowy trail in the Porcupines." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Upper Peninsula, Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park always
has lots of snow.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Best places to find snow</h3>
<p>You can sign up to get the weekly snow reports from
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snow_depth/index.html">Minnesota</a> and
<a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/snowreport/">Wisconsin</a>, but the same
places get the best snow year after year.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/big-snow/">Michigan's Upper Peninsula</a></strong></p>
<p>The most reliable snow for both Nordic and alpine skiers is the Ironwood
area of Michigan's Upper Peninsula.</p>
<p>Indianhead and Blackjack resorts now are one, <a href="https://www.snowriver.com/">Snowriver Mountain Resort</a>. Along with Big Powderhorn and Whitecap, just across the border in Wisconsin, they provide non-stop snow for alpine skiers.</p>
<p>At two cross-country systems —
ABR and Wolverine — nordic skiers are awash in snow through April Fool's Day.</p>
<p>In a bad snow year, you'll still be able to ski here.</p>
<p>And for the best snowshoeing in the region, head for nearby <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-skiing-porcupines-michigan/">Porcupine
Mountains State
Park</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/a/eagle_river_ski_trail__chickadees.jpg" alt="Feeding the chickadees on the Anvil Lake Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Chickadees eat from the hand of a skier on the Anvil Lake Trail near
Eagle River, Wis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/nicolet-forest/">Northeast Wisconsin</a></strong></p>
<p>Nicolet National Forest is vast, remote, barely populated and, in
winter, walloped by snow. Snowmobilers, skiers and snowshoers alike find
plenty of room to do their thing.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/winter-eagle-river/">Eagle River</a> makes a
good base; beginning skiers will like the Anvil Lake Trail east of town,
where chickadees eat out of skiers' hands.</p>
<p>Near Phelps, <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/afterglow-ski-resort-wisconsin/">Afterglow
Resort</a> is a
playground for families, who get towed up a big tubing hill by
snowmobile.</p>
<p>And the area still has some <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/Wisconsin-historic-lodges/">classic old
lodges</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/gunflint-trail-winter/">Minnesota's Gunflint
Trail</a></strong></p>
<p>This pocket of the north woods, along a 57-mile highway that dead-ends
near the Canadian border and adjoins the Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness, has the best snow in Minnesota and 200 kilometers of groomed
trails to go with it.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/cascade_lodge_snowy_cabin.jpg" alt="A cabin at Cascade Lodge in Minnesota." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Cascade Lodge</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A cozy cabin in the woods is the perfect place to practice
Scandinavian-style hygge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>High season is January and February, but the skiing is excellent in
December and March, and rates are lower at the lodges then.</p>
<h3>Learning from the Scandinavians</h3>
<p>Despite the long, dark days in the north, Scandinavians don't dread
winter — they welcome it.</p>
<p>They get to ski, for one thing, but they also light a lot of candles,
sit in front of crackling fires, read books and down warm drinks with
friends.</p>
<p>It's all about a sense of well-being and coziness. In Danish, it's
called
<a href="http://www.mnn.com/family/family-activities/blogs/how-hygge-can-help-you-get-through-winter">hygge</a>. In Norwegian, it's
<a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3052970/how-to-be-a-success-at-everything/the-norwegian-secret-to-enjoying-a-long-winter">koselig</a>.</p>
<p>Try it at home, or get a head start in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Grand
Marais</a>, at the
northeast tip of Minnesota. It's holding a <a href="https://www.visitcookcounty.com/event/hygge-festival/">Hygge
Festival</a> <em>Feb.
4-14,</em>  with Scandinavian menus, a full-moon reading, a cabin concert
