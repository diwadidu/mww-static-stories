<h2>For skiing and snowshoeing, four state parks along I-35 are as up north as you need to be.</h2>

<p>For some people, Interstate 35 may as well be a pneumatic tube linking
the Twin Cities to Duluth and the North Shore.</p>
<p>But those willing to stop and get off the beaten track are rewarded.</p>
<p>In four state parks, skiers, snowshoers and snowmobilers glide along
miles of trails on the St. Croix, Kettle and St. Louis rivers, once
plied by lumberjacks and quarrymen.</p>
<p>One park is known for its trumpeter swans and one for its ruins and ice
falls. Another has a suspension bridge and a Cubist landscape of tilted
rock.</p>
<p>Three of the parks are along one 50-mile stretch and can be sampled on a
day trip. But that would be a shame, because the parks also are home to
some of the most coveted guesthouses and camper cabins in Minnesota.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>One February, friends and I headed up to St. Croix State Park, which has
two large and modern guesthouses. But first, we stopped at Wild River
State Park, 10 miles east of North Branch and its outlet mall.</p>
<p>This riverside park has a full-time naturalist and stays busy
year-round, with many visitors staying in its six camper cabins or cozy
guesthouse with wood-burning fireplace.</p>
<p>In winter, Wild River is popular with cross-country skiers, who can
glide across prairie and meadows, into woods and along the St. Croix
River to the site of the Nevers Dam, built after the infamous Taylors
Falls log jam of 1886.</p>
<p>It's long gone, but there's an overlook with interpretive plaques about
the logging era and a stairway leading to the water, where half a dozen
trumpeter swans often can be seen fishing off a sandbar.</p>
<p>After skiing part of the 30-mile trail system, we got back onto I-35 and
drove up to Hinckley, then east to the river and Minnesota's largest
state park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/banning_icefall_torsten_christy.jpg" alt="Frozen Wolf Creek Falls in Banning." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Banning State Park, Wolf Creek Falls freezes.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At St. Croix State Park, the St. Croix River enters Minnesota , and the
Kettle River soon flows into it.  The park has two large, two-story
guesthouses, and after we settled into one of them and fixed ourselves
dinner, we drove over to the log lodge built in the 1930s by the
Civilian Conservation Corps.</p>
<p>It was the night of the annual candlelight ski, and we made two loops of
the luminary-lit course-as always, magical under the crisp black
night sky. Then we went into the lodge, where fires were crackling in
two hearths and park staff were handing out cookies and hot chocolate in
ceramic mugs.</p>
<p>In the morning, we put on snowshoes and bushwhacked down to the river, a
flat white highway through the woods. Returning along a ski trail, we
were a stone's throw from the guesthouse when we heard a tree branch
creak overhead and looked up.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151489033780129&amp;set=a.114471060128.120661.104777055128&amp;type=1&amp;theater">boreal
owl</a>
was sitting there, looking at us quizzically. It was so close we could
see its cream-and-caramel breast feathers rustling in the breeze, and we
stood there for at least 10 minutes, watching it.</p>
<p>We didn't know how rare a boreal-owl sighting was, or that this owl
would be the farthest south reported that year, part of an irruption out
of Canada. When we found out, we felt even luckier.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From St. Croix Park, we headed north again, this time just 10 minutes
along I-35 from Hinckley to Sandstone.</p>
<p>Banning is one of the easiest parks to reach but also one of the most
overlooked.</p>
<p>Whitewater paddlers revere it for the rip-roaring rapids of the Kettle
River, and hikers for the unusual scenery, which include the ruins of a
stone-quarrying business and craggy sandstone outcroppings that loom
over trails.</p>
<p>Skiing these trails is fun, but we decided to snowshoe down to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151491208915129&amp;set=a.10150776213125129.462107.104777055128&amp;type=1&amp;theater">Wolf
Creek
Falls</a>, where water tumbles over a long rock shelf and into a round pond. In
winter, it forms an ice curtain, and we tromped behind it and above it,
oohing and aahing.</p>
<p>It's another 50 miles to Jay Cooke State Park. Here, the St. Louis
River leaves the Lake Superior basin, rising through house-sized
builders and sharp ledges that make the river unnavigable for anybody
except kayakers willing to flirt with death.</p>

<p>We stayed there on another trip, arriving when new snow had coated every
branch and flocked every bough. We had the sole camper cabin, building a
campfire with provided wood and listening to the lonely whistle of a
train. Since then, the state has built another four cabins.</p>
<p>In the morning, we  crossed the river on the suspension bridge, then
hiked along the Carlton Trail, under canopies of aspen and up hills
where birch popped out against blue sky.</p>
<p>Jay Cooke offers naturalist programs year-round, and in winter, all of
these parks have snowshoe hikes and candlelight skis. And when you go,
check in at the office-park staff just may have an owl or porcupine
sighting to tell you about.</p>
