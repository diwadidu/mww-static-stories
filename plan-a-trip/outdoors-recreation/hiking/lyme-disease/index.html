<h2>The bite of a deer tick can cause major headaches, and more.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/deer_tick.jpg" alt="A deer tick." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In late April, a hiker picked up a deer tick near Cable, Wis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the woods, the first ticks appear as soon as snow starts to melt, and
they're out en masse when warmer weather arrives in April and May.</p>
<p>Regular ticks are bad enough, scuttling into hidden niches on the human
body and gorging themselves on blood. But their ick factor pales next to
the danger posed by black-legged ticks, which can transmit Lyme and
other diseases.</p>
<p>Black-legged ticks, also known as deer ticks, need to be attached to the
skin for 24 to 36 hours to transmit the disease. Even then, it's usually
treated easily if caught promptly.</p>
<p>But if untreated, symptoms include fatigue, fever and achiness;
eventually, it can lead to nerve damage, chronic joint pain and even
neurological problems.</p>
<p>Wisconsin is the epicenter of Lyme disease in the Upper Midwest, with
1,121 confirmed cases and 748 probable cases in 2018, according to the
<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html">Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>However, the number of cases is declining in Wisconsin as well as
Minnesota, which had 950 confirmed and 591 probable cases in 2018.</p>
<p>Field studies in Minnesota have shown that about one-third of adult
ticks and one in five young ticks, called nymphs, carry the bacteria
that causes Lyme disease.</p>
<p>The incidence of the disease is even higher in New England, with 83
cases per 100,000 people in Maine, as opposed to 19.3 cases per 100,000
in Wisconsin and 16.9 in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Here are the best ways to prevent infection.</p>
<p><em>Tck in shirts and pants</em> . To make ticks easier to see, <em>wear
light-colored clothing</em> . Nymphs may look like a moving freckle.</p>
<p><em>Spray skin and clothing with bug spray</em> containing 30 percent DEET, or
<em>spray clothing with Permethrin</em> clothing repellent. Some outdoors
people even <em>soak</em> pants in it. An aerosol can that will spray three
sets of clothing costs $10-$15. They're available at outdoors stores.</p>
<p><em>Run hands over skin</em> to detect the smaller ticks, then again <em>in the
shower</em> .</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/i/tick_sign.jpg" alt="A sign warns of ticks." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Dogs often carry ticks into the house and need to be checked. For them,
a Lyme disease vaccine is available.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you find one, grasp its head gently, with tweezers or your fingers,
and <em>pull it out slowly</em> . Then, disinfect the bite site.</p>
<p>People who have to remove a lot of ticks from themselves or their dogs
swear by the <a href="https://tickkey.com/">Tick Key</a> and <a href="https://www.ticktwister.com/">Tick
Twister</a> remover tools.</p>
<p>Ticks also can hide in the folds of clothing or boots and crawl onto the
body later. <em>Putting clothing in a dryer</em> on high heat for at least
10 minutes will kill them.</p>
<p>And here's an ingenious idea: <em>Wrap a strip of duct tape, sticky side
out, around your cuffs</em> to keep ticks from crawling up your legs and
arms, especially if you will be <em>walking in brush or long grass</em> .</p>
<p>If you want to be especially safe, wrap the tape around your collar,
too, to keep them out of your hair-although ticks don't drop out of
trees; they get to your head by crawling.</p>
<p>If you spend a lot of time in tick country, and you think you still
might get bitten, some doctors recommend you get <em>an advance
prescription</em> for a one-time, 200 milligram dose of the antibiotic
doxycycline. You still need to go to the doctor, but at least you can
get a head start on treatment.</p>
<p>Depending on location, says Dr. Russell Johnson, a microbiologist who
studies agents of Lyme disease at the University of Minnesota, 40 to 60
percent of adult female black-legged ticks carry Lyme disease.</p>
<p>The first ticks out mostly are adults; the nymphs that appear from
mid-May to early July carry the disease at about half that rate, but all
are looking for blood meals and are harder to see.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Deer-tick nymphs appear as black dots, the size of a poppy seed; adults
are the size of a sesame seed.</p>
<p>About 80 percent of people will develop an even red rash that may look
like a bull's-eye rash, Johnson said.</p>
<p>But even if you don't, and you develop an unexplained fever or ache
about two weeks after spending time in woods, consider the possibility
of Lyme disease.</p>
<p>You may need to be a <em>firm advocate for yourself</em> ; some doctors are not
well-informed about tick-borne diseases. The tests for Lyme look for
antibodies, which the body doesn't develop immediately, so <em>early tests
often result in a false negative</em> .</p>
<p>Robert Sitko of Stillwater, Minn., a beekeeper who tends apiaries in the
heavily infested St. Croix River Valley and likes to go camping, knew he
was at risk. One year, he saw the tell-tale bull's-eye rash of Lyme
disease on his body and went to a doctor, who prescribed three weeks of
antibiotics.</p>
<p>That was that-until a year later, when he ran a 105-degree fever and
landed in the hospital. That time, it was anaplasmosis, also known as
ehrlichiosis, another bacterium transmitted by deer ticks.</p>
<p>Now, Sitko does everything he can to avoid being bitten by a deer tick.
He tucks his pants legs into his socks. He checks skin and clothes
religiously. He uses insect repellents .</p>

and two nymphs. On the right, a common dog tick.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>He might have taken the vaccine if it hadn't been discontinued for human
use, but he gets a shot of it for his German shorthair dog every year.</p>
<p>And after he found a deer tick while cutting trees in his back yard, he
drove to a sporting-goods store and bought a canister of Permethrin
clothing repellent.</p>
<p>&quot;What you do is spray it on your clothes, let it dry two hours, and it's
supposed to last six weeks or six washings,&quot; he said. &quot;Supposedly, it
kills ticks on contact. I thought, that's the perfect thing for people
going on a week's camping trip.&quot;</p>
<p>Microbiologist Johnson confirms that the product does work.</p>
<p>&quot;It works very well,&quot; he says. &quot;In fact, it kills ticks within seconds
of contact.&quot;</p>
<p>Western Wisconsin and the St. Croix Valley of Minnesota are considered
hot spots for Lyme-carrying deer ticks, but they've expanded their range
northward and westward to northern Minnesota, Johnson said.</p>
<p>In Iowa, 91 cases were confirmed in 2018, with 192 probable cases.
Illinois recorded 189 confirmed and 87 probable cases, and Michigan 184
confirmed and 78 probable cases.</p>
