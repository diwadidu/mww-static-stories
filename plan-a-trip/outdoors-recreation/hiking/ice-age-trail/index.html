<h2>In north-central Wisconsin, a slow-moving monolith left a playground for weekend wanderers.</h2>

<p>When the last glacier melted out of Wisconsin, it left a gift to future
generations.</p>
<p>It wasn't much at first-boulders, heaps of gravel, water, chunks of
ice trapped under rubble.</p>
<p>But over time, the ice seeped away and created kettle lakes for
fishermen. The raging meltwater stripped away softer rock, leaving walls
of volcanic rock for climbers and scenic river gorges for canoeists.</p>
<p>The heaps of gravel grew skins of greenery and, with boulders carried
down from Canada, created a dramatic landscape.</p>
<p>For hikers, they show the glacier's path as surely as cairns. The line
along which the glacier retreated, tossing off rubble in fits and
starts, now is the 1,100-mile Ice Age National Scenic Trail, one of nine
nationwide.</p>
<p>From the Dalles of St. Croix, it winds through the eskers of Chequamegon
National Forest and loops down to the Wisconsin Dells, east through the
Kettle Moraine and up to Door County.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Its segments include a virtual Greatest Hits of hiking trails: the
Pothole Trail in Interstate State Park, the Blue Hills near Rice Lake,
the East Bluff Trail in Devil's Lake State Park.</p>
<p>(For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/best-hikes-ice-age-trail/">Greatest hits of the Ice
Age</a>.)</p>
<p>If it's scenic, it's probably glacial: Though the last glacier covered
two-thirds of North America, it's called the Wisconsin Glacier because
Wisconsin is where it left the most evidence of its passage.</p>
<p>You can get in a solid weekend's worth of hiking in almost any part of
the state. But one of the areas with the most continuous miles of trails
is in the middle of the state, where the Ice Age Trail hits its
northernmost points.</p>
<h3>Hiking around Timm's Hill</h3>
<p>One October, I hiked four of those segments, one in the Chippewa
Moraine, near Bloomer, and three in Taylor County, through Chequamegon
National Forest.</p>
<p>This section of the state is unsung-no large towns, no big tourist
attractions. What it does have are quiet forests and lots of trails,
lovingly maintained by the locals.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/c/ice_age_trail.jpg" alt="Map of the Ice Age Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This makes it a great place to be in fall, when piles of leaves swish
under the feet of hikers and winding country lanes provide scenic routes
for leaf peepers.</p>
<p>My base was at the foot of Timm's Hill, the highest point in Wisconsin
and gateway to a forest full of trails. The 10-mile Timm's Hill
National Trail starts there, a stone's throw from High Point Village
resort; I hiked it once, and it's was a beauty.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/timms-hill/">Trek to Timm's Hill</a>.</p>
<p>This time, I took my husband and teens to the trail's southern
trailhead, where we picked up the Rib Lake segment of the Ice Age Trail.
The area also has many nordic-skiing loops, and junctions looked like
those in the Black Forest, marked with red, yellow, green and blue
blazes.</p>
<p>Here, the trail pays tribute to the German Volksmarsch (people's walks)
tradition; we passed the Brandenburger Tor and Stille Nacht campground
on our way to the Ansiedlerdenkmalwald, or settlers' memorial forest.</p>
<p>So it gave us a start then we came to Old Tote Road, <em>Tote</em>
being the German word for dead people.
The road was used to supply logging camps, and the ruins of Camp 6 were
along our path, as well as the site of a tannery that used the local
hemlocks, extracting tannic acid from their bark.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's a grove of baby hemlocks along the trail now, and we walked
through stands of oak, maple and Norway pine, mixed with aspen and
birch. A thick layer of leaves covered the rolling trail, and here and
there a buttercup pushed through.</p>
<p>Wisconsin's <a href="https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/travel/road/rustic-roads/rr1.aspx">Rustic Road
1</a> is
just north of the trailhead, so after our hike we went on a gorgeous
fall drive, winding around South Harper Lake, through Rib Lake and onto
rolling Wisconsin 102.</p>
<p>That skirts Spirit Lake under a canopy of trees and leads to County Road
C and Rustic Road 62, which returned us to High Point Village.</p>
<p>Then we left the kids in the cabin with a movie and headed for the
eastern Wood Lake segment of the Ice Age Trail, deep in the forest.</p>
<p>We were enchanted by four tiers of gold-an ankle-deep layer of
leaves, shoulder-high oak and maple saplings, a maple understory and
towering oaks still holding onto a moptop of russet leaves.</p>
<p>Ferns were still June-green, and backlit maple leaves glowed purple.
Gigantic erratics-glacier-borne boulders-popped up here and
there, out of place among the trees.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>On to Mondeaux Flowage</h3>
<p>In the morning, we climbed the tower on Timm's Hill, for a view from
the top of Wisconsin. Then we headed west to the sinuous Mondeaux
Flowage, where a huge esker formed from sand and gravel deposited by a
river flowing beneath the glacier.</p>
<p>After remote Wood Lake, the Mondeaux recreation area, which has four
campgrounds, a swimming beach and boat rentals, seemed cheerful and
civilized.</p>
<p>We bought twist cones at the pretty log Mondeaux Dam Lodge and walked
high above a picturesque backwater on the 1.2-mile Aldo Leopold
Commemorative Trail, lined with quotes from the Wisconsin
environmentalist.</p>
<p>From a stand of red pine on the western shore of the lake, we followed
the Ice Age Trail atop the esker, down to the West Point campground. It
was a sunny Sunday, and families of hikers were out in force.</p>
<p>From Taylor County we drove straight west on County Road D through a
lumpy landscape of glacial till, its grass toupee barely enough for a
grazing cow.</p>
<p>At a bend in the Chippewa River, we turned south on Rustic Road 6, part
of the Old Flambeau Trail, then west on County Road M through the
Chippewa Moraine Ice Age National Scientific Reserve.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>A center for the Ice Age</h3>
<p>An interpretive center sits high on a pile of silted clay, once the
bottom of a glacial lake.</p>
<p>It had just closed, but we stood looking over the treetops to the south,
reading plaques that explained how a 600-foot-high sheet of melting ice
had moved just to the horizon, where a massive chunk broke off and was
buried by debris from the moving ice behind it.</p>
<p>When the buried ice melted, much later, it created the Chippewa Moraine.</p>
<p>The woods behind the center were still full of hikers, enjoying the last
rays of sunlight. We headed onto the wide Woolly Mammoth Nature Trail,
in a bowl sprinkled with kettle lakes, their still waters reflecting the
crowns of oaks.</p>
<p>The Ice Age Trail balloons into a 4Â½-mile loop around the center, then
extends a mile farther west. It picks up again in the Blue Hills, then
skips over to Haugen, seven miles north of Rice Lake.</p>
<p>From there, the trail stretches 88 miles to the Ice Age Interpretive
Center in Interstate State Park, the longest developed stretch so far.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_auburn_center_view.jpg" alt="A kettle lake at the Chippewa Moraine center." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Chippewa Moraine Interpretive Center near New Auburn overlooks a
kettle lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>More than 620 miles of the trail are now complete, though 130 miles of
those are on private land and 120 on county land.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the trail has many friends. The state's congressional
delegation has secured millions for land acquisition, and volunteer
members of 24 Ice Age chapters maintain the trail.</p>
<p>One day, says Christine Thisted of the Ice Age Trail Alliance,Â  the
trail will be like the Appalachian Trail, only better.</p>
<p>&quot;It's close to where people live, it's in people's back yards,&quot; she
says. &quot;You don't have to drive 1,000 miles to access it. It's
beautiful, and it's culturally significant-the land grew up and
developed around its features.&quot;</p>
<p>And in Wisconsin, glaciers are considered cool.</p>
<p>&quot;When I took this job, I thought, glacial features, who's going to
know what that is?&quot; Thisted said. &quot;But people knew what they had, and
they take great pride in it.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Ice Age Trail in Taylor County</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_croix_falls_trail.jpg" alt="The Ice Age Trail near St. Croix Falls." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A section of the Ice Age Trail near St. Croix Falls.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> Timm's Hill is six miles east of Ogema,Â  which is 20
miles north of Medford.</p>
<p><em>When to go:</em> Usually, there's nice fall color through the third week
of October. In the winter, there's excellent cross-country skiing.
Glacial features are easiest to see in spring, before leaves come out.</p>
<p><em>Hiking tip:</em> If you want to cover as much trail as possible, without
having to repeat your tracks, plan a trip with friends.</p>
<p>Drop one group at one end of the trail, and then head for the other.
Give your friends the car keys when you meet them on the trail and have
them pick you up when they're finished.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations:</em> <a href="http://www.highpointvillage.com/">High Point Village</a>, across Bass Lake from Timm's Hill, rents four very attractive chalet
cabins with loft, VCR and full kitchen.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Ice Age National Scenic Trail in Wisconsin</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> The western trailhead is in Interstate State Park, an
hour west of the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>The trail is about 1,200, but only 675 miles of trail are completed,
connected mostly by country roads.</p>
<p>For more about Interstate State Park and St. Croix Falls, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/stcroix-falls/">Trail mix
