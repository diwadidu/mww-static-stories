<h2>You can backpack, day hike, stay in lodges or go with a group on Minnesota's premier path.</h2>

<p>To a novice, Minnesota's Superior Hiking Trail presents a bewilderment
of possibilities.</p>
<p>There are 310 miles of trail between Jay Cooke State Park near Duluth
and the Canadian border. Some are in the city, some deep in forest. Many
stretches include spectacular views of Lake Superior, but others (gasp!)
are a little boring.</p>
<p>People come from all over the nation to hike this beloved trail, and
some take three or four weeks and do the whole thing. But there are many
ways to hike the trail.</p>
<p>You can fit in a couple of the most popular day hikes on a trip to the
North Shore, or you can spend a weekend backpacking. You can walk a
loop, pay for a shuttle or shuttle yourself by car or bicycle.</p>
<p>You can spend as much as you want, too — from $349 per day to stay in
a lodge on a guided trip to $35 per day to backpack with a non-profit
outdoors club.</p>
<p>Here's how to plan your trip on the Superior Hiking Trail.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Gathering information</h3>
<p>First, buy a copy of the <a href="https://shop.superiorhiking.org/">Trail Atlas</a>, $24.99. If you're planning more than a few day hikes, spend $35 to
join the <a href="http://www.shta.org">Superior Hiking Trail Association</a>,
whose volunteers maintain the trail.</p>
<p>If you're planning to backpack, join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/suphike">Superior Hiking Trail
Facebook group</a>, whose members
post invaluable advice about gear, campsites, mileage and itineraries.
They're also gracious about answering questions.</p>
<p>For day hikes on and around the trail, get tips from Andrew Slade's
guidebook <a href="http://www.thereandbackbooks.com/hiking-the-north-shore.php">&quot;Hiking the North
Shore,&quot;</a>
which lists 50 in the region and includes handy maps.</p>
<h3>What to know</h3>
<p>Allow an hour for each 1½ miles, or 1 mile with a backpack. Even day
hikers should bring water and snacks, wear sturdy shoes and be prepared
for sudden weather changes.</p>

<p>Be sure to treat your skin and/or clothes for ticks, especially in
spring and summer. Disease-carrying deer ticks are not uncommon along
the North Shore. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/lyme-disease/">How to prevent Lyme
disease</a>.</p>
<p>Before heading out, check the
<a href="http://shta.org/trail-conditions/">Conditions</a> page of the Superior
Hiking Trail website. In spring, bridges may be out and the trail very
muddy. In late summer, water may be low in streams.</p>
<p>In fall, hunters are out, and when the deer firearm season starts in
November, the Lake County part of the trail closes. In winter,
trailheads may not be plowed.</p>
<p>Use extreme care around the rivers. Furious currents can drown swimmers,
especially in the Temperance River.</p>
<p>Bears rarely are seen on the trail, but most hikers put their food in
canisters or trees, which also helps protect it from rodents.</p>
<p>For help finding your way to trailheads and landmarks, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-minnesota/trip-planning-north-shore-minnesota/">North Shore
by the
mile</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Choosing a hike</h3>
<p>Spur hikes start right off Minnesota 61, many in the state parks —
especially Gooseberry Falls, Tettegouche, Temperance River and Cascade
River.</p>
<p>There aren't many loops, but the five-mile loop up and down the Split
Rock River, four miles east of Gooseberry Falls State Park, is very
popular.</p>
<p>The trail association describes <a href="http://www.shta.org/Trail/TrailMaps/index.php">trail
sections</a>. For a short
backpacking trip, it recommends the 11-mile stretch between Silver Bay
and Minnesota 1, on the east side of Tettegouche State Park, for its
scenery, campsites and fairly reliable water.</p>
<p>For a longer backpacking trip, try the 24-mile segment between Grand
Marais and C.R. Magney State Park via the dramatic Devil's Track and
Kadunce river gorges. It includes the vista from Pincushion Mountain as
well as the only segment directly on the Lake Superior shoreline, which
is difficult.</p>
<p>For a list of popular day hikes, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">Hiking the North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>Duluth has many lovely stretches of trail, and it's easy to shuttle
yourself there, by city bus, bicycle or taxi. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/superior-hiking-trail-duluth/">Hiking in
Duluth</a>.</p>

<h3>Four ways to hike the trail</h3>
<p>You can rough it or hike in luxury. All of the trips below include
lodgings, meals and transportation as noted. Cost is per person and, for
lodge trips, based on double occupancy. For camping trips, meals (mostly
groceries) are estimated at $20 per day.</p>
<p><em>$347.50 per night</em> — Guided <a href="https://www.wildernessinquiry.org/destination/superior-hiking-trail-lodge-hike/">weekend lodge-to-lodge

Inquiry</a> of Minneapolis, not including
transportation to Grand Marais. Some are for women, and all are open to
people with disabilities.</p>
<p><em>$150-$175 per night</em> — Self-guided weekend lodge-to-lodge trip
arranged by Barbara and Ted Young's <a href="http://www.boundarycountry.com/">Boundary Country
Trekking</a>. Package includes shuttle,
breakfast, trail lunch and an annual membership in the Superior Hiking
Trail Association</p>
<p>The total includes $30 for dinner in a restaurant and may be higher,
depending on the route and the season; peak summer and fall trips cost
more.</p>

<p><em>$50+ per day</em> — Self-guided, self-arranged weekend camping trip with
return from <a href="http://www.superiorshuttle.com">Superior Shuttle</a>. Add the

<p><em>$35 per day</em> — Weekend camping trip coordinated by members of the

Cities. Add $25 for an annual membership ($10 for students and

<p>For club trips, members can borrow backpacks, tents, sleeping bags,
stoves and other camping gear.</p>
<p>Transportation from the Twin Cities is by carpooling; those who don't
drive contribute to expenses.</p>
