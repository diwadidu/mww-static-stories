<p>In the pandemic year of 2020, everyone wants to spend time outside.</p>
<p>Which is great, unless you're inexperienced and in a remote or
unfamiliar place.</p>
<p>In the northwestern corner of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Porcupine
Mountains Wilderness State Park was packed with visitors all summer, and
many weren't prepared — in the 10 weeks before Labor Day, rangers had
to answer 30 search-and-rescue calls, as compared to only six in all of
2019.</p>
<p>Some people underestimated the length and difficulty of trails. Others
committed the typical rookie mistakes of overloading backpacks and
wearing brand-new boots.</p>
<p>In this region, we don't have mountains to fall off or deserts where we
might run out of water. We think we know our surroundings, so we fail to
take even the most basic steps to protect ourselves.</p>
<p>Even those of us who — ahem! — think we're experienced and are
lulled by our relatively benign surroundings.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Once, my husband and I nearly got caught on a remote stretch of
Wisconsin's Ice Age National Scenic Trail. It was mid-October, and late
in the day when we reached what we thought was the halfway point on a
five-mile hike.</p>
<p>But either the map was wrong or we'd misread it, because soon, we
realized we were running out of daylight. In the dark, we'd be lost —
the trail was covered by a thick layer of fallen leaves and marked only
by yellow blazes on trees.</p>
<p>We ended up running the last few miles, arriving at our car with only
five minutes of daylight to spare.</p>
<p>I don't think we would have died, but we would have spent a very
miserable night in the woods.</p>
<p>We'd made nearly every mistake in the book: No one knew where we were.
We hadn't brought a headlamp or any other light.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/i/timms_hill_trail_arrows.jpg" alt="Hiking on the Ice Age Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Signs help hikers on Wisconsin's Ice Age National Scenic Trail &mdash; but
don't rely on them.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We had no food or water. We didn't have warm clothes. We had no
emergency blanket, lighter, knife or compass. We were complete idiots.</p>
<p>At a minimum, hikers should carry water, snacks and a map, and they
should always tell someone where they're going and when they expect to
be back. If there's a register at the trailhead, sign it.</p>
<p>It's also smart to carry a compass and a small LED light, among the
National Park Service's list of <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/10essentials.htm">10
essentials</a> to bring on a
hike.</p>
<p>Then, fill a fanny pack with a lightweight survival kit, as suggested by
Backpacker magazine: an emergency blanket, two fire starters (a cheap
butane lighter is best), signaling device (a whistle, if nothing else),
knife or razor blade and a square of heavy-duty aluminum foil for making
a cup or cookpot.</p>
<p>It also suggests <a href="http://www.backpacker.com/view/videos/skills-videos/how-to-make-a-cheese-wax-candle/">making a
candle</a>
out of the red wax around Babybel cheese (a great snack to stick into
your fanny pack).</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>You could also carry a small tablet with <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/wilderness-first-aid-basics.html">wilderness first aid
tips</a>
and other information.</p>
<p>If you do get lost, says the magazine, sit down, drink some water and
think things through. Then note your location and surrounding landmarks
carefully, and retrace your steps to the last point where you knew you
were on route.</p>
<p>Don't follow the closest creek downstream until it meets a river,
thinking rivers always lead to civilization — that's a myth, according
to Backpacker.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try to find shelter, stay warm and dry and wait
for rescue.</p>
<p>Above all, don't let yourself get wet, because moisture conducts cold
rapidly. The best clothing item? It's not warm gloves, thick socks, a
warm hat or a thick parka, but a waterproof and breathable rain suit.</p>

<p>In news accounts, you'll often read of paddlers and hikers who died of
&quot;exposure.&quot; That's hypothermia, in which the body temperature drops,
affecting the ability to move, think and act rationally.</p>
<p>It's the fourth most-common cause of death in the wilderness, according
to Backpacker. (Falling is the No. 1 cause, followed by drowning and
heart attack.)</p>
<p>Frigid Lake Superior can cause hypothermia in half an hour. Hypothermia
is a risk even in temperatures above 55 degrees, especially if it's
windy and raining and if the victim is tired and thirsty.</p>
<p>How do you prevent it? Easy — by carrying water and food, wearing
appropriate clothing (on large bodies of water, a wetsuit) and not
getting lost or separated from friends.</p>
<p>Think you already know what you need to survive? Rate your survival IQ
with the magazine's <a href="https://www.backpacker.com/trips/quiz-would-you-survive">36-question survival
quiz</a> ; you may
be surprised.</p>
<p>And if you're a novice hiker, go on a guided hike. If you're a novice
paddler, go on a guided excursion. Large bodies of water, especially
mercurial Lake Superior, can be very dangerous for paddlers, even
experienced ones.</p>
