<h2>In Wisconsin, the best walking trails are gifts from the glaciers.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_lake_rocks2.jpg" alt="Rocks in Devil's Lake State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the East Bluff Trail, hikers walk past the Devil's Doorway and
Balanced Rock.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>If you've ever walked in Wisconsin, chances are you've walked on the
edge of a glacier.</p>
<p>The ice is gone, but not the rubble it pushed across the landscape, or
the rock its melting waters carved. As the last glacier retreated, it
left a path that geologists can follow as easily as yellow lines on a
highway.</p>
<p>That path now is the 1,100-mile Ice Age National Scenic Trail, with 620
miles marked, usually by yellow rectangles tacked to trees. It's easy to
follow in the forest, but many of the most spectacular spots are right
along highways.</p>
<p>One fall, I kept running into the trail wherever I went. In late
September, we got off Wisconsin 29 to explore the marble-like Dells of
the Eau Claire near Wausau.</p>
<p>On the way home, we took in the view from Rib Mountain, which was known
as Wisconsin's highest point until Timm's Hill, also a stop on the Ice
Age Trail, took the title.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In early October, I hiked along the Dalles of the St. Croix River, where
swirling rubble drilled the world's largest potholes.</p>
<p>In mid-October, we spent half an hour photographing a lovely marsh where
the trail crosses the Wisconsin River between Merrill and Tomahawk, and
we followed the trail home along U.S. 8, stopping to hike in the Blue
Hills.</p>
<p>You can't help loving this trail. It's best hiked in spring, before
trees leaf out, and in autumn, when fallen leaves open up the forest and
all of the odd features can be seen-lone boulders called erratics and
the conical hills, high ridges and long hillocks known as kames, eskers
and drumlins.</p>
<p>Here are 10 of the best places to see what the glaciers left.</p>
<p>The trail, proposed and first mapped in 1958 by Milwaukee hiker Ray
Zillmer, still is being developed and is maintained by 2,280 volunteers
in 24 chapters. &quot;We spend millions to go fast; let's spend a little to
go slow,&quot; Zillmer said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_croix_falls_ice_age.jpg" alt="Walking the Ice Age trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A hiker walks the Ice Age Trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>His trail traces the retreat of the last glacier, which lay across half
the continent but is called the Wisconsin Glacier because that's where
it left the most dramatic terrain.</p>
<p>Moving in fits and starts, it tossed off truck-size boulders and
deposited gravel and sand that turned the land into a lumpy quilt.</p>
<p>At the Dalles of St. Croix and Wisconsin Dells, it created craggy
gorges. Across the north woods, giant chunks of dropped ice left
depressions that filled with water and became kettle lakes.</p>
<p>From St. Croix Falls, the trail heads west through the Blue Hills and
Chequamegon National Forest.</p>
<p>Then it heads south with the Wisconsin River, passing through the
Baraboo Hills and forming a big U as it heads northward through Kettle
Moraine State Forest to Door County.</p>
<p>The most spectacular and varied hiking is around Devil's Lake State
Park, just south of the Wisconsin Dells.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The best forest hiking and longest developed stretch is around Timm's
Hill and in Taylor County, north of Medford in north-central Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The best short hikes are in the Dalles of the St Croix, where there's an
Interstate State Park both in Wisconsin and Minnesota.</p>
<p>The spots below are listed from west to east.</p>
<p>The best maps are in the Ice Age Trail Atlas, $35, and Companion Guide,
$20. You can also use the map on the <a href="http://www.iceagetrail.org/trail-map-and-current-conditions">Ice Age Trail
Alliance</a>
site (just keep clicking to zoom in).</p>
<h3>Interstate State Park, St. Croix Falls</h3>
<p>The clifftop Pothole Trail in this park along the St. Croix River is the
best place to watch the abundant action: climbers on the basalt cliff
face, sightseers across the river on Angle Rock, where the river takes a
hard right; and paddlewheelers, which have been taking tourists to see
the formations since 1904.</p>
<p>There's the craggy Old Man of the Dalles, the Elephant's Head, the Turk
with a turban and the Holy Cross, for which French fur-traders named the
river.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_croix_falls_interstate_trail.jpg" alt="A trail in Wisconsin's Interstate Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Interstate State Park, the Pothole Trail illustrates the power of
fast-moving glacial water.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's lined by cylindrical potholes, drilled into solid rock by
whirlpools laced with gravel. They're even bigger across the river in
Minnesota's Interstate State Park.</p>
<p>Standing at the bottom of the 35-foot-deep Bake Oven, touching walls as
smooth as vinyl, it's easy to imagine the scene 12,000 years ago, when
sheets of water from the melting Wisconsin Glacier roared past ,
creating what now is the St. Croix River Valley.</p>
<p>Named Dalles of the St. Croix — dalle is French for rocky slab —
this gorge is a first cousin of the Wisconsin Dells, which were created
in a week by a nearly apocalyptic rush of glacial meltwater.</p>
<p>Minnesota hikers can avoid Wisconsin's $10 out-of-state parking fee
simply by walking across the U.S. 8 bridge from Taylors Falls; the trail
starts on the opposite end.</p>

Croix</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/chipmoraine/naturecenter">Chippewa Moraine Interpretive Center</a>, New Auburn</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/new_auburn_center_view.jpg" alt="A kettle lake at the Chippewa Moraine center." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Chippewa Moraine Interpretive Center near New Auburn overlooks a
kettle lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Ten miles east of U.S. 53, just northeast of Bloomer, this interpretive
center sits high on a pile of silted clay, once the bottom of a glacial
lake.</p>
<p>In this area, a 600-foot-high sheet of melting ice dropped massive
chunks of ice that were buried by debris and eventually melted, creating
the lumpy moraine and hundreds of kettle lakes.</p>
<p>From the center, the wide Woolly Mammoth Nature Trail winds through a
bowl sprinkled with kettle lakes. The Ice Age Trail balloons into a
4½-mile loop around the center, then extends west to <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/brunetisland/">Brunet Island
State Park</a> on the
Chippewa River.</p>
<p>On the first Saturday of October, the local Ice Age volunteer chapter
holds a Parade of Colors Fall Hike from the center, providing a shuttle
and refreshments at the hike's end. Hikers pass 21 lakes on the six-mile
trek.</p>
<h3>Timm's Hill near Ogema</h3>
<p>This modest hill, six miles east of Ogema off Wisconsin 86, is the
highest point in Wisconsin at 1,951½ feet.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/i/timms_hill_view.jpg" alt="View of Timm's Hill from High Point Village." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Timm's Hill edges out Rib Mountain as Wisconsin's high point.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's the region's easiest high point to visit; just drive up to Timm's
Hill County Park and walk a short distance. For a view, you have to
climb an observation tower.</p>
<p>However, it's also the northern trailhead of 10-mile Timm's Hill
National Trail, which heads south to the beautiful Rib Lake section of
the Ice Age Trail.</p>
<p>The area also is a great place for driving, with Wisconsin's Rustic
Road 62 passing by its feet and Rustic Road 1 just to the south.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/timms-hill/">Trek to Timm's Hill</a>.</p>
<h3>Mondeaux Flowage near Medford</h3>
<p>One of the Ice Age Trail's best eskers is 10 miles west of Wisconsin 13,
north of Medford. (One of the others is right in St. Croix Falls, called
the Wellness Esker because there's a hospital on it.)</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At the edges of the glacier, streams that flowed through tunnels of ice
deposited piles of sand and gravel, creating long, rounded ridges called
eskers. On the shores of the Mondeaux Flowage, hikers walk on top of an
esker.</p>
<p>It's fairly remote, in the middle of Chequamegon State Forest, but it's
popular with familes. The Mondeaux Recreation Area has four U.S. Forest
Service campgrounds with showers, a swimming beach, boat rentals and a
store.</p>
<p>The log Mondeaux Dam Lodge has a café and sells ice cream and snacks.</p>

Age Trail</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=109">Dells of the Eau Claire River</a> near Wausau</h3>
<p>In this extremely picturesque stretch of the Eau Claire River, bedrock
tilted and fractured. The rock is not basalt but rhyolite, another
metamorphic rock that is so smooth it looks like oiled bronze.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wausau_dells_eau_claire.jpg" alt="Dells of the Eau Claire County Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Dells of the Eau Claire features rhyolite that's as smooth as
linoleum.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Its surface is gorgeous, but so slick that a sign at the trailhead
warns, &quot;This park possesses dangerous natural features. Please supervise
children.&quot; Dogs have a hard time, too.</p>
<p>Water tumbles where it can, creating frothing rapids and waterfalls that
must be epic in spring. Potholes were drilled into the rhyolite along
with unusually large, oval percussion marks, which look like the
footprints of a shaggy, 10,000-pound beast.</p>
<p>Trails follow both sides of the river, connected by bridges. Cliffs line
the north side, and the south banks are dark with trees — hemlock,
sugar maple, yellow birch, and Canada yew. Part of the area is the Dells
of the Eau Claire River state natural area.</p>
<p>From Wisconsin 29, 15 miles east of Wausau, take County Road Y north
from Hatley.</p>
<p>For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/wausau-wisconsin-whitewater-paddling/">Wausau's liquid
assets</a>.</p>
<h3>Rib Mountain State Park in Wausau</h3>
<p>This hill, rising from the marshy plains around Wausau and visible from
miles away, looks like something remarkable, if not the state's high
point. It's only the fourth-highest now, at 1,940 feet, though it's the
tallest hill when measured from the plain that surrounds it.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wausau_high_point.jpg" alt="Rock mark the high point on Rib Mountain." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Atop Rib Mountain in Wausau, a pillar of rock marks the high point.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A road winds to the top, where a climb up the 60-foot observation tower
affords one the region's great views. <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/ribmt/">Rib Mountain State
Park</a> trails radiate from the
top of the mountain, all lined by fractured quartzite.</p>
<p>In winter, it's a good place to snowshoe, and naturalists lead guided
hikes in January and February.</p>
<p>The park is just south of the junction of Wisconsin 29 and U.S. 51. For
more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-wisconsin/winter-wausau/">Winter in
Wausau</a>.</p>
<h3>Devil's Lake State Park near Baraboo</h3>
<p>This one place, just south of Baraboo, tells the entire geological story
of this area. Pink quartzite cliffs, prized by climbers, once was sand
at the edge of an iron-rich ocean, and ripple marks show where waves
washed 2 billion years ago.</p>
<p>An ancient river cut the canyon but was plugged by debris carried by the
last glacier, causing the rise of the spring-fed lake, often called the
state's clearest. The former riverway still can be seen plainly from the
West Bluff Trail, stretching into the horizon.</p>
<p>Hundreds of 800-ton quartzite blocks lie along the west side of the
lake, tumbled from the bluffs.</p>
<p>On the East Bluff Trail, hikers weave among stacks of fractured rock
that have inspired such names as Balanced Rock and Devil's Doorway.</p>
<p>From the East Bluff Trail, the Ice Age Trail continues to Parfrey's
Glen, the state's oldest natural area, an unparalleled hike of 10 miles
one-way. The glen is a very narrow gorge with walls of
plum-puddingstone, globes of quartzite embedded in sandstone.</p>

Lake</a>.</p>

Lake</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=200">Pewits Nest state natural area</a> near Baraboo</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_lake_pewits_nest.jpg" alt="Pewits Nest SNA near Baraboo." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Pewits Nest state natural area near Baraboo is a narrow gorge with
scalloped sides.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This creek gorge that was named for &quot;an individual who lived in the
solid sandstone, like a gnome in a cavern ... this dwelling resembled
the nest of a phoebe (or peewit, an earlier name for this bird), hence
dubbed by early settlers the 'Peewit's Nest.'&quot;</p>
<p>It's surrounded by farm fields, which makes it seem otherworldly.
Dozens of tiny terraces form the moist walls of the gorge, and from the
top, trails lead to a black pool fed by a small waterfall on Skillet
Creek.</p>
<p>A canopy of cedar, pine, hemlock and birch covers the gorge, adding to
the hidden quality.</p>
<p>From U.S. 12 south of Baraboo, head west on County Road W. It's 1½
miles to a small parking area. Don't park on the road.</p>
<p>For more about the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/circus-world-baraboo/">Baraboo's gilt
complex</a>

Hills</a>.</p>
<h3>Kettle Moraine State Forest</h3>
<p>This rocky, boggy forest is where city folk from Milwaukee, Madison and
Chicago go for fresh air and a dose of wilderness.</p>
<p>It's in two parts: the Northern Unit is just west of Sheboygan, and the
Southern Unit is west of Milwaukee and Racine. Both are threaded with
hiking, mountain biking and cross-country skiing trails.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/e/kettle_moraine_parnell.jpg" alt="The view from Parnell Tower." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A trail leads to the Parnell Tower in the Northern Unit of Kettle
Moraine State Forest.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kmn/index.html">Northern
Unit</a>, the 3½-mile
Parnell Tower Trail takes hikers to the Parnell Esker and a 60-foot
observation tower. The Henry S. Reuss Ice Age Visitor Center schedules
naturalist programs throughout the year.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kms/">Southern Unit</a>, the
popular Scuppernong Trail has three loops of various lengths at the
intersection of Wisconsin 67 and County Road ZZ north of Eagle.</p>
<h3>Potawatomi State Park, Sturgeon Bay</h3>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/Potawatomi/">Potawatomi State Park</a>
is the eastern trailhead of the Ice Age Trail. From a 75-foot
observation tower that supplies a panoramic view across Green Bay, a
three-mile stretch of the trail hugs the waters of Sturgeon Bay.</p>
<p>Twisted cedars jut out of craggy blocks of limestone, and it seems
hidden away, though much of it is near Shore Road. This is the kind of
trail children love, with lots of nooks and crannies to explore.</p>
<p>For hikers, this is as good as it gets. For more about Sturgeon Bay, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/sturgeon-bay/">The door to Door County</a>.</p>
