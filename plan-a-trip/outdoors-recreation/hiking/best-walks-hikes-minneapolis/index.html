<p>When you're a tourist, you don't always <em>want</em> to get &quot;off the beaten
path.&quot;</p>
<p>We visited Portland for the first time one Labor Day, and all we knew is
that it's an outdoorsy town. So we were looking for a nice hike in
Forest Park, one of the nation's largest municipal forests with 80
miles of hiking trails.</p>
<p>Wow! Except we only needed four or five of those miles. Surely, we
thought, there's a &quot;best hike&quot; that all the locals know about. Nope
-our guidebook, maps and the local hikers forum were useless.</p>
<p>Now we understand that first-time tourists don't need or have time for
the whole smorgasbord-they'd just like to try one or two signature
dishes.</p>
<p>So here's our Minneapolis version of what we were looking for in
Portland: five hikes that are scenic, easy to find and show off the city
at its best.</p>
<p>All of them take about an hour and can be extended easily. And they're
all along <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/2243/maps">Grand Rounds National Scenic
Byway</a>, which makes a
big loop around the city.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>If you want to ride a bike, too, there are <a href="https://www.niceridemn.org/">Nice
Ride</a> stations all along the route.</p>
<h3>Lake Harriet loop</h3>
<p>This is the hike I thought of longingly when we were searching for a
Portland hike. It's three miles around and unfailingly beautiful, with
a Victorian-style bandshell, two family beaches, a rose garden and water
dotted with sailboats.</p>
<p>There's a free concert nearly every summer night, boat rentals, the
<a href="http://www.breadandpickle.com">Bread &amp; Pickle</a> cafe, a restored
<a href="https://trolleyride.org/como-harriet-streetcar/">streetcar</a> that
travels the few blocks between Harriet and Calhoun and a posh new
playground on the hill above the bandshell.</p>
<p>Idyllic? Pretty much. There's no better way to spend an afternoon in
the Twin Cities.</p>
<p><em>How to get there</em> : There's a pay parking lot on the north end, near
the bandshell. From downtown, take I-35W to 36th Street and go west to
Lake Calhoun. Follow Calhoun Parkway south, turning left on William
Berry Drive. It's .4 mile to Lake Harriet.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_creek_walk.jpg" alt="Walking trail along Minnehaha Creek." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A trail follows both sides of Minnehaha Creek from the falls to the
Mississippi.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The north lot often is jammed, though there's parking on nearby
streets.</p>
<p>To approach from the less-congested south, take 50th Street west from
I-35W to Lynnhurst Park, either parking there or on streets around South
Beach, a quarter-mile away.</p>
<p>There also are pull-outs along Lake Harriet Parkway (traffic goes
counter-clockwise) and spots along the Rose Garden.</p>
<p><em>Extending your hike</em> : It's another 3½ miles up and around Lake
Calhoun on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/minneapolis-chain-lakes/">Chain of
Lakes</a>. Or, head east of
Lake Harriet along Minnehaha Creek.</p>
<h3>Minnehaha Creek from Lynnhurst to Portland</h3>
<p>On this two-mile stretch of the Grand Rounds, you'll be surprised
you're in the middle of a metropolitan area of more than 3 million. The
shady walking trail winds away from the bicycle trail but closely
follows Minnehaha Creek, often crossing it on graceful wrought-iron
bridges.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Traffic on some of the city's busiest streets stays overhead, leaving
the trail quiet and secluded as it winds through the Tangletown
neighborhood.</p>
<p><em>How to get there</em> : Park at Lynnhurst Park on 50th Street (see Lake
Harriet Loop, above) or on Portland Avenue and 50th Street, where
you'll find a giant bronze bunny.</p>
<p>Looking for a winter hike? When Minnehaha Creek is frozen, it's a
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/minnehaha-creek-snowshoe/">great place to snowshoe</a>.</p>
<h3>Minnehaha Falls to the Mississippi River</h3>
<p>Minnehaha Falls, where Minnehaha Creek tumbles 53 feet into a
sandstone-lined bowl, has been a tourist attraction since the first
steamboat carried tourists up the Mississippi in 1820.</p>
<p>But it became famous after the 1855 publication of Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow's 'Song of Hiawatha,&quot; and schoolchildren paid for the
Jacob Fjelde's 1911 statue of Hiawatha preparing to carry the maiden
Minnehaha across the water.</p>
<p>A stone stairway leads to the bottom of the falls. From there, a wooded
walking trail lined by crumbling sandstone bluffs follows the creek on
both sides to the banks of the Mississippi River.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_river_walkway.jpg" alt="Raised walkway over river in Minneapolis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A raised walkway follows the river north of the Franklin Bridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>At dusk, the creek often is lined with egrets looking for fish.</p>
<p>In the park, there are bike rentals, an ice-cream stand and the popular
<a href="http://seasalteatery.wordpress.com/">Sea Salt</a> seafood eatery.</p>
<p><em>How to get there</em> : There's plenty of parking in lots around Minnehaha
Park, which also is easy to reach by light rail. The 46th Street stop on
Hiawatha Avenue/Minnesota 55 is half a mile north of the park.</p>
<h3>Mississippi River flats</h3>
<p>The gorge between downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul is the only
one along the Mississippi, and there are trails along its wooded sides
as well as on East and West River Parkway.</p>
<p>It's a 2½-mile loop between the Franklin and Washington bridges through
the University of Minnesota campus. Start on the southeast end of the
Franklin Bridge, descend a staircase and walk north on an elevated
walkway over the river.</p>
<p>From the university's boathouse in East River Flats Park, walk up (or
take the elevator from the river road) to the Frank Gehry-designed
<a href="http://www.weisman.umn.edu/">Weisman Art Museum</a>, where admission is
free.</p>
<p>Cross the Washington Avenue Bridge, follow the marked trail through the
campus and walk past the Ted Mann Concert Hall back to the river.</p>
<p><em>How to get there</em> : Park on Franklin Avenue or city streets on either
side of the Franklin Bridge. Spots closer to the university are metered.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_river_flats.jpg" alt="Walking on the river flats in Minneapolis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Walking trails follow the east side of the river below the Franklin
Bridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Extending your hike</em> : It's another three-mile loop from the Franklin
Bridge to the Lake Street Bridge. From the southeast east end of the
Franklin Bridge, descend the staircase to a wooded trail that follows
the river for ¾ mile before returning to East River Parkway.</p>
<p>On the southwest end of the Franklin Bridge, you can drop into the woods
that line the gorge by following the Winchell Trail, which passes a
large white-sand beach.</p>
<p>If you're willing to do a little bushwhacking, you can walk in woods
all the way from Franklin to the rowing-club boathouse at Lake Street
and on to 44th Street.</p>
<h3>St. Anthony Falls Heritage Trail</h3>
<p>It's hard to believe the 1883 <a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/stonarch.htm">Stone Arch
Bridge</a>, with 23
arches that gracefully curve as they cross the river below St. Anthony
Falls, almost was torn down after rail traffic ended.</p>
<p>Today it's the beating heart of the city, carrying throngs of
bicyclists, runners and walkers between the museum-theater Mill District
and the St. Anthony Main dining-entertainment district.</p>
<p>It's a 3½-mile loop on walking trails from the Stone Arch Bridge to the
Plymouth Bridge. The walk to the Broadway Bridge adds a mile.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_grain_belt_walk.jpg" alt="Walking past the Hennepin Avenue bridge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A couple pass the Hennepin Avenue Bridge and the old Grain Belt Brewery
sign.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>You'll see the <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/minneapolis-riverfront/">greatest hits of
Minneapolis</a>
on this riverfront loop, starting with Mill City Museum and the Guthrie
Theater. On West River Parkway, the path passes the Federal Reserve and
a playground at 4th Avenue, six blocks east of Target Field.</p>
<p>Just north of the Broadway Bridge, the Twin Cities River Rats water-ski
team performs free shows on Thursday evenings in summer. On the east end
of the bridge, turn onto Ramsey Street, walk to 8th Avenue and turn
right toward Boom Island Park.</p>
<p>On the south end of the park, a 1901 trestle bridge leads to wooden
steps that will take you to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/nicollet_island.htm">Nicollet
Island</a> and
some of the city's oldest houses, including 1877 French Second Empire
stone rowhouses on Grove Street.</p>
<p>Pass under the Hennepin Avenue Bridge, where the first bridge across the
Mississippi was built, to the pavilion, where more trails wind around
the south end of the park.</p>
<p>An 1887 trestle bridge crosses the channel to St. Anthony Main; look up
and you'll see the 1857 Lady of Lourdes, the city's oldest church.
Turn right onto a cobblestone path that leads to Water Power Park, where
you can walk to the river's edge and read about the milling era.</p>
<p>Just past Water Power Park, you can take the Lower Trail down to the
river, in the old mill runoff area. Up on the bluff, the trail continues
to Father Hennepin Bluffs Park and back to the Stone Arch Bridge.</p>
<p><em>How to get there</em> : Park on city streets or at Boom Island Park. If you
park around heavily monitored St. Anthony Main, carefully read the meter
and watch your time.</p>
