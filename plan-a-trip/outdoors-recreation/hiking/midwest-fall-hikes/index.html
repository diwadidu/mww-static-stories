<p>An autumn Saturday dawns, sunny and mild. It's a perfect day for hiking
— but where?</p>
<p>This time of year, you could walk down the street and see something
nice.</p>
<p>But if you're looking for the kind of hike that makes you marvel at
nature and feel glad to be alive, you'll probably have to look a little
farther afield.</p>
<p>Here are 30 of our favorite fall hikes. A few require a little huffing
and puffing, but most are easy strolls. And they all showcase fall at
its finest.</p>
<h3>NORTHERN MINNESOTA</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/regions/eastern/ObergMountainTrail/index.shtml">Oberg
Mountain</a>
between Tofte and Lutsen.</strong> This two-mile loop is the most popular fall
hike in Minnesota, especially when colors peak in the inland maple
forests, usually at the end of September.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There are frequent overlooks, with views of Leveaux Mountain and Britton
Peak to the west, Lake Superior to the south and maple forest to the
east.</p>
<p>The trail is a spur of the Superior Hiking Trail, which includes many
other spectacular hikes. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">Hiking the North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>To get there, take Minnesota 61 east of Tofte to Forest Road 336, or
Onion River Road. It's two miles up to a parking area.</p>
<p><strong>Highland to North 24th Avenue West segment of the <a href="http://shta.org/trail-section/mnwi-border-to-duluth/">Superior Hiking
Trail in Duluth</a>.</strong> Many stretches of this trail off Skyline Parkway have great views, but
one of the most serene is just east of the Highland Street/Getchell Road
trailhead.</p>
<p>The heavily wooded trail passes the ruins of a pump house on Keene
Creek, follows Brewer Ridge through maple and oak forest and emerges to
a grassy open spot with panoramic views of the St. Louis River estuary,
the Aerial Lift Bridge and, on the next hill, Enger Tower.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_peace_ridge.jpg" alt="Superior Hiking Trail in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Duluth, the Highland/Getchell section of the Superior Hiking Trail
offers views of the city.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's about three miles out and back, but you can also turn it into a
superb six-mile loop hike. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/superior-hiking-trail-duluth/">Hiking in
Duluth</a>.</p>
<p>To get there, follow Skyline Parkway east from the Thompson Hill
Information Center or west from Haines Road/40th Avenue West. There's a
parking area at the intersection of Highland, Getchell and Skyline
Parkway.</p>
<p><strong>Lakewalk in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/best-duluth-minnesota/">Duluth</a>.</strong>
Most tourists stick to the Canal Park end of this seven-mile paved path.
Lake Superior is very scenic, but it's when the trail ducks a block or
two inland that you'll see the most colors.</p>
<p>To avoid Canal Park congestion, park at the Rose Garden, off London Road
at 13th Avenue.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/index.html">Itasca State
Park</a> between
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/park-rapids-minnesota-resorts/">Park Rapids</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/bemidji-bunyan-minnesota/">Bemidji</a>.</strong> This is a hiking park, with lots of selection. From the headwaters,
the mile-long Schoolcraft Trail follows the North Arm of Lake Itasca,
ending at Hill Point.</p>
<p>There are giant pines along the half-mile Bohall Trail ** to Bohall
Lake, off Wilderness Drive, and along Nicollet Trail, which starts off
Wilderness Drive near Elk Lake.</p>
<p>The most popular trail is the Dr. Roberts Nature Trail , which starts
near Douglas Lodge. It's a two-mile loop.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/itasca-park-tips/">The people's
park</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/banning_kettle_river.jpg" alt="The Kettle River in Banning State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Minnesota's Banning State Park, the Quarry Trail follows the Kettle
River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/banning/index.html">Banning State
Park</a> near
Sandstone.</strong> People tend to whiz by this park on their way from the
Twin Cities to the North Shore. But its trails are gorgeous, especially
the Quarry Trail, which follows the Kettle River.</p>
<p>The 1.8-mile trail, most of it along an abandoned railroad bed, is lined
by rock outcroppings and includes the ruins of a rock crusher,
powerhouse and cutting house. The park is right off I-35.</p>
<p><strong>Cut Lake Trail in <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_forests/sft00019/index.html">Foot Hills State
Forest</a>
near Pine River.</strong> In fall, most people ditch Minnesota's lake country
in favor of the North Shore. But the leaf color is beautiful and,
because it's varied, lasts longer.</p>
<p>The trail system has 10 miles of hiking loops through a rolling forest
of Norway pine, birch and tawny oaks.</p>
<p>From Minnesota 371 in Pine River, head 10 miles west on County Road 2.</p>

<h3>SOUTHERN MINNESOTA</h3>
<p><strong>River Parkways in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/best-walks-hikes-minneapolis/">Minneapolis</a>.</strong>
Along the Mississippi, side-by-side biking and walking trails line East
River Parkway and West River Parkway, and more trails wind through the
wooded sides of the river gorge.</p>
<p>Bridges provide frequent views and allow hikers to make loops: 2½ miles
from the Washington to Franklin bridges, three miles from Franklin to
Lake Street and five miles from Lake Street to Ford Parkway.</p>
<p><strong>Carleton College <a href="http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/arb/">Arboretum</a> in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/">Northfield</a>.</strong> In the &quot;Arb,&quot; three loops with 7½ miles of trails take hikers past
oak savanna and prairie being restored by the college. The area lies on
the floodplain of the Cannon River.</p>
<p>It's just northeast of downtown, even walking distance; keep going on
Division Street past Carleton's stadium.</p>
<p><strong>Barn Bluff in <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Red
Wing</a>.</strong> This
big, boxy bluff sits right in the path of the Mississippi, which had to
make a sharp turn to get around it.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/e/red_wing_barn_bluff_hikers_fall.jpg" alt="Hikers on Barn Bluff." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Hikers on Red Wing's Barn Bluff have a panoramic view of the
Mississippi River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The main path follows the north side of the 343-foot bluff and passes a
vertical rock face frequented by climbers. At the north end of the
bluff, there's an overlook and a grassy slope that faces town.</p>
<p>From there, hikers can watch traffic crawl past the brick storefronts
and grain elevators of Red Wing and barges chug toward St. Paul. On the
south end of the bluff, there's a view of the river as it widens into
Lake Pepin.</p>
<p>From downtown Red Wing, East Fifth Street leads straight to the foot of
Barn Bluff.</p>
<p>For more river hikes with views, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mississippi-river-views/">Mississippi
panoramas</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/great_river_bluffs/index.html">Great River Bluffs State
Park</a>
near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/winona-minnesota-fun/">Winona</a>.</strong>
At this blufftop park, the King's Bluff Nature Trail provides views of
the river valley as well as Queen's Bluff, a state scientific and
natural area that can be hiked only with a permit.</p>
<p>From the road, the trail cuts through meadow, then enters forest.
Passing through corridors of trees, red with sumac, it emerges to a
panorama of the valley far below-the patchwork delta of the Black
River, the labyrinthine channels traversed by tiny barges, the Wisconsin
ridge tops dotted by farms.</p>
<p>It's 2½ miles round-trip. Another five miles of trails lead to other
scenic vistas.</p>
<p>The park is 20 miles south of Winona. From U.S. 61, take Minnesota 3,
also Apple Blossom Scenic Byway. From Interstate 90, take County Road
12.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_fall_view.jpg" alt="A fall view in Whitewater State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Dakota Trail in Whitewater State Park includes many overlooks.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/whitewater/index.html">Whitewater State
Park</a> near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/fun-in-rochester-minnesota/">Rochester</a>.</strong> This is the place to go for late color, thanks to the many oaks and
maples covering its hillsides. Hike the four-mile Dakota Trail and
you'll have spectacular views from three overlooks on craggy blufftops.</p>
<p>For an easier time, hike the two-mile Meadows Trail and look up at
200-foot cliffs; the view's nearly as good.</p>
<p>The park is half an hour east of Rochester and west of Winona.</p>
<h3>NORTHERN WISCONSIN</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.nps.gov/sacn/planyourvisit/hiking.htm">Sandrock Cliffs
Trail</a> near
Grantsburg.</strong> This scenic five-mile loop through pine and hardwood
forest is part of St. Croix National Scenic Riverway along the Wisconsin
side of the St. Croix River. It follows a terrace along the river, with
river views.</p>
<p>It's just north of Wisconsin 70, near Grantsburg, Wis.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/cnnf/recarea/?recid=27739">Porcupine Lake
Wilderness</a>
near <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-cable-wisconsin/">Cable</a>.</strong> Seven
miles of the North Country National Scenic Trail winds through this
wilderness. There are three parking areas, and from the middle one
there's a half-mile spur trail to Porcupine Lake.</p>
<p>To reach it, take County Road M two miles east to Lake Owen Drive. Turn
north and drive 11 miles to Forest Road 213/Porcupine Lake Road, then
two miles east.</p>
<p>A bonus to this hike is that all of the roads used to reach it are
excellent fall-color drives.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://eeinwisconsin.org/net/content/go.aspx?s=90177.0.16.2209&amp;mode=p">Forest Lodge Nature
Trail</a>
near Cable.</strong> This trail packs a lot into two miles, leading hikers
from a dark hemlock grove to a little bog circled by spruce and covered
with the tufted white heads of cotton grass.</p>
<p>From Cable, go east on County Road M for nine miles and turn onto
Garmisch Road.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/cnnf/recarea/?recid=27749">Morgan
Falls</a> and
<a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/regions/eastern/StPetersDome/index.shtml">St. Peter's
Dome</a>
near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/ashland-wisconsin/">Ashland</a>.</strong> This trail is a two-fer, with a waterfall and a sweeping view. Morgan
Falls, which zigzags 70  to 100 feet down jagged granite, is just half a
mile from the trailhead.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wausau_dells_eau_claire_hiking.jpg" alt="Hiking in Dells of the Eau Claire." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Trails follow and cross the river in Dells of the Eau Claire County Park
near Wausau.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then it's another 1.2 miles, uphill on rocky terrain, to the overlook
from St. Peter's Dome.</p>
<p>To get there from Cable, head north on U.S. 63, and 5½ miles past Grand
View,  turn east on County Road E and drive six miles. Turn south at the
county line and take the gravel Ashland-Bayfield Road 4½ miles to the
trailhead parking lot.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/index.asp?SNA=109">Dells of the Eau Claire
River</a>
near <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/wausau-wisconsin-whitewater-paddling/">Wausau</a>.</strong>
This is one of the greatest hits of the Ice Age, on an extremely
picturesque stretch lined with tilted bedrock and metamorphic rock so
slick that a sign at the trailhead warns, &quot;This park possesses dangerous
natural features. Please supervise children.&quot; Even dogs have a hard
time on it.</p>
<p>Trails follow both sides of the river, connected by bridges. Cliffs line
the north side, and the south banks are dark with trees-hemlock,
sugar maple, yellow birch and Canada yew.</p>
<p>From Wisconsin 29, 15 miles east of Wausau, take County Road Y north
from Hatley.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.timmshilltrail.com">Timm's Hill Trail</a> near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/timms-hill/">Ogema</a>.</strong> This beautiful 10-mile trail connects
Wisconsin's high point in Timm's Hill County Park to the Rib Lake
section of the Ice Age National Scenic Trail. It's six miles east of
Ogema.</p>
<h3>SOUTHERN WISCONSIN</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_croix_falls_interstate_trail.jpg" alt="A trail in Wisconsin's Interstate Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Interstate State Park, the Pothole Trail follows the clifftops above
the St. Croix.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/interstate/">Interstate State
Park</a> in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/stcroix-falls/">St. Croix
Falls</a>.</strong> The
clifftop Pothole Trail is another of the state's great trails and also
the start of the Ice Age National Scenic Trail.</p>
<p>You'll see the cylindrical holes drilled into rock by water and also
views of action on and along the river: rock climbers, canoeists,
paddlewheeler cruises.</p>
<p>It's just across the river from Taylors Falls, Minn., off U.S. 8.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.7bridgesrd.org">Seven Bridges Road</a> near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Trempealeau</a>.</strong> This quiet trail, built on a raised bed through floodplain forest,
once led to a hamlet on the Black River. It's lined by five rare
bowstring-arch truss bridges, all listed on the National Register of
Historic Places.</p>
<p>It's a 3.7-mile hike to the Black River and back through Van Loon
Wildlife Area.</p>
<p>From Trempealeau, drive seven miles east on Wisconsin 35 and turn left
on Amsterdam Prairie Road. The parking lot is a mile up on the left.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/devilslake/">Devil's Lake State
Park</a> near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake/">Baraboo</a>.</strong> It's
safe to say this park has the most spectacular trails in the state.</p>
<p>For a 2½ mile loop, follow the West Bluff Trail atop the bluffs that
ring the lake, and return on the Tumbled Rocks Trail, through a field of
800-ton boulders.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/sheboygan_park_dunes.jpg" alt="Dunes at Kohler-Andrae State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Boardwalks cross the dunes of Kohler-Andrae State Park near Sheboygan.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For a 4½-mile loop, hike the East Bluff Trail and return on the East
Bluff Woods Trail. You'll see Balanced Rock, plunked on the edge of a
cliff, and the Devil's Doorway. Nothing is flat, and everything is
spectacular.</p>
<p>For more along the Ice Age National Scenic Trail, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/best-hikes-ice-age-trail/">Greatest hits of
the Ice Age</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Parnell Tower Trail in the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kmn/index.html">northern Kettle
Moraine</a> near
Plymouth.</strong> The 3½-mile Parnell Tower Trail loop takes hikers to the
Parnell Esker and a 60-foot observation tower.</p>
<p>It's part of one of the most developed segments of the Ice Age National
Scenic Trail, and see even more kames, kettles and eskers throughout the
state forest.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kohlerandrae/">Kohler-Andrae State
Park</a> near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/sheboygan-wisconsin/">Sheboygan</a>.</strong>
This park is famous for its Lake Michigan beaches, but in fall, the dune
grasses turn golden. Boardwalks cross the giant dunes, and there's a
half-mile accessible trail.</p>
<p>From Sheboygan, head south on I-43 and get off at County Road V.</p>
<p><strong>Geneva Lake path in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/walking-lake-geneva/">Lake
Geneva</a>.</strong> This lake is circled
by a public 21½-mile walking path through the lawns of old-money
mansions, many with landscaping that's beautiful in every season.</p>
<p>At least two hiking clubs plan fall hikes of the whole thing, the
<a href="http://www.foresttrailshc.com">Forest Trails Hiking Club</a> of Chicago
and the <a href="https://wisconsingohikingclub.weebly.com/">Wisconsin Go Hiking
Club</a> of Milwaukee.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/white_pines_trail.jpg" alt="Sleepy Hollow Trail in White Pines Forest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

crosses two creeks.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>NORTHERN ILLINOIS</h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/Parks/Pages/WhitePinesForest.aspx">White Pines Forest State
Park</a> in
Mount Morris.</strong> In this gorgeous park just west of Oregon, the 1.2-mile
Sleepy Hollow Trail follows ridges above Pine and Spring creeks, which
it crosses four times, and in places has so many tree roots it's like
walking over vertebrae. Plenty of maples add reds and yellows to the
mix.</p>
<p>Seven other trails wind through the park, some from the log White Pines
inn and restaurant.</p>
<p>There are more hiking trails on the bluffs across from Oregon in <a href="https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/Parks/Pages/Lowden.aspx">Lowden
State Park</a>,
which has a spectacular view of the Rock River valley from the 48-foot
statue of Black Hawk, and along the river in <a href="https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/Parks/Pages/CastleRock.aspx">Castle Rock State
Park</a>, just
south of Oregon.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/Parks/Pages/StarvedRock.aspx">Starved Rock State
Park</a> in
Utica.</strong> The woods around the canyons in this park are beautiful in
fall. There are guided hikes every weekend from the visitor center.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/recreation/greenwaysandtrails/Pages/IMCanal.aspx">I&amp;M Canal State
Trail</a>
between Joliet and LaSalle.</strong> This former towpath winds 61½ miles along
the Illinois River, passing many small towns and historic sites.</p>
<p>Because it's flat, near parking areas and quiet-the surface is
finely crushed limestone, so it doesn't attract a lot of high-speed
bicyclists-it's well-suited to wheelchairs.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/decorah_phelps_park.jpg" alt="Phelps Park in Decorah." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From Decorah's Phelps Park, trails follow the bluffs above the Upper
Iowa River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>EASTERN IOWA</h3>
<p><strong>Phelps Park in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/decorah-iowa-norwegian-heritage/">Decorah</a>.</strong> This college town in northeast Iowa bluff has a picturesque setting,
framed by bluffs. From Phelps Park, a one-mile trail follows the
blufftop above the Upper Iowa River, with limestone steps and terraces
built by the CCC.</p>
<p>The trail ends at the now-famous Rock Cut through limestone, which
completed the 11-mile paved Trout Run Trail around town.</p>
<p>From Water Street downtown, take Mechanic Street to Phelps Park and Main
Street to the Oneota parking lot.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.nps.gov/efmo/index.htm">Effigy Mounds National Monument</a>
near Marquette.</strong> Eleven miles of trails wind along the blufftop in
this national monument, named for 195 burial mounds left by an ancient
people.</p>

<h3>UPPER PENINSULA OF MICHIGAN</h3>
<p><strong>Escarpment Trail in <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State
Park</a>
near Silver City.</strong> The four-mile Escarpment Trail is the most romantic
of this park's 90 miles of trails.</p>
<p>It follows a ridge 300 feet above Lake of the Clouds, from which the
Carp River winds away into the horizon through old-growth forest that's
considered the biggest and best of its kind east of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>From Wakefield, Mich., head north on Michigan 28 and 64. When you get
there, you'll be on Eastern Standard Time.</p>
<p><strong>Presque Isle River in <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State
Park</a>
near Wakefield.</strong> On the west side of the park, four waterfalls line
the last mile and a half of the wild Presque Isle. Follow the West River
Trail and see how the river has cut the rock along its banks.</p>
<p>To get there, take County Road 519 from Wakefield on U.S. 2.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/black-river-michigan/">Black River

Bessemer.</strong> Five waterfalls line the last two miles of the Black River
before it flows into Lake Superior. A trail connects them, part of the
North Country National Scenic Trail.</p>
<p>To get there, follow County Road 513 from Bessemer on U.S. 2.</p>
