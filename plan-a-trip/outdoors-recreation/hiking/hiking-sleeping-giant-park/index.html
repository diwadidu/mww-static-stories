<p>On the northwest corner of Lake Superior, a 1,000-foot-high sleeping
giant stretches across the horizon.</p>
<p>It's mesmerized onlookers for millennia. In 2007, Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. listeners voted it No. 1 of Seven Wonders of Canada, far
outpolling Niagara Falls.</p>
<p>From Hillcrest Park in Thunder Bay, it looks exactly like a cigar-store
Indian, with a square jaw and arms folded over a powerful chest.</p>
<p>From the city's Marina Park, wrapped in the glowing pinks and blues of
sunset, it looks like a spirit — and Ojibwe legend says that it's
Naniboujou, turned to stone.</p>
<p>But to hikers on the tip of the 32-mile-long Sibley Peninsula, where the
rock giant sleeps, he's a big Gulliver, there to be scaled.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On a trip in July, we planned to hike the Head Trail and Chest Trail
first, then the Top of the Giant Trail overlooking the Knees. But epic
humidity brought a wall of fog from the cold lake, and all the views
from the giant's mesas disappeared.</p>
<p>So we turned to the attractions in the giant's shadow: a pristine inland
lake with a big sand beach; a historic silver-mining village; trails to
Lake Superior bays that were lined with wildflowers.</p>
<p>Sleeping Giant Provincial Park is a favorite destination of Thunder Bay
residents, tourists on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/circle-tour-lake-superior/">Lake Superior Circle
Tour</a> and
backpackers and campers.</p>
<p>For a wilderness experience laced with luxury, there's nowhere else like
it. For three nights, we camped on Marie Louise Lake on a secluded site
that was much like those in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.</p>
<p>On the fourth night, we camped on a choice spot in the quiet campground,
watching as beavers and duck broods swam by our own pebble beach.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/i/giant_campground.jpg" alt="Marie Louise Lake Campground at Sleeping Giant." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Campers can swim and kayak from sites in Marie Louise Lake Campground.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We ate camp food but treated ourselves to root-beer floats and blueberry
pie with ice cream from the Silver Islet general store. We were camping,
but it wasn't exactly roughing it.</p>
<h3>Heading for the Giant</h3>
<p>In summer, the road to the Sleeping Giant Provincial Park is lined by
billowing clumps of ox-eye daisy, yellow bird's foot trefoil and purple
bird vetch.</p>
<p>Even in July, the sun is up until 10 p.m., so we didn't hurry to our
campsite on Lake Marie Louise Lake.</p>
<p>It was a four-mile drive on gravel roads from the main campground, and
we had to bring in water, but we had our own wooded nook on the lake,
with no sign of human habitation within sight.</p>
<p>As we unpacked, we met our neighbor Mike Moland, a board member of
Friends of the Sleeping Giant.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;The park people act as if it's a punishment to camp here, but I think
it's a reward,&quot; he said. &quot;I go to Quetico a lot, and they're a lot like
the campsites there.&quot;</p>
<p>The previous night, he'd heard wolves howling: &quot;It was like listening in
3D, they were howling from so many locations,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In the morning, the lake was like glass, but the birds were making a
ruckus. A loon took off, sounding a loud rat-a-tat-tat as it slapped the
water with its feet, and a merganser duck swam by with her brood,
wheeling and turning like wind-up toys.</p>
<p>We had a swim, then drove to Silver Islet on the tip of the peninsula.
The village was the jumping-off spot for the miners and engineers who,
between 1868 and 1884, pulled $3.25 million in silver from a tiny rock
dome a kilometer off the coast.</p>
<p>Tendrils of fog brushed our skin, and the temperature was 10 degrees
cooler than the campground three miles away. Just across from the
marina, we could see only the outline of Burnt Island, like a battleship
with fir-tree masts.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/i/giant_middlebrun_bay.jpg" alt="Middlebrun Bay at the Sleeping Giant." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Scaly stone pokes out of the water at Middlebrun Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We couldn't see the point of climbing up the Giant only to see fog.
Instead, we hiked to nearby Middlebrun Bay, passing several families
with young children, some carrying body boards, who had spent the whole
day there.</p>
<p>The curving sand beach was a beauty, with outcrops of red-and-white
stone as scaly as a crocodile's back.</p>
<p>One of the park's unusually placid deer saw us and approached, then was
distracted by a tasty plant. At the edge of the surf, old log timbers
had been turned into a teeter-totter.</p>
<p>Isle Royale lay just 15 miles over the water, but we could barely see
the ends of the bay.</p>
<p>So we looked down instead, to the uncommon wildflowers along the trail,
including white and pink pyrola and twinflower, the tiny blooms that
Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus named Linnaea borealis, for himself.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/i/giant_pink_corydalis.jpg" alt="Corydalis on Tee Harbor in Sleeping Giant." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>A day of discoveries</h3>
<p>The next day, we found hundreds of twinflower along the Kabeyun Trail,
which follows the edge of the peninsula.</p>
<p>The 6½ kilometers to Tee Harbor were flat and relatively easy, but when
we saw mountain bikers on the trail, we realized it would be easy to
knock off the first eight kilometers by bike, reserving energy for the
uphill climbs to the Giant.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel stupid for walking,&quot; said my husband. &quot;We could have
ridden bikes and done 40K in a day.&quot;</p>
<p>We revised that thought when we saw the beautiful campsites along the
sand beach, each in a roomy wooded grove with a fire pit.</p>
<p>It would be even better to backpack in and use Tee Harbor as a base
camp, we decided, hiking up the Giant and also to the Thunder Cape Bird
Observatory at the Giant's feet.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/i/giant_kabeyun_trail.jpg" alt="Kabeyun Trail in the Sleeping Giant." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Kabeyun Trail passes Perry Bay near the Sea Lion.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The harbor, a Finnish fisherman's camp in the 1920s, is a destination in
itself. Sitting on a log eating lunch, I realized that the pebbles at my
feet were liberally salted with agates and quartz.</p>
<p>Walking farther along the T-shaped peninsula, we found a giant slab of
volcanic rock, flat enough for 500 people to picnic on and covered with
bright-orange lichen and the fattest, happiest harebells we'd ever seen.</p>
<p>There was a kiddie pool of rainwater and more wildflowers, including
cinquefoil and peach and yellow corydalis.</p>
<p>We'd thought Tee Harbor was a great place to skip stones, but continuing
along the Kabeyun Trail, we found Lehtinen's Bay, where every single
stone, each as flat as a licorice pastille, was perfect for skipping.</p>
<p>On the bluff above, the fire pit of a campsite had been tiled in the
larger stones, like a suburban patio.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/i/giant_beach.jpg" alt="The beach on Marie Louise Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The big sand beach of Marie Louise Lake Campground is never crowded.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was buggy, though, so we hightailed it back, stopping near the
trailhead to walk along Perry Bay to the Sea Lion. It was shrouded in
fog, but we could see the famous rock arch, whose head and mane fell
away in the 1920s and now looks more like an anteater.</p>
<h3>Pie and wildflowers</h3>
<p>The next day, we hiked the Ravine Lake Trail loop from the Kabeyun
Trailhead, and it turned out to be nonstop scenery, from a blufftop view
of Grassy Lake to a rock-wall gallery and a serene lake dotted with the
yellow flowers of bullhead lily.</p>
<p>On the boggy edge, I spotted purple marsh skullcap, and on the trail I
saw the tiny one-flowered wintergreen, possibly the most exquisite
wildflower of them all, with its plump star-shaped petals, scalloped
edges and pale-green nozzle.</p>
<p>We could hear a foghorn booming, but this time when we got to Silver
Islet, Burnt Island was visible from the deck of the old-fashioned
tearoom, where we had slices of warm homemade pie and ice cream.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/i/silver_islet_store.jpg" alt="Silver Islet General Store at the Sleeping Giant." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Silver Islet General Store has changed little since it was the
mining-company store.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The sun was bright and the air humid, but cool air wafted over our skin.</p>
<p>We spent the end of the afternoon swimming at the huge beach on Marie
Louise Lake and our last night at one of the best campsites in Marie
Louise Lake Campground, at the tip of the point.</p>
<p>Our neighbors were Keven Bender and Gareth Pritchard of Thunder Bay, who
were there for two weeks and also spend every other weekend in the park
and another week in August.</p>
<p>They'd brought mountain bikes and sea kayaks, and they also hike, hunt
for mushrooms, bird watch and swim and fish right from their campsite.
In the winter, they rent one of the cabins and ski.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd like to see some other places, but it's just hard to leave this
park,&quot; Bender said.</p>
<p>After just four days at the Sleeping Giant, we felt the same way. We're
already planning our next trip. Orchid hunting in June? Thimbleberry
picking in August? The views would be nice, too, but on this trip, I
didn't really miss them.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Sleeping Giant Provincial Park</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  It's 83 miles from Grand Marais, Minn., to <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/thunder-bay-summer/">Thunder
Bay</a>, then 26
miles to the turnoff to the Sibley Peninsula and 20 miles to the park
office at the Lake Marie Louise Campground.</p>
<p><em>What to know:</em>  Eastern Standard Time starts at the Minnesota-Ontario
border, so you'll lose an hour. Be sure to have a <em>passport,</em>  passport
card or enhanced driver's license, if you're from Minnesota, Michigan
or other states that issue them.</p>
<p>If you're bringing a child not your own, you must have notarized
permission from parents. If you're bringing a pet, you need vaccination
records (pit-bull breeds are not allowed). For complete information,
check the <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Canada.html">State Department Canada
page</a>.</p>
<p>You can use U.S. dollars if you like; most Canadian businesses accept
them at a fair rate.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/i/giant_campground_ducks.jpg" alt="Ducks on Marie Louise Lake Campground." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Ducks cluster at the edge of the point in Marie Louise Lake Campground.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>What to bring:</em> You'll want to bring everything you need; in Thunder
Bay, you can stock up on food at the Safeway on the southwest corner of
TransCanada Highway 11/17 and Red River Road. The park sells firewood
and ice, and the <a href="https://silverisletgeneral.ca/">Silver Islet General
Store</a> sells treats and staples.</p>
<p>If you want to cover the most mileage hiking, bring mountain bikes,
which also are handy for getting around the campground and riding to
Silver Islet. The Silver Islet general store also rents them.</p>
<p>Canoes and kayaks can be rented for use on Marie Louise Lake. If you
want to kayak on Lake Superior, bring your own.</p>
<p>If you plan to swim from your campsite, bring water shoes so you can
walk on rocks. The beach, however, is all sand and has a gradual
drop-off, perfect for kids. There's no lifeguard.</p>
<p><em>Reserving a campsite:</em>  They can be reserved five months in advance at
888-668-7275 or online at <a href="https://reservations.ontarioparks.com/">Ontario
Parks</a>, which shows photos of
each site. In the regular campground, the waterfront sites on the point
— sites 138-141 and odd-numbered sites 143-167 — are most desirable
and cost a little more. There are two very nice, clean shower houses.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/i/giant_tee_harbor.jpg" alt="The beach at Tee Harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Thunder Mountain is visible from the beach at Tee Harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Sites 310-319 are right on the lake, but they're a four-mile drive from
the campground on gravel roads — and because it's a one-way road,
it's another seven miles back to the campground. There's no water
source or showers, just two latrines.</p>
<p>Sites 310-313 are very private, but campers need to tote everything they
need down a winding path; site 311 has the best view and lake access.
Sites 314-319 are open to the road, but cars can pull right up to the
sites.</p>
<p><em>Park activities:</em>  Naturalists give daily programs in the amphitheater.
There's a visitor center with displays about the park flora, fauna,
geology and history, plus a park store.</p>
<p>The Friends of the Sleeping Giant host special weekends, such as the
Festival of the Giant in August, which includes a corn roast,
sand-castle contest, games and a pancake breakfast.</p>
<p>On the first weekend of March, cross-country skiers come for the
<a href="http://www.sleepinggiantloppet.ca/">Sleeping Giant Loppet</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/i/giant_tee_harebells.jpg" alt="Tee Harbor at Sleeping Giant." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Harebells grow from crevices in the T-shaped peninsula that forms Tee
Harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Hiking:</em>  Bring mosquito repellent and hiking boots for walking on the
rocky and root-choked trails.</p>
<p>You'll get only a rudimentary trail map with the visitor guide; the
Friends of Sleeping Giant sell a much more useful map.</p>
<p>The marquee trails are to the Top of the Giant and Head of the Giant,
both difficult. The Top of the Giant is 11 kilometers one-way from the
Kabeyun South trailhead; you can expedite the first 8 kilometers on the
Kabeyun Trail by riding it on a mountain bike.</p>
<p>The Head Trail is 7 kilometers one-way via the inland Sawbill Lake and
Sawyer Bay trails or 8 kilometers one-way from the Kabeyun Trail
junction on Lehtinen's Bay.</p>
<p>Backpacking sites line the trails. Some people camp in Tee Harbour or
Lehtinen's Bay and make day hikes to the Knees, Chest and Head of the
Giant.</p>
<p>Other fine trails include the 1.5-kilometer Ravine Lake Nature Trail
loop and the trail to Middlebrun Bay on Lake Superior, where some
families like to spend the day swimming and playing on the unusual red
beach outcroppings.</p>
<p>The trail to Middlebrun Bay is about half the 4.2 kilometer one-way
distance of the trail, which extends to Finlay Bay but isn't all that
scenic. The map shows a campsite at Finlay Bay, but it was nearly
nonexistent.</p>
<p><strong>Cabins:</strong>  Five three-bedroom
<a href="https://www.ontarioparks.com/roofedaccommodation/rusticcabins/sleeping-giant-rusticcabins">cabins</a>
with modern kitchens and bathrooms on the lake in Marie Louise
Campground are available from mid-September through mid-May. Reserve
directly with the park.</p>
