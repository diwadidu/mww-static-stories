<h2>On eight great day hikes, get a taste of this 65-mile trail through Minnesota's canoe country.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/o/border_route_view.jpg" alt="A view of the Boundary Waters from the Border Route Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The view of Watap Lake is one of the trail's best.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In Minnesota canoe country, hikers get serious bragging rights by
backpacking the Border Route Trail.</p>
<p>This 65-mile trail roughly parallels the Ontario border, mostly through
the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. The volunteers who maintain
it can't use mechanized tools there, and signs aren't allowed.</p>
<p>Navigation isn't easy, and hikers frequently have to dodge blown-down
trees.</p>
<p>They don't have to dodge other people, though. <a href="http://www.backpacker.com/destinations/13247?page=5">Backpacker
magazine</a> praises
the trail's solitude and suggests, &quot;Hike where others paddle.&quot;</p>
<p>Parts of the Border Route are easily reached from the Gunflint Trail and
forest roads off the North Shore. So if you'd like to sample some of
the best scenery with a fraction of the fuss, you can try it on a day
hike.</p>
<p>The western trailhead is nine miles from the end of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/gunflint-trail/">Gunflint
Trail</a>, the 57-mile
highway that starts in Grand Marais and dead-ends near the Canadian
border. It connects with the <a href="http://www.kek.org">Kekekabic Trail</a>,
which heads 41 miles west toward Ely.</p>
<p>The eastern trailhead is on the Swamp River, which flows into the Pigeon
River, the international border. It's not far from historic Fort
Charlotte, at the end of the 8½-mile <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/visiting-grand-portage/">Grand
Portage</a>
that Lake Superior voyageurs used to get into the Canadian interior.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The Border Route does connect with the north end of the <a href="http://www.shta.org">Superior Hiking
Trail</a>, which heads 275 miles down the North Shore
to Duluth and Jay Cooke State Park.</p>
<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4914622/ncta_share/gis/arrowhead_reroute.jpg">All three
trails</a>
are slated to become part of the <a href="http://northcountrytrail.org/">North Country National Scenic
Trail</a> between Montana and New York.</p>
<p>The Border Route Trail was built in the early 1970s by the Minnesota
Rovers Outdoors Club, and many of its members still maintain it on
<a href="http://www.borderroutetrail.org/trailclearing.html">trail-clearing
trips</a> through the
Border Route Trail Association.</p>
<p>Anyone is welcome on the trips, most of which originate in the Twin
Cities. The association also publishes a handy <a href="http://www.borderroutetrail.org/trailguide.html">trail
guide</a> with maps.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-Border-Route-Trail-Meetup-Group/">Border Route Trail Meetup
Group</a> that
schedules weekend and day trips on the trail.</p>
<p>Here are eight great day hikes on the Border Route, chosen and
researched by Madison hiker <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/isawtman/">Todd
McMahon</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/%21ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP0os3gDfxMDT8MwRydLA1cj72BTJw8jAwjQL8h2VAQAzHJMsQ%21%21/?ss=110909&amp;ttype=recarea&amp;recid=40344&amp;actid=50&amp;navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;position=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&amp;navid=110380000000000&amp;pnavid=110000000000000&amp;cid=null&amp;pname=Gunflint+Ranger+District+-+Magnetic+Rock+Trail">Magnetic Rock</a></h3>
<p>Head up the Gunflint Trail (County Road 12) to the Border Route's
western trailhead, 47.8 miles from Grand Marais.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/o/border_route_magnetic.jpg" alt="Magnetic Rock on the Gunflint." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Todd McMahon</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Magnetic Rock is near the western trailhead.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This is the starting point for a day hike to one of the most peculiar
sight in the Boundary Waters-agnetic Rock, a 60-foot upright slab of
rock that makes compasses go haywire.</p>
<p>The trail meanders through rocky hills and valleys burned in the 2007
Ham Lake fire. You'll find Magnetic Rock 1½ miles from the trailhead.</p>
<p>And watch for
<a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/regions/eastern/MagneticRock/index.shtml">wildflowers</a>
-the U.S. Forest Service calls this trail one of the best in the
nation for seeing them.</p>
<h3>Centennial Trail loop</h3>
<p>This 3.3-mile loop was created in 2009 for the 100th anniversary of
Superior National Forest and also is in the area burned by the 2007 Ham
Lake fire.</p>
<p>It's actually part of the Kekekabic Trail, whose eastern trailhead is
just a block from the Border Route's western trailhead.</p>
<p>Hike west on the Kek, and you'll pass a spur trail to the former site
of the Old Gunflint Tower. Then you'll see the shaft of the ill-fated
Paulsen Mine, filled with water and surrounded by a split-rail fence.</p>
<p>Half a mile from the mine, the Centennial Trail takes a sharp left off
the Kek and starts heading southeast on a grade once used by the Port
Arthur, Duluth &amp; Western. This Canadian railroad crossed into the United
States at the Gunflint Lake Narrows to reach the Paulsen Mine, which
yielded only one trainload of iron ore.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The trail goes back to the Gunflint Trail along the old railroad grade,
taking one detour up to a scenic overlook. It passes <a href="http://tuscaroracanoe.com/">Tuscarora Lodge
and Outfitters</a> on Round Lake, then
parallels the Gunflint Trail until it meets the Kek trailhead.</p>
<p>The U.S. Forest Service provides a handy <a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5199621.pdf">PDF of the
trail</a>.</p>
<h3>South Rim</h3>
<p>This four-mile section, popular with cross-country skiers in winter,
follows a ridge with spectacular views of Gunflint Lake.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gunflint.com">Gunflint Lodge</a> and <a href="http://www.gunflintpines.com">Gunflint
Pines</a> resort are at the western end, and
<a href="http://www.hestons.com">Heston's Lodge</a> is at the eastern end. When you
are done, you can either walk back to your car using the Lonely Lake ski
trail or arrange with one of the resorts to take you back to your car.</p>
<h3>Bridal Veil Falls</h3>
<p>There's one more easy day hike in the Upper Gunflint area. Park your
car on North Loon Lake Road, near Heston's, and hike west on the Border
Route for three miles.</p>
<p>Along the way, the trail skirts the shoreline of Loon Lake, then follows
a ridge with great views of the eastern end of Gunflint Lake.</p>
<p>The area near Loon Lake was not burned by the Ham Lake fire, but the
ridge was, and you'll be able to see a stark contrast.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/o/border_route_270.jpg" alt="Overlook of the Pigeon River valley." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Todd McMahon</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the east end of the trail, there's a 270-degree overlook of the
Pigeon River valley.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Eventually, you'll see Bridal Veil Falls, a 10-foot-wide chute of
fast-moving water. A short spur leads to the main part of the falls.</p>
<p>The falls also can be reached from the south, using the Crab Lake Access
Trail to connect with the Border Route. Park your car on Loon Lake Road
(County Road 51) on the southeast side of the lake, near <a href="http://www.visitloonlake.com/">Loon Lake
Lodge</a>.</p>
<h3>Stairway Falls and Rose Lake</h3>
<p>In the Central Gunflint area, hikers can reach two of the trail's most
scenic spots-and getting there is even easier if you use a canoe.</p>
<p>From the Gunflint Trail, drive up Hungry Jack Road to the Caribou Rock
Trailhead. You can walk to Stairway Falls using the four-mile Caribou
Rock Trail.</p>
<p>It offers fantastic views but is one of the more difficult trails in the
Boundary Waters. If you have some canoeing skills, there's an easier
way: Rent a canoe from <a href="http://www.hungryjacklodge.com">Hungry Jack
Lodge</a>.</p>
<p>Then paddle across Bearskin Lake and haul your canoe across the 400-yard
portage into Duncan Lake.</p>
<p>Once on Duncan Lake, canoe up to Stairway Portage and park your canoe
near the portage landing. The portage trail connects with the Border
Route Trail.</p>
<p>Spectacular Stairway Falls is near the trail junction and a large wooden
staircase that canoeists use to portage from Duncan Lake to Rose Lake.</p>
<p>If you hike east of Stairway Falls on the Border Route for 1/8 mile,
you'll get to the iconic overlook of Rose Lake, a favorite of
photographers.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Watap Cliffs</h3>
<p>This seven-mile hike also starts in the Central Gunflint, on 6-mile-long
Clearwater Lake, one of the few BWCAW lakes where motorboats are
allowed.</p>
<p>Take Clearwater Road to <a href="http://clearwaterhistoriclodge.com/">Clearwater Lake
Lodge</a>, where you will have called
ahead to reserve a motorboat drop-off at the Two Mile Campsite, farther
down the lake.</p>
<p>When you get to the campsite, start walking on the spur that connects to
the Border Route Trail on top of the bluff. Take a right, and in less
than a mile, you'll reach the Watap Cliffs, an amazing spot that
overlooks Watap Lake.</p>
<p>Head back, but this time, when you get to the campsite spur, stay on the
Border Route. The trail will take you down to Rove Lake. Be thankful
that you are going down on this section, instead of going up.</p>
<p>Then the Border Route follows the shoreline of Rove Lake for about a
mile until it comes to the portage to Daniels Lake. Take the portage
trail for about ¾ mile until you reach the junction with Long Portage
and the Daniels Lake Access Trail.</p>
<p>Take a left onto the Daniels Lake Access Trail. The trail is a former
railroad bed, so it's nice and flat as it follows Daniels Lake for two
miles. Then the trail takes a left turn, and after another mile, you'll
reach Clearwater Road.</p>
<p>Take a right, and you'll soon be back at Clearwater Lake Lodge.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/o/border_route_stairway_falls2.jpg" alt="Stairway Falls on the Border Route Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Torsten Muller</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Stairway Falls is reached from the Central Gunflint.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>John Lake Overlook</h3>
<p>The next two hikes are on the eastern part of the trail and are reached
from Minnesota 61 on the North Shore.</p>
<p>From Grand Marais, drive 19 miles along Lake Superior to Hovland. From
there, drive 17 miles inland on the Arrowhead Trail, or County Road 16.</p>
<p>The Arrowhead Trail is paved for only three miles; the rest is a gravel
road. Park at the Border Route trailhead on McFarland Lake and cross the
bridge that separates McFarland Lake and Little John Lake.</p>
<p>The road takes a sharp turn, and you'll find the Border Route about 50
yards to your right.</p>
<p>For the first quarter-mile, the hike is flat. Then you'll climb for
more than half a mile to the John Lake Overlook.</p>
<p>You can continue hiking along the ridge, which has views of the lake
below, but the first overlook is the best. It's about a mile; head back
to the trailhead the way you came.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/o/border_route_john.jpg" alt="John Lake on the Border Route Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Todd McMahon</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
John Lake is reached from the McFarland Lake trailhead.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Pigeon River Cliffs</h3>
<p>For your easternmost day hike, drive back down the Arrowhead Trail for
about six miles, to the junction of Otter Lake Road.</p>
<p>Drive east on Otter Lake Road for about three miles, to the eastern
trailhead of the Border Route Trail. There is a parking area off Otter
Lake Road with a kiosk.</p>
<p>From here, you can either hike 1½ miles out and back to a spectacular
overlook, or you can do a 7½-mile loop with several overlooks.</p>
<p>If you are doing the short version, just hike up the Border Route for ¾
mile and take a short spur trail to a spectacular 270-degree overlook.</p>
<p>If you are doing the long version, hike west on Otter Lake Road for 2½
miles. This portion of the hike isn't very scenic. Then take a trail to
the right known as the Otter Lake Cutoff, on the east side of Otter
Lake.</p>
<p>The Otter Lake Cutoff goes through a clear-cut area, then down a hill to
meet up with the Border Route Trail.</p>
<p>Take a right on the Border Route and start a gradual uphill ascent to
the first in a series of overlooks over the next four miles, on the
Pigeon River Cliffs section of the trail.</p>
<p>You'll see about four overlooks, then descend and go through a
clear-cut area. Up another hill, you'll see two more overlooks; the
second is the 270-degree overlook from the short hike.</p>
<p>From there, it's ¾ mile back to the eastern trailhead.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/o/border_route_gunflint_lake.jpg" alt="The view of Gunflint Lake from the Border Route." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Todd McMahon</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3>Trip Tips: Hiking the Border Route Trail</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Grand
Marais</a>, the jump-off
for the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/gunflint-trail-general/">Gunflint Trail</a>, is 4½ to 5 hours from the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>It's another hour to the western trailhead of the Border Route on the
Gunflint and also to the eastern trailhead off the Arrowhead
Trail/County Road 16.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : Expect quite a few ticks, flies and mosquitoes in late
May and June. Many people think the best time to hike the trail is
between snowmelt and bug arrival, usually in early May, or after the
first frost in September.</p>
<p><em>What to bring</em> : Most importantly, bring a map and compass. Also bring
warm, non-cotton clothing, snacks and either water or a water filter to
purify water taken from lakes or creeks.</p>
<p>You'll also need strong insect repellent, and consider spraying your
clothes with Permethrin to ward off wood ticks as well as <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/lyme-disease/">deer
ticks</a>.</p>
<p>Since you won't have cell-phone reception, you'll need an emergency
kit in case you lose your way and need to spend a night in the woods.</p>
<p>Backpacker magazine suggests this lightweight survival kit, which can
fit into a fanny pack: an emergency blanket, two fire starters (a cheap
butane lighter is best), signaling device (a whistle, if nothing else),
knife or razor blade and a square of heavy-duty aluminum foil for making
a cup or cookpot.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/survival-tips-outdoors/">Don't be a dope in the
woods</a>.</p>
<p><em>Day permits</em> : You can fill out free permits for day hikes at
trailheads.</p>
