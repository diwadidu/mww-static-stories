<p>Out in the forest, solitude can be overrated.</p>
<p>Occasionally, we all need silence. But you may have more fun if you play
follow the leader.</p>
<p>When I go on a hike, especially if I don't know the area well, I like
to tag along with naturalists. Thanks to them, I've learned all kinds
of interesting things.</p>
<p>In the Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park on the Upper Peninsula,
former naturalist Bob Sprague knows just about everything there is to know
about the park — he wrote the book on it, &quot;Porcupine Mountains
Companion.&quot; So, when I was there one September, I went along on his
Black Bear Habitat hike.</p>
<p>Since we weren't likely to see bears, he showed us many signs of them
— a rotten log ripped apart by a bear looking for grubs; claw marks on
a red oak, where a bear was reaching for acorns; and a clump of fur on the
branch of a small red pine, where a bear had bitten off the top and
others had rubbed, leaving their scents.</p>
<p>He also told amusing anecdotes about the Bill Clintonesque appetites of
bears (fried chicken, bacon, pastries) and their tendency to run off
with the Girl Scouts' pancake mix.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>On the North Shore for the smelt run in mid-May, I went on a Superior
Hiking Trail Association hike from the Knife River. Duluth naturalist
Dave Benson went along, pointing out a beaver dam, a cluster of wild
leeks, a broadwing hawk. He also showed us the round galls formed by
insects on woody stems; now, whenever I see one, I think of him.</p>
<p>Along the Mississippi in Wisconsin's Wyalusing State Park, I hiked atop
500-foot bluffs, past effigy mounds along Sentinel Ridge and into
Treasure Cave, an aerie of ocher limestone with two passages.</p>
<p>It was tempting to spend hours just looking at the views, but I was glad
I joined a hike by naturalist Jaye Maxfield, who explained why staghorn
sumac is called the Indian lemonade tree and why prickly ash is the
toothache tree.</p>
<p>Now, I follow a simple rule: If someone is willing to tell me something
interesting, I'll show up and hear it. (For guided fall-color hikes,
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/guided-fall-hikes/">Along for the walk</a>.)</p>
<h3>Join the club</h3>
<p>Sometimes, it's just fun to tag along with other people.</p>
<p>One fall, I went with nine other people on a Sierra Club hike in Afton
State Park in the Twin Cities, not so much to learn about the park but to learn about other
people who like parks. The leaders, Dawn Wilson and Teresa Nick of St.
Louis Park, had recently moved from southern California.</p>
<p>&quot;If you move and you're a member of an international club, you just
join the local chapter,&quot; Nick said.</p>
<p>A Burnsville woman also was a recent arrival, as was Dan Maas of St.
Paul, a recent graduate of UW-Madison. Will Gayther of Eden Prairie also
had just started his career, so the two commiserated about life in
cubicles.</p>
<p>Wilson had brought a tree-identification book, and along the way she
pointed out signs of glaciation, identified an oak savanna and showed us
a prairie being restored.</p>
<p>&quot;When I'm the leader, I like to not just get to a destination, but
enjoy what we see along the way,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Other clubs were out hiking Afton State Park's trails as well — Women
and Men who Cross-Country Ski, or WAMXC, clicking along with ski poles;
and Outwoods, a Twin Cities gay and lesbian outdoors club whose members
were having a medallion hunt in the park.</p>
<p>At the end of the five-mile walk, Wilson reminded us to stretch and stay
hydrated throughout the day. Then we all left, reconvening in Afton for
ice cream.</p>
<p>In the coulee country of Wisconsin, it was a Sierra Club hike that
helped launch Bob Lee's busy career as a volunteer naturalist on the La
Crosse River State Trail.</p>
<p>A member of the Wildcat Mountain State Park staff was on the hike, and
she recruited him to lead regular walks along the trail near Sparta,
pointing out wildflowers and other plants found on a sand prairie.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we've awakened a few people to some special places, and
that's what's important to me,&quot; Lee said. &quot;People don't have to
walk very far to see something they didn't even know was there.&quot;</p>
<p>He'd always been intrigued by the local flora and fauna, Lee said. But
it was a 1960s visit by Alvin Peterson, &quot;the bird man of Onalaska,&quot;
that got him started as a naturalist.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Peterson's hearing and eyesight were failing, so he'd switched to
studying wildflowers, and he recruited Lee to go out with him. Lee was
stunned by the breadth of Peterson's knowledge.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought, 'I've got to learn this stuff,' &quot; he said. &quot;So, I went
to Sears and bought a single-lens reflex camera, then I went to La
Crosse and bought a copy of 'Gray's Manual of Botany,' and that's
how I learned my plants.&quot;</p>
<h3>Volunteer effort</h3>
<p>In the state parks, volunteers like Lee are helping to bolster
naturalist programs that have been ravaged by budget cuts.</p>
<p>Nonprofit groups also recruit naturalists and geologists to go along on
hikes open to the public. On Nature Conservancy hikes, naturalists and
field reps lead hikes to areas the group owns or has helped protect,
such as Magney-Snively Forest in Duluth.</p>
<p>The forest is city parkland, but developers tried to take it for a golf
course until it came under the protection of the Duluth Natural Areas
Program, which the Nature Conservancy helped develop.</p>
<p>On the first Saturday in June, the northeast Minnesota office and other
branches celebrate National Trails Day by hosting a hike.</p>
<p>&quot;It gets you some exercise and also the opportunity to stop, observe
and learn,&quot; said Jana Pastika of the office in Duluth.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Guided hikes</h3>
<p>All over the region, parks and nonprofit groups offer guided hikes that
are free and open to the public. Here are some of the best places to
look for them.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/groups/club-travel/">Join the
club</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, check the schedules of wildlife refuges, nature centers,
environmental learning centers and conservancy groups.</p>
<p><em>Ice Age National Scenic Trail:</em> The foundation, based in Cross Plains,
Wis., coordinates the many local chapters, who offer hikes and other

<h3>Hiking clubs</h3>
<p>Hiking clubs hold walks throughout the year, often as part of overnight
trips. Generally, participants on day hikes needn't be members.</p>
<p>In addition to the clubs, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/">Meetup</a> groups everywhere schedule hikes.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.mnrovers.org">Minnesota Rovers Outdoors Club</a>:</em> It's based
in the Twin Cities and holds weekend and Wednesday-evening hikes as well
as backpacking trips.</p>
<p><em><a href="www.north-stars.org">North Stars Ski Touring Club</a>:</em> It's based in the Twin Cities and often
holds day hikes as well as weekend hiking trips around the region.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://wisconsingohikingclub.weebly.com/">Wisconsin Go Hiking Club</a>:</em>  It's based in Milwaukee and plans four
hikes a week in southeast Wisconsin and beyond.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.foresttrailshc.com/">Forest Trails Hiking Club</a>:</em>  This club, founded in 1942, is based in
the Chicago area and holds weekend day hikes in northeast Illinois and
beyond, typically of 10 to 12 miles.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.stpaulhike.com/">St. Paul Hiking Club</a>:</em> It was founded in 1921 and holds many hikes
around the Twin Cities.</p>
