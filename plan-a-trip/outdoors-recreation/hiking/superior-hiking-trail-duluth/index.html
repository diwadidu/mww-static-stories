<h2>The city sections of the Superior Hiking Trail are easy to reach and amazingly scenic.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_shta_hiking.jpg" alt="Hiking to Enger Park in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Piedmont Knob, hikers are 700 feet above Lake Superior.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>To many people, it's still a revelation that Duluth is one of the best
places to hike, not just in Minnesota but in the nation.</p>
<p>It's a city of 86,000, after all. But this hillside town, once called
the San Francisco of the North, has spectacular terrain for trails,
along glacial beach terraces high above Lake Superior and on creeks that
tumble down rocky ravines.</p>
<p>Many hikers blow through Duluth on their way to sections of the Superior
Hiking Trail farther up the North Shore. But the 43 miles that cross
Duluth provide the most concentrated scenery on the entire trail, lake
views and waterfalls included.</p>
<p>&quot;We never thought we'd be able to put a trail like that through the
city of Duluth, but we did,&quot; says Gayle Coyer of the Superior Hiking
Trail Association. &quot;Duluth is so amazing. In so many areas, you're
going to think you're in a remote forest on the North Shore.&quot;</p>
<p>And in a city, hikers don't have the logistics problems of wilderness
hikers: how to get back to the car and where to eat and drink.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Hikers can take buses to or from most trailheads; the fare is 75 cents
on weekends and between 9 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. on weekdays (otherwise
$1.50).</p>
<p>They can also leave bicycles at the end of their hikes, or hike one of
three loops. And the trail goes by restaurants in West Duluth, East
Duluth and on the Lakewalk.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em>  Before you go, check the <a href="http://shta.org/trail-conditions/">Trail
Conditions</a> page of the Superior
Hiking Trail Association website.</p>
<h3>East Duluth, between downtown and the colleges</h3>
<p>Perhaps the easiest hike in Duluth — which doesn't mean it doesn't
have hills — also is our favorite. It's the <em>4½-mile stretch between
Hartley Park,</em>  in the hills above the University of Minnesota-Duluth,
and the <em>Rose Garden</em> above the Lakewalk.</p>
<p>It starts at Hartley Nature Center and, from Hartley Pond, winds through
the park's vast woods.</p>
<p>From the other side of Hartley Park, it crosses Arrowhead Road to UMD's
Bagley Nature Area and a balcony view of the city and lake.</p>
<p>From the campus (to stay in the woods, walk on the mountain-biking trail), it's all downhill to <em>Chester Park,</em>  where you can
admire the waterfalls of Chester Creek as it flows down a rocky,
cliff-lined gorge to Fourth Street and Burrito Union.</p>
<p>On the restaurant's deck overlooking Lake Superior, we have lunch (and
perhaps a beer from Fitger's Brewhouse) while waiting for the <a href="http://www.duluthtransit.com/timetable/current/13">No. 13
bus</a>, which comes at
about 10 minutes past the hour on weekends and whisks us back to
Hartley.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_highland_golds.jpg" alt="Superior Hiking Trail in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
East of Getchell-Highland, a hiker walks through maple forest in Brewer
Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Or we walk the four blocks to the Rose Garden and toward Canal Park on
the Lakewalk, and catch the bus from Superior Street downtown.</p>
<h3>West Duluth from Getchell and Highland</h3>
<p>Possibly the most scenic stretch of the Superior Hiking Trail through
Duluth starts at the junction of Skyline Parkway with <em>Getchell and
Highland avenues.</em></p>
<p>From here, it's 9.4 miles east to downtown, mostly downhill.</p>
<p>It's especially scenic in fall, because after the trail passes an old
stone pump house on Keene Creek, it enters maple forest in Brewer Park.
Then it emerges to an open ridge with panoramic views of the harbor.</p>
<p>On the section between Getchell and <em>Haines Road,</em>  you can also hike
the 3.4-mile Brewer Park Loop.</p>
<p>East of Haines Road, the hillier Piedmont section passes many knobs —
rock faces protruding from the hillside— then arrives at Miller Creek and
the <em>N. 24th Avenue W.</em> trailhead, just off Piedmont Avenue.</p>
<p>You don't even have to double back. For an excellent <em>6-mile loop hike</em>
that we call &quot;The Greatest Hits,&quot; park your car at N. 26th Avenue
W. and W. 3rd St., at the foot of Lincoln Park, and take the <a href="http://www.duluthtransit.com/timetable">No. 3
bus</a> up Highland Avenue to the
Getchell trailhead on Skyline Parkway. After crossing Miller Creek in
Lincoln Park, turn right instead of left and follow the creek trails straight
down to your car.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>If you keep going on the Superior Hiking Trail from Lincoln Park, it's just a quarter mile up to the
24th Avenue West trailhead and then 1.7 miles to <em>Enger Park,</em> famous
for its stone tower, flower gardens and replica of an ancient Japanese
bell. The stone outcroppings on the park's edge have the city's
best-loved view of Canal Park.</p>
<p>From <em>Enger Park/Twin Ponds,</em>  it's a surprisingly scenic 2 miles to
the <em>Lakewalk.</em>  The trail descends the hillside through birch forest
and overgrown Central Park, past elephantine knobs and to the edge of an
old quarry.</p>
<p>There are harbor views there and from a rock clifftop studded with
bolted steel anchors, where you'll be standing high above Michigan
Street and I-35.</p>
<p>A pedestrian bridge over I-35 leads to a path between highway pillars
and on to Bayfront Festival Park and past the Great Lakes Aquarium to
<em>Canal Park.</em></p>
<p>To do the hike with a bus shuttle, park at the Bayfront Park playground, walk to
Superior Street and catch the <a href="https://www.duluthtransit.com/home/getting-there/routes-schedules/">No. 9
bus</a>
to the trailhead at North 24th Avenue West and Skyline Parkway.</p>
<p>If you'd like to walk the 8.8 miles between the Lake Superior Zoo and
N. 24th Avenue W./Piedmont Avenue, you can use the <a href="http://www.duluthtransit.com/timetable/current/5">No. 5
bus</a> for a shuttle.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.duluthtransit.com/timetable/current/9">No. 9 bus</a>
connects the N. 24th Ave. W. trailhead to downtown, and the <a href="http://www.duluthtransit.com/timetable">No. 2
bus</a> runs between Grand Avenue
in West Duluth and the transit center.</p>
<h3>Getchell/Highland to the zoo</h3>
<p>Heading west from Getchell/Highland, it's a mostly downhill 3.2 miles
to the Lake Superior Zoo.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/h/sht_enger_cliff.jpg" alt="Overlooking I-35 on the Superior Hiking Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A rock cliff overlooks the highway on the stretch from Enger Park to
Canal Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's the most varied section of trail . On this stretch, the urban
landscape adds to the mix.</p>
<p>The trail follows Keene Creek to a train bridge, where you'll tread on
dusty red taconite pellets that have fallen out of the cars. Then it
goes through alder forest to Westgate Boulevard, the Allyndale Motel and
Cody Street.</p>
<p>After passing under the giant, graffiti-adorned pillars of I-35, it
enters a sunny expanse of wildflowers, brush and table outcroppings with
views of St. Louis Bay.</p>
<p>When you get to Kingsbury Creek, you may want to spend a little time clambering around on the smooth rocks upstream. Then, hike down to the zoo; we prefer the trail on the west side of the creek. At the zoo, there's an adjoining park with a playground and
bathrooms.</p>
<p>To return to the Skyline Parkway lot where you started, catch the No. 5
bus or No. 2 bus on Grand Avenue to W. 59th St., then catch the No. 3
bus up Highland.</p>
<h3>Zoo to Spirit Mountain and Ely's Peak</h3>
<p>Continuing west from the zoo, the ¾-mile spur trail climbs the
cedar-lined west side of Kingsbury Creek, nearly to I-35, then heads two
miles west through pine forest.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/bardons_peak_fall.jpg" alt="Bardon's Peak in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bardon's Peak overlooks St. Louis Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It descends 138 wooden steps to Knowlton Creek, which it follows down to
the Grand Avenue chalet at <em>Spirit Mountain,</em>  a nice place to have
lunch or a beer.</p>
<p>The return for this stretch would be easy by bike or even foot, since
it's just one mile on Grand Avenue between the zoo and the chalet.</p>
<p>From the chalet, it's a two-mile climb to <em>Magney-Snively Park.</em> The
trail crosses the banked mountain-bike trails of Spirit Mountain —
watch out for speeding bikers — and passes the stone foundation of an
old house and some knobs before emerging onto Skyline Parkway, a
half-mile from the trailhead.</p>
<p>The stretch west of the Magney-Snively parking lot runs through an area
that the Ojibwe consider sacred.</p>
<p>It's 1.9 miles to Bardon's Peak, or 3.8 miles out and back, through
old-growth forest that's especially beautiful in fall. Bring a picnic
and enjoy the views.</p>
<p>Continue another 1.5 miles (6.8 miles out and back) and you'll hike
over a long expanse of rock on the way to <em>Ely's Peak,</em>  which juts
over the valley and gives you an even more spectacular view that
includes the old U.S. Steel plant and town.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Stay long enough, and you'll likely see a train snaking toward you on
the line below.</p>
<p>From Ely's Peak, it's a steep, rocky climb down to <em>123rd Avenue West</em>
and the paved Willard Munger State Trail, a total of 4.3 miles from
Magney-Snively Park. This trailhead also is the best access to the
three-mile Ely's Peak loop.</p>
<p>The 2.7 miles from 123rd Avenue West to <em>131st Avenue West</em>  in Fond du
Lac also are beautiful, crossing Sargent Creek on a wood trestle bridge
as it approaches the Mission Creek area.</p>
<p>The entire length of the trail is thoroughly marked, with blue blazes on
trees, rocks, trailhead posts and, on city streets, stickers affixed to
stop signs and telephone poles.</p>
<p>In the western section, hikers will marvel that trail scouts found such
a perfect route, often high above ravines on little ridges that are just
wide enough for a trail.</p>
<p>At the grand opening of the section from Jay Cooke State Park, I
happened to be hiking just ahead of maintenance supervisor Mark
VanHornweder, so I asked how he and other trailblazers picked a route.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_snively_bridge.jpg" alt="A bridge on the Superior Hiking Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>&quot;It's easier if we wait until the leaves are down, and then we just
kind of roam around,&quot; he said. &quot;Sometimes, we're guided by maps; and
sometimes, it's just dumb luck.&quot;</p>
<h3>Loops</h3>
<p>There's a 3.4-mile loop on the Brewer Park
section between Getchell and Haines Road and a 3.5-mile loop on Spirit
Mountain, most easily reached from the Grand Avenue Chalet.</p>
<p>There's a 1.7-mile loop around Ely's Peak, where you also can see the long cool tunnel of the former Duluth, Winnipeg and Pacific Railway. You can get there from the Beck's
Road/123rd Avenue West trailhead, but it's easier to continue on Beck's Road to the Short Line Park parking area. From there, head right on the DWP trail to the loop and tunnel.</p>
<h3>Shorter walks</h3>
<p>As wonderful as the Superior Hiking Trail is, it's not the only great
trail in Duluth.</p>
<p>The city has more than 50 miles of trail in other scenic spots,
including the Waabizheshikana Trail, formerly Western Waterfront Trail, along
St. Louis Bay; the sandy Park Point Trail from the airport to the
Superior harbor entry; and Congdon Park Trail, up Tischer Creek from
Superior Street.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/duluth-walks/">Walking in Duluth</a>.</p>
<p>The Lakewalk extends from Lester Park to Kitchi Gammi Park on the
edge of town. It's seven miles between Canal Park and Kitchi
Gammi's Brighton Beach, a favorite spot for picnicking and playing in
the lake.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_bagley_view.jpg" alt="The view from Bagley Nature Area." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3>Trip Tips: Superior Hiking Trail in Duluth</h3>
<p>Before hiking, it's always smart to check for <a href="http://shta.org/trail-conditions/">closures and trail
conditions</a>.</p>
<p>In winter, the hiking/running trails become snowshoeing trails, though
so many people use them they quickly become packed.</p>
<p><em>Maps:</em> Information on the <a href="http://shta.org/trail-section/mnwi-border-to-duluth/">Duluth segments of the Superior Hiking
Trail</a> is online,
or pick up maps around town. The &quot;Guide to the Superior Hiking Trail,&quot;
$15.95, also includes maps of the Duluth sections.</p>
<p><em>Bus routes:</em> Check the <a href="http://www.duluthtransit.com/">Duluth Transit
Authority</a> for schedules. Fares are 75
cents weekends and off-peak, $1.50 during commuting hours.</p>
<p><em>Shuttles:</em> The SHTA offers occasional guided hikes at which leaders
organize a shuttle.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.mungerinn.com/">Willard Munger Inn</a>, a hiker-friendly
motel near the Kingsbury Creek/Lake Superior Zoo trailhead in West
Duluth, provides shuttles to guests who want to go to any point on the
Superior Hiking Trail within Duluth city limits (some parts of the trail
between the inn and Jay Cooke State Park are in townships, however).</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_miller_creek.jpg" alt="Hikers cross Miller Creek in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The trailhead of the five-mile <a href="https://duluthmn.gov/parks/parks-listing/waabizheshikana-the-marten-trail/">Waabizheshikana Trail</a>
is next door and across Grand Avenue from the zoo.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/water-sports/duluth-st-louis-river/">Duluth's other
waterfront</a>.</p>
<p><em>Camping:</em> In West Duluth, through-hikers can camp right off the trail
at <a href="https://www.spiritmt.com/campground">Spirit Mountain</a> and very close
at <a href="http://www.duluthindianpointcampground.com/">Indian Point
Campground</a>, on the St.
Louis River.</p>
<p>In East Duluth, there are six rustic sites at <a href="https://umdrsop.d.umn.edu/programs/rental-center/campground">Bagley
Campground</a>
in <a href="https://umdrsop.d.umn.edu/facilities/bagley-nature-area">Bagley Nature
Area</a> on the
University of Minnesota-Duluth campus. Four can be reserved; call
218-726-6134.</p>
<p>There's naturalist programming on weekends, such as canoeing, guided
hikes and skills demos. Campers who don't have gear can rent a tent,
stove, sleeping bags and cooking kit for $55 from the <a href="https://umdrsop.d.umn.edu/programs/rental-center">Rental
Center</a>, including
the campsite. Without gear, it's $25 for up to two tents and six
people.</p>
<p>From June through August, campers can park nearby and walk in. The rest
of the year, the sites are open only to backpackers.</p>
<p><em>Bike shuttles:</em> Many trailheads — Getchell/Highland, Enger Park,
Chester Park — are on <a href="http://www.skylineparkway.org/">Skyline
Parkway</a>, a paved city street and also
a state scenic byway. Just drop a bike at the end of your hike and ride
back to your car when you're finished hiking.</p>
<p><em>What to bring:</em> Water, snacks, sturdy boots and, in summer, insect
repellent. In spring and early summer, be sure to wear long pants and
watch for ticks.</p>
