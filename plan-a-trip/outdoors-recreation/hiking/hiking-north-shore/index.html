<h2>Soak up the scenery above Lake Superior with one of these great day hikes.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/b/oberg_red_camera.jpg" alt="Photographing fall colors on Oberg Mountain." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Minnesota's North Shore, everyone hopes to catch fall colors like
these around Oberg Mountain.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It took me nearly 20 years of hiking on the North Shore to tackle Eagle
Mountain.</p>
<p>It's the highest point in Minnesota, but it's not exactly on the shore;
it's 14 miles inland, as the crow flies. I was used to tramping along
the rocky river gorges whose horehound-tinted waters rivers boil
furiously down to Lake Superior; I was used to drama.</p>
<p>But the 3½-mile hike up 2,301-foot Eagle Mountain was just as dramatic.
The path, a root-choked corridor through cedars and spruce, soon enters
the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.</p>
<p>Passing through bogs, partly on boardwalks, it skirts mirrorlike Whale
Lake, then picks its way through gantlets of rock up to the top.</p>
<p>There, hikers gaze upon a spectacular panorama that includes the North
Fork of the Cascade River and Zoo, Shrike and Eagle lakes, set amid
waves of greens and yellow.</p>
<p>The actual summit is obscured by bushes, but rock cairns point the way
to a plaque and a box, which holds a notebook in which hikers register
their impressions: &quot;I've climbed Eagle Mountain; what's left?&quot; wrote
Jeff of Lakeville.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's no such thing as a bad hike on the North Shore-or if there
is, I haven't found it.</p>
<p>I started with ever-popular Oberg Mountain and then developed other
favorites, such as the trails along the Upper Cascade and the Kadunce
north of Grand Marais.</p>
<p>Usually, I hiked in the state parks, but once I stopped at the
nondescript Ray Bergland Memorial State Wayside, on the hunch there
might be a nice trail from there. And there was, a beauty that followed
the Onion River to a waterfall.</p>
<p>Since then, the Superior Hiking Trail has incorporated many of my hikes
into its 310-mile system, which starts in Jay Cooke State Park and
follows a ridgeline above Lake Superior from Duluth to the Canadian
border.</p>
<p>Cutting along the flank of the Sawtooth Mountains, at some points more
than 1,000 feet above Lake Superior, it crosses dozens of creeks and
rivers, many also lined with trails.</p>
<h3>When to go</h3>
<p>Hiking can be good in early spring, when there are few people on the
trail.</p>
<p>In late spring, mud can be a problem, and ticks are thick in late May
and early June. Disease-carrying deer ticks are not uncommon along the
North Shore; for tips, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/lyme-disease/">How to prevent Lyme
disease</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/split_rock_loop_view.jpg" alt="Hikers on the east side of the Split Rock River loop." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the west side of the Split Rock River loop, hikers follow a ridge
before descending to the trailhead.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Hiking also is good in midsummer, because the heat keeps mosquitoes at
bay during the day, the tree canopy keeps much of the trail shaded and
hikers can take dips in the many swimming holes (use extreme caution
around waterfalls and in rapids).</p>
<p>In late summer, water may run low in streams, so bring as much water as
you need.</p>
<p>Fall is everyone's favorite time to hike. Most people try to hit peak
fall color, generally the last week of September and first week of
October. Late fall also is good; only mountain-ash berries provide
color, but muddy trails harden and falling leaves open up new vistas.</p>
<p>Hiking still is good into November, when hotel rates drop. Just remember
to wear blaze-orange or red.</p>
<p>The deer-hunting firearms season starts the first Saturday in November,
and the Lake County part of the Superior Hiking Trail closes (Cook
County, which is virtually all Superior National Forest, starts five
miles east of Little Marais and continues to the Canadian border).</p>
<p>The grouse and bear seasons start in September and moose season in
October, so it's a good idea to wear bright colors all fall.</p>

<h3>Gooseberry Falls State Park</h3>
<p>Few miss this picturesque park, which straddles the highway.</p>
<p>Eighteen miles of trails wind through the park, but most people will
want to spend their time clambering around on the lumpy floes of ancient
lava that hold up Upper and Lower Falls, and down to the river's mouth
on Lake Superior.</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 39.5</em> (from Duluth).</p>
<h3>Split Rock River loop</h3>
<p>This five-mile loop starts four miles north of Gooseberry, at the mouth
of the Split Rock River; there's a parking area. You'll hike up the
west side of the red-rock gorge and cross on a bridge (you may see
pilings and think the bridge is out, but it's a little farther up).</p>
<p>On the east side, the trail veers away from the river to avoid the
marshy mouth, but there are gorgeous views of Lake Superior from an open
ridge.</p>
<p>The trail then returns hikers to the highway, which they must cross and
walk along a block of paved Gitchi-Gami Trail to a culvert and the
parking lot.</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 43.5</em> .</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_kettle_late_fall.jpg" alt="Devil's Kettle in C.R. Magney State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Kettle.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Silver Bay to Minnesota 1</h3>
<p>This 11-mile section of the Superior Hiking Trail is one of the most
scenic and most challenging, winding past Bean and Bear Lakes in
Tettegouche State Park, then past Round Mountain and Mount Trudee, with
great views of Lake Superior, then High Falls on the Baptism River.</p>
<p><em>Mile markers 54.3</em> (Silver Bay; turn left at Outer Drive and go 1.5
miles to Penn Boulevard/County Road 5, then another half mile and park
in lot on right)
and <em>59.3</em> (Minnesota 1; from there, go 0.8 miles and
park in lot on left).</p>
<h3>Tettegouche State Park</h3>
<p>From the office, a trail follows the Baptism River and merges with the
Superior Hiking Trail. At High Falls, the tallest waterfall completely
within the state, it crosses a suspension bridge, heads back and crosses
again at Two Steps Falls.</p>
<p>And don't miss the half-mile trail to Shovel Point, where basalt
headlands form a coastline that looks more like northern California than
Minnesota. The view, which includes Palisade Head to the south, is
incomparable.</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 58.5</em> .</p>
<h3>Temperance River State Park</h3>
<p>Trails at this park, named because the river has no bar at its mouth,
follow the tortuous course of the Temperance River, seething and
twisting like a flume ride from hell. Pebbles in the swirling water have
scraped potholes in the riverbed and in the sides of the gorge.</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 80.4</em> .</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/carlton_peak_family.jpg" alt="A family of hikers enjoys the view from Carlton Peak." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Carlton Peak</h3>
<p>This massive pile of volcanic rock, whose 924-foot summit commands a
spectacular view up and down the shore, is three miles north of
Temperance via the Superior Hiking Trail.</p>
<p>The other way to reach it is by driving three miles up the Sawbill Trail
(County Road 2) from Tofte to the parking lot at Britton Peak; from
there, it's three miles round-trip.</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 83.4</em> (to the Sawbill Trail).</p>
<h3>Oberg Mountain</h3>
<p>This two-mile hike probably is the most popular on the shore, especially
in spring, when it's lined with wildflowers, and fall, when its many
overlooks provide views of the mountain's inland maple forest.</p>
<p>East of Tofte, take Forest Road 336, or Onion River Road, two miles to a
parking area.</p>
<p>Cross the road to the trail; after a short distance, turn onto the
1.8-mile Oberg loop, which winds around the summit.</p>
<p>From the other side of the parking area, the Superior Hiking Trail leads
to Leveaux Mountain. It's a mile to a spur trail that goes to the
summit.</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 87</em> .</p>

<h3>Lutsen Mountains east to the Caribou Trail</h3>
<p>This popular stretch from the ski hill in Lutsen cuts through maple
forest, passing lovely Lake Agnes on its way to County Road 4, also
known as the Caribou Trail. *
*</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 90</em> .</p>
<h3>Cascade River</h3>
<p>The trails that hug both sides of the river in <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/cascade_river/index.html">Cascade River State
Park</a>
are popular with everyone, especially children. If they're surefooted,
they can jump from boulder to boulder and watch the river crash down to
the lake.</p>
<p>Don't miss the Upper Cascade, where the trail is lined with old cedars
and feathery ferns and hikers can sit on the shore watching the river
tumble over a series of small falls.</p>
<p>It's a challenging but very beautiful eight-mile round-trip up the
river to the County Road 45 bridge and back down.</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 99.8</em> .</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/superior/recreation/recarea/?recid=41628&amp;actid=50">Eagle Mountain</a></h3>
<p>The trailhead can be reached from Grand Marais by taking County Road 7
to Forest Road 48, then 158 to its junction with 153.</p>
<p>It's a little simpler to take the Caribou Trail, or County Road 4, from
Lutsen to Forest Road 153; from there, it's about four miles east to
the trailhead. Fill out free a Boundary Waters day permit and put it in
the box before hiking.</p>
<p>It's a difficult hike. The trail is clogged with rocks and tree roots,
so wear thick-soled shoes or boots. It's seven miles round-trip; allow
three to four hours for the hike itself and, until first frost, bring
insect repellent.</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 110</em> for Grand Marais, <em>92</em> for the Caribou Trail.</p>
<h3>Devil Track River</h3>
<p>On the rim of this deep, narrow canyon is a 2.4-mile stretch of the
Superior Hiking Trail, with views of the red cliffs and waterfalls
below.</p>
<p>To get there, drive five miles north of Grand Marais to County Road 58
and turn; there's a parking area on the left.</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 114</em> .</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/north_shore_hikers_vista.jpg" alt="Hikers enjoy a vista on the Superior Hiking Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Hikers on the North Shore are rewarded with frequent views.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Kadunce River</h3>
<p>From a wayside 10 miles north of Grand Marais, a trail follows the
rust-tinted waters of the Kadunce through its narrow gorge.</p>
<p>It's a spectacular and intimate little hike, 1½ miles round-trip, and
the cobblestone beach opposite the wayside is one of the shore's
prettiest.</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 118.7</em> .</p>
<h3>Judge C.R. Magney State Park</h3>
<p>Trails in this park, named after the populist who proclaimed, &quot;Our
state parks are everyman's country estate,&quot; follow the Brule River
past three waterfalls: the Lower, the Upper and Devil's Kettle.</p>
<p>At the Devil's Kettle, the river splits, half cascading 50 feet into a
pool and the other disappearing into a pothole; no one know where it
ends up. It's 2½ miles round-trip.</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 123.8</em> .</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/split_rock_loop_hike.jpg" alt="Hiking the west side of the Split Rock River loop." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the west side of the Split Rock River loop, part of the trail is
paved in cobblestones.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Grand Portage State Park</h3>
<p>The Pigeon River, which marks the international border, is the largest
on the North Shore and was the bane of voyageurs.</p>
<p>Its lower 20 miles, a series of cataracts and chasms, is unnavigable, so
the paddlers had to make an 8½-mile uphill portage to its upper waters.</p>
<p>Today, visitors can follow a half-mile, handicapped-accessible trail to
the state's tallest waterfall, gorgeous High Falls, cascading 120 feet
over a sheer basalt wall. The Middle Falls Trail goes farther, over
ridge tops, about three miles.</p>
<p><em>Mile marker 150</em> .</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Hiking the North Shore</h3>
<p><em>What to know</em> : Allow an hour for each 1½ miles. Bring water and snacks
and be prepared for sudden weather changes.</p>
