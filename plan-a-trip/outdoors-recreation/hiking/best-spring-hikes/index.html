<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/e/nerstrand_family.jpg" alt="A family hiking at Nerstrand Big Woods." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In southern Minnesota, Nerstrand Big Woods State Park is one of the best
places to find spring ephemerals.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>What's so great about hiking in spring? That's easy-there's so
much to see.</p>
<p>Move your feet in any direction and you'll run across wildflowers,
waterfalls and, best of all, sweeping views that last only until the
trees leaf out.</p>
<p>Head out before summer makes its brash appearance, with walls of
greenery and fleets of bugs.</p>
<p>Here are 20 great places to go hiking in spring. If you especially want
to see a lot of spring ephemerals, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/find-wildflowers/">Where to find spring
wildflowers</a>.</p>
<p>It's too early to worry about mosquitoes or biting flies. But do
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/lyme-disease/">protect yourself</a> from ticks,
especially the deer ticks that carry Lyme disease.</p>
<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/nerstrand_big_woods/index.html">Nerstrand-Big Woods State
Park</a></strong>
near
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/">Northfield</a></strong>
. Just an hour south of the Twin Cities, this is the spot to go if
you're new to spring ephemerals: It's got nearly every kind of
woodland bloom, and a large identification guide to help you identify
them.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>They include thousands of trout lilies, and a few of the very rare dwarf
trout lily. There's even a waterfall, with a pool where children like
to wade.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/whitewater/index.html">Whitewater State
Park</a>
near St. Charles</strong> . Farther south in bluff
country, this park likely is the busiest in the state in May.</p>
<p>That's when morel hunters, fly fisherman and wildflower watchers
converge on the park, surrounded by limestone bluffs. Like Nerstrand, it
has some of nearly every woodland flower .</p>
<p>The best flowers are on the trail to the cart-in campsites near the
Whitewater River. But the best views are from the hiking trails that
scale the bluffs.</p>
<p>For a bonus, visit nearby <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/carley/index.html">Carley State
Park</a>, which
has meadows of bluebells and hillsides covered by false rue anemone. It
celebrates Bluebell Festival in early May, with guided wildflower
walks.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/blue-mounds-minnesota/">Blue Mounds State
Park</a> near
Luverne</strong> . Hike on the edge of quartzite cliffs to
see prairie flowers at this dramatic park in the southwest corner of the
state. Make a loop and you'll run across the resident herd of bison,
which include babies in spring.</p>
<p>Look for prairie smoke, and later, you'll see the yellow blooms of
prickly-pear cactus.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/e/kettle_april.jpg" alt="The Kettle River in spring." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Banning State Park, the Quarry Trail follows the raging Kettle River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/banning/index.html">Banning State
Park</a> near
Sandstone</strong> . This park, halfway between the Twin Cities and Duluth, is
right off I-35. In spring, the Kettle River runs furiously, and if
you're lucky, you'll see whitewater cowboys on its Class V rapids.</p>
<p>The 1.8 mile Quarry Trail follows the river. It's lined by rock
outcroppings and includes the ruins of a rock crusher, powerhouse and
cutting house.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/jay_cooke/index.html">Jay Cooke State
Park</a>
near Carlton</strong> . In this park just south of
Duluth, you'll find lots of wildflowers as well as lots of rushing
water and a suspension bridge over the St. Louis River.</p>
<p>The park also is close to the southern trailhead of the Superior Hiking
Trail.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/regions/eastern/ObergMountainTrail/index.shtml">Oberg
Mountain</a>
between Tofte and Lutsen</strong> . This two-mile
loop hike comes with gorgeous views of Lake Superior and sugar-maple
forest and is most popular in fall. But in late spring, the trail is
lined with a lovely selection of wildflowers.</p>
<p>The turnoff is at mile marker 87 on Minnesota 61. From there, take
Forest Road 336, or Onion River Road, two miles to a parking area.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/cascade_river/index.html">Cascade
River</a>
between Lutsen and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Grand
Marais</a></strong> .
The mouth of
this river, just off the highway, is surrounded by masses of northern
bluebells and fiddlehead ferns, and you can find many less-common blooms
along the trails: goldthread, bluebead lily, Canada mayflower.</p>
<p>For a challenging eight-mile hike, follow river trails up to the County
Road 45 bridge and back down. One Memorial Day weekend, we even found a
morel along the trail.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/wildflowers-spring-north-shore/">Wildflowers of the North
Shore</a>,
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/waterfalls/waterfalls-north-shore-minnesota/">Waterfalls of the North
Shore</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">Hiking the North Shore</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pigeon_river_falls_top.jpg" alt="Top of High Falls on Pigeon River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Ontario side of the border, hikers can climb to the top of High
Falls.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Ontario</h3>
<p><strong>High Falls from <a href="https://www.ontarioparks.com/park/pigeonriver">Pigeon River Provincial
Park</a></strong> . A lot of people
have seen Minnesota's highest waterfall from Grand Portage State Park
on Minnesota's North Shore, and it's impressive in any season.</p>
<p>If you have a passport, cross the border and see it close-up and from
the top. (Check to make sure the border is open.) The trail starts at
the Ontario visitors center. It's really buggy in summer, so spring is
a good time to hike it.</p>
<h3>Wisconsin</h3>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/wisconsin-muir-tour/"><strong>Aldo Leopold's shack near Baraboo and John Muir's childhood farm
near
Portage</strong></a>.
A visit to the sandy Wisconsin River plains to pay homage to these
famous naturalists makes a great Earth Day road trip.</p>
<p>There are also serene nature trails at the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/crane-foundation-wisconsin/">International Crane
Foundation</a>
near
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/circus-world-baraboo/">Baraboo</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/door-county-wildflowers/">Ridges
Sanctuary</a> in
Baileys Harbor</strong> . This is nature preserve
is paradise for anyone who loves wildflowers. The unusual topography â€”
boggy swales interspersed with sandy ridges, next to Lake Michigan beach
â€” make it home for many rare species, including the dwarf lake iris
and Arctic primrose.</p>
<p>Boardwalks cross the swales, and winding paths take hikers through cedar
forest. In June, look for 25 species of orchids.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/perrot/">Brady's Bluff</a> in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Trempealeau</a></strong>
. The hike up this hill in Perrot State Park is as rewarding as it gets.
At the shady, grotto-like base of the hill, you'll see all the
shade-loving wildflowers, such as bellwort and Dutchman's breeches.</p>
<p>Climb a little higher, and you'll find the region's most spectacular
display of fragrant jeweled shooting stars covering the hillside.</p>
<p>At the top, you'll see one of the Mississippi River Valley's most
spectacular views, all the way upriver to Winona. You may even see a few
pelicans and other migrating birds whooshing by, nearly at eye level.</p>
<p>For more hikes to great views, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mississippi-river-views/">Mississippi
panoramas</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/best-hikes-ice-age-trail/">Ice Age National Scenic Trail</a> across
the state</strong> . The thing that makes this
1,000-mile trail across Wisconsin so cool are the landforms â€” eskers,
drumlins, kames and kettles, all created by the retreating glacier.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_geneva_bay.jpg" alt="A pretty bay on Geneva Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Flowering trees line Lake Geneva's Lakeshore Path in spring.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the woods, they're best seen before trees leaf out and cloak them.
Many of the best-loved hikes in the state are along this trail,
including Devil's Lake and Parfrey's Glen near Baraboo and Dells of
the Eau Claire and Rib Mountain near Wausau.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/walking-lake-geneva/">Lakeshore Path</a> in Lake
Geneva</strong> . This 20-mile walk through the
yards of eye-popping historic mansions is gorgeous in spring, though
you'll be seeing garden flowers, not wildflowers.</p>
<p>You may have to dodge docks waiting to be installed, but the landscaping
is top-notch and the views non-stop.</p>
<p>If you don't have a shuttle, get one from Lake Geneva Cruise Line. On
many Sundays, you can walk the eight miles from Lake Geneva to Williams
Bay, where you'll be picked up and served a champagne brunch on the
cruise back.</p>
<h3>Illinois</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/starved-rock-park-illinois/">Starved Rock State
Park</a>
near Utica</strong> . This state park on the
Illinois River, two hours west of Chicago, is magnificent in spring.</p>
<p>It's an easy stroll from the lodge to St. Louis Canyon on the Bluff
Trail, which has one of the region's best display of jeweled shooting
stars.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/starved_rock_bluebell_cliffs.jpg" alt="Bluebells in Kaskaskia Canyon." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Starved Rock State Park, bluebells line the floor of Kaskaskia
Canyon.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For a longer hike, drive to the other side of the park and walk to
Ottawa, Kaskaskia and Illinois canyons, whose moist floors are covered
with bluebells. And bring shoes that can get wet.</p>
<p>Most of the canyons have waterfalls in spring, with the most scenic in
St. Louis, French, Wildcat, Tonty, Ottawa and Kaskaskia canyons.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.dnr.illinois.gov/Parks/Pages/WhitePinesForest.aspx">White Pines Forest State
Park</a> in
Mount Morris</strong> . In this gorgeous park just west of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/oregon-illinois-sightseeing/">Oregon</a>, the 1.2-mile Sleepy Hollow Trail follows ridges above Pine and Spring
creeks, which it crosses four times, and in places has so many tree
roots it's like walking over vertebrae.</p>
<p>Seven other trails wind through the park, some from the log White Pines
Inn cabins and restaurant, which offers good deals in spring.</p>
<h3>Iowa</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.iowadnr.gov/Destinations/StateParksRecAreas/IowasStateParks/ParkDetails.aspx?ParkID=610105&amp;idAdminBoundary=170">Backbone State
Park</a>
near Strawberry Point</strong> . A path circles
Backbone Lake in this park in the northeast part of the state, on the
edge of the Driftless Area. All kinds of wildflowers grow in the
crevices of limestone outcroppings, on sunny sides of the path and in
hardwood forest on the west side of the lake.</p>
<p>When we were there one Mother's Day, the park was gorgeous but nearly
deserted. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/iowa-state-park-cabins/">A cabin in
Iowa</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/backbone_lake_path.jpg" alt="Backbone lake path." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A path winds around the lake in Iowa's Backbone State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong>Phelps Park in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/decorah-iowa-norwegian-heritage/">Decorah</a></strong>
. Closer to the Mississippi, this town in the bluffs straddles the Upper
Iowa River.</p>
<p>On a hill above downtown, walk the one-mile trail in this park, which
winds along the side of the bluff above the river and is lined with
nifty limestone steps and pillars built by the Civilian Conservation
Corps.</p>
<p>In early spring, it's also a great place to see wild ginger, whose
fuchsia blooms usually hide at the base of the plant. Here, thousands of
them pop out of the rocky hillside, pointing themselves toward the
northern sun.</p>
<p>If you feel like a longer hike, walk on the paved, 11-mile <a href="http://www.troutruntrail.com/">Trout Run
Trail</a>. It loops around town, following
the Upper Iowa to its confluence with Trout Run Creek, where pull-outs
accommodate fishermen.</p>
<p>It also passes the fish hatchery that's home to the famous <a href="https://www.raptorresource.org/birdcams/decorah-eagles/">Decorah
bald eagles</a>,
which raise their eaglets in their 6-foot, 750-pound nest.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.iowadnr.gov/Destinations/StateParksRecAreas/IowasStateParks/ParkDetails.aspx?ParkID=610132&amp;idAdminBoundary=218">Wapsipinicon State
Park</a>
near Anamosa</strong> . The Wapsipinicon River runs through this lovely park
east of Cedar Rapids, at the start of Grant Wood Scenic Byway. Trails
are lined with spring ephemerals and rock cliffs.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/r/traverse_city_trilliums.jpg" alt="Trilliums in Traverse City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Giant trilliums grow along trails behind Grand Traverse Commons in
Traverse City.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Michigan</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.garfield-twp.com/gtcommons.asp">Grand Traverse Commons Natural
Area</a> in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-attractions-traverse-city/">Traverse
City</a></strong> . Behind
the castle-like Village at Grand Commons, a former state mental asylum
that's now full of shops and restaurants, there's a hilly wooded area
lined with trails.</p>
<p>In May, you'll see the region's fattest fat trilliums there, along
with other wildflowers. **
**</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/black-river-michigan/">Black River
waterfalls</a> near
Bessemer</strong> . Five spectacular waterfalls line the last three miles of
the Black River before it flows into Lake Superior. A trail connects
them, part of the North Country National Scenic Trail.</p>
<p>They're not far from Ironwood. To get there, follow County Road 513
from Bessemer on U.S. 2.</p>
