<p>Rah-Rah PR firm hacks poll</p>
<p>The Milwaukee, Wis. public relations firm � Ellingsen Brady Advertising � that created the Rah-Rah Rochester campaign felt it needed some extra help in getting some positive numbers in a Post-Bulletin online poll.</p>
<p>Web users were asked their opinions of �Rah, Rah, Rochester� and whether they thought the slogan was �sassy� or �lame.� Votes in the very unscientific poll was leaning heavily � 90 percent � to &quot;Lame.&quot;</p>
<p>.Photo_kids</p>
<p>Then the vote totals to the Post-Bulletin�s Web site vote on the slogan changed significantly overnight Friday.</p>
<p>Technicians traced 211 votes for the �sassy� vote to the Ellingsen Brady Advertising office's IP address in Milwaukee after the large jump in votes were noted. HHhmmmm�</p>
<p>Actually, they (if it was in fact Ellingsen Brady) did not vote enough to make sassy a winner. The spike in votes put Sassy at 36 percent while Lame is at 63 percent</p>

<p>Words Fail Us, August 2006, Harry Beckwith</p>
<p>The city of Rochester, Minnesota recently joined the unusual number of cities that have discovered branding.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they discovered it without understanding it, as has happened to every city but two. (More on that in a moment.)</p>
<p>ADS:16</p>
<p>On June 20 they announced their new campaign, which is � we kid you not:</p>
<p>Rah Rah Rochester: More Than You Know.</p>
<p>Where to begin? First, the role of marketing communications is not to invite prospects to figure out what makes you special. This common marketing failure is most obvious in one of the world's most common and ineffectual theme lines: &quot;Come discover the (Brand X) difference.&quot; These appalling slogans suggest that the marketers studied the product, couldn't identify its point of difference, and insisted that we come take a look and see if we can.</p>
<p>&quot;More than we know?&quot; Well of course Rochester, Minnesota is more than we know! Every person, place or thing is. If someone knows anything about Rochester, it's that it's the home of the Mayo Clinic, not among the world's more compelling tourist attractions. We also probably can figure out that Rochester, like the rest of the state, is cold. Perhaps this new slogan is suggesting that it's more cold than we know. Or maybe more doctors live there than we thought.</p>
<p>What are they saying?</p>
<p>Hard to say, but what they are revealing is that they suffer an enormous insecurity complex. They really don't think there is much there. If they did, after all, they'd tell us. But hey, come anyway! We're not really proud of our city but it's � well, it's not as bad as you thought.</p>
<p>And Rah Rah Rochester? The agency said they wanted to come up with something sassy. Sassy, however, only works if it's up-to-date. &quot;Rah Rah&quot; sits right across the aisle from &quot;23 Skidoo&quot; and &quot;Sis Boom Bah,&quot; corsets and marching bands. Come to Rochester and see our spittoons!</p>
<p>New York once got it right: they gave us &quot;I Love New York, &quot;which worked in multiple ways. More recently, Las Vegas got it right with &quot;What happens here, stays here&quot; � a trait which has earned that city the lifelong gratitude of several million men who arrive in Las Vegas and are suddenly seized with an immense yearning for the company of hookers. But beyond this tale of those two cities, the landscape of destination branding looks bleak.</p>
<p>How bleak is it? Someone recently compiled a list of the best city slogans. The number-one slogan for any Midwest City � and again we are kidding you not � was this:</p>
<p>Where the eagle soars and the carp drops!</p>
<p>Like some of you, I wondered if a typesetter had accidentally transposed the a and r in carp. That slogan seemed to make more sense, and certainly would get more attention. Then I wondered�if that was number one, what did number ten sound like?</p>
<p>Let's not think about it.</p>

<p>SOMETHING TO CHEER ABOUT FOR ROCHESTER:</p>
<p>MORE VISITORS AND IMPROVED LOCAL PERCEPTIONS</p>
<p>ROCHESTER, MINN. (December 15, 2006) � In June 2006, Rochester witnessed the unveiling of a new logo and tagline: �Rah Rah Rochester � More Than You Know.� Created to spark a sense of energy and spirit, the brand is part of a marketing plan that the Rochester Convention and Visitors Bureau (RCVB) is utilizing to position itself as a destination of choice. The campaign has been a success for RCVB officials, following positive �civic pride� survey results and confirmation of new business for 2007.</p>
<p>The RCVB is using a variety of tactics to reach its goal of attracting new tourism and convention dollars from outside the city and state. The first phase of the campaign focused locally to foster community support, since the public�s role is vitally important to delivering positive experiences to visitors. The RCVB encouraged locals to be enthusiastic and gracious hosts.</p>
<p>Survey Results Positive</p>
<p>Prior to the Rah Rah Rochester campaign launch, RCVB officials commissioned a research project to survey 863 area households about their perceptions regarding elements of the Rochester tourism product. In November, a follow-up survey of 790 households (420 or 53 percent of which were the same households previously surveyed) revealed a 32 percent increase in awareness of the RCVB and the work they do, and 82 percent awareness of the Rah Rah Rochester campaign. Of those aware of the campaign, a majority, 55 percent, said they �like it� and only 28 percent said they �dislike it.�</p>
<p>Asked about their willingness to recommend Rochester to someone they knew, those surveyed were 23 percent more likely to recommend the city for a �getaway� on the second survey. Respondents were 21 percent more likely to recommend the city for a �convention or meeting.� The only reason for recommending Rochester that decreased between the two surveys was �arts and culture.�</p>
<p>Eight percent more people said that Rochester is a �vibrant community� on the second survey, and 16 percent more people had �positive perceptions� than �average perceptions� of Downtown Rochester. Of those surveyed, 85 percent had a �good� or �excellent� overall perception of Rochester.</p>
<p>�Since launching Rah Rah Rochester, we have gotten much feedback, but it�s this survey that really lets us know that civic pride is improving,� said Brad Jones, executive director of the RCVB. �Our goal was to create a community that would support us as we went after new tourism business. I think we�ve been effective.�</p>
<p>So far, 2006 is on track to be Rochester�s best tourism year ever, with a nine percent increase in overall bookings and a more than $20 million increase in direct visitor spending. The RCVB estimates visitor spending will top $270 million this year.</p>
<p>New Business Confirmed for 2007</p>
<p>The new brand, combined with other marketing tactics such as a sales folder, fact sheets, case studies and customized videos have made an impact with local and regional audiences.</p>
<p>�In the last six months, the RCVB was approached by six individuals who came forward with potential future event bookings as a result of the exposure and publicity of the branding campaign,� said Jones. �These six events represent 4,610 room nights and $1.1 million in direct spending into Rochester�s economy. To date, two of these leads have been confirmed for a total of 1,150 room nights and $265,000 in future direct spending.�</p>
<p>Next, the RCVB will unveil a suite of new services, implementing innovative sales tactics, and gearing up to release a targeted direct mail program for January.</p>
<p>�All signs are pointing toward a record 2007, which tells us our marketing efforts are doing exactly what we need � getting people who control the purse strings of major groups and conventions to get excited about us,� said Jones.</p>
<p>The hospitality and tourism industry is the second largest industry in Rochester, following health care. In 2005, tourism contributed $246 million in direct visitor spending to the local economy and provided more than 11,000 full-time equivalent jobs. The city hosts 2.5 million visitors each year, 60 percent of whom come for the famous Mayo Clinic, 18 percent for business, 14 percent for conventions or sports, six percent for leisure, and two percent for other reasons. Visitors to Rochester spend an average of $1.2 million daily.</p>
<p>The Rochester Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau is the official marketing agency for the city of Rochester, responsible for destination sales and marketing efforts. The RCVB works to encourage conventions, meetings, sporting events and business travel to Rochester and provides travel-planning support for the patients of Mayo Clinic. The Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau offers comprehensive information about lodging, dining, special events, activities and local attractions.</p>
