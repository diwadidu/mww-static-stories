<p>If you like to ride bikes and you live in the western Great Lakes,
you've lucked out.</p>
<p>This is a bike-crazy part of the country. Michigan and Minnesota rank
No. 1 and 2 for <a href="http://www.railstotrails.org/our-work/research-and-information/national-and-state-trail-stats/">miles of rails converted to
trails</a>.</p>
<p>Wisconsin pioneered rail trails and for years was the top state, but it
has slipped to fourth place, with No. 3 now taken by Pennsylvania.
Illinois and Iowa once rounded out the Top 6 but have been supplanted by
New York and Washington state.</p>
<p>Wisconsin's Elroy-Sparta State Trail sparked the boom in bicycle
tourism in 1967; when surrounding towns and counties saw all the
tourists who came to ride it, they built their own trails. We also can
ride on thousands of miles of quiet country roads, built so dairy
farmers could get their milk to market.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Now hundreds of bike tours show off the trails and the towns they go
through. Nearly every tour ends with music and a picnic and offers
non-stop goodies at rest stops.</p>
<p>On the Lake Wobegon Trail, the Caramel Roll Ride matches the calories in
a freshly baked pastry to the calories burned in an hour of riding
(&quot;Coincidence? Think again&quot;).</p>
<p>And some towns really take advantage of what they've got. On the Tour
de Pepin, riders who only want to go halfway around Lake Pepin, a wide
spot in the Mississippi, get to return by paddlewheeler.</p>
<p>The main attraction of these tours is not only that they're fun, but
they're easy. Signs mark every turn, sag wagons pick up tired riders
and mechanics fix flats. There's nothing to do but pedal, enjoy the
scenery and chat with fellow riders.</p>
<p>Below are some of the best and most scenic weekend and day tours in
<em>2023.</em></p>

<p>For trails on which you can organize your own trips, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-minnesota/">Bicycling in
Minnesota</a>, <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/biking-wisconsin/">Bicycling in
Wisconsin</a> and other <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/">Bicycling
stories</a>.</p>
<p>Sign up early to save. Most rides allow same-day registration, but some
rides cut off registration a month or more in advance.</p>
<p>Most day tours charge $50-$80, which includes sag wagons, mechanical
support, food and, often, a T-shirt. Weekend tours include camping and
return by motorcoach.</p>
<p>They're all non-profit, and most raise money for good causes. Fees
nearly always are discounted for advance registrations and for families,
children and teams.</p>
<p>Some rides limit the number of riders, and some benefit rides require
fund-raising. Helmets are required.</p>
