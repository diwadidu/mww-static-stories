<h2>In the top rail-trails state, everyone loves a ride along Lake Michigan.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/i/little_traverse_wheelway.jpg" alt="Bicycling on the Little Traverse Wheelway." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The trail between Charlevoix and Petoskey mostly is sheltered.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The more I travel through the beach towns of west Michigan, the more I
want to see.</p>
<p>So I've slowed down and started touring by the seat of my pants-on
a bicycle.</p>
<p>Michigan makes that easy with 2,385 miles of <a href="http://www.railstotrails.org/ourWork/trailBasics/trailStats.html">rail
trails</a>, more than any other state. You can catch a trail all along the Lake
Michigan shore, from Traverse City to South Haven.</p>
<p>So when I found myself in Petoskey on a gorgeous spring day, I rented a
bike to ride the Little Traverse Wheelway. And sure enough, I saw a
whole lot more than I ever did in a car.</p>
<p>From Latitude 45 bike shop, I rode a block to the lakeshore, where the
trails cut around the wooden Solanus Indian Mission Church, founded by
Father Baraga in 1859.</p>
<p>An older couple were riding the trail, and as I took their photo, the
woman called, &quot;You can caption that 'Honeymooners on bikes!' &quot;</p>
<p>With its enviable spot on Little Traverse Bay, Petoskey has been a
tourist draw nearly since it was founded.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The first wheelway predated the railroad and was used in the 1880s by
the first bicyclists, who rode around the bay to Harbor Springs. Three
arches are replicas of a gate that warned horse owners that &quot;No Teaming
or Driving&quot; was allowed.</p>
<p>I rode south, through the city's Magnus Park to Bay Harbor, which had
been puzzling me since I saw it on our first <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-circle-tour/">Circle Tour of Lake
Michigan</a>.</p>
<p>This manufactured community of big Victorian manors anchored by two
giant Victorian hotels seems a little eerie, perhaps because there are
so many buildings and so few people.</p>
<p>As I rode through this Disneyland for the yachting class-there's a
yacht shop and Sotheby's in the newest hotel-it was just me, the
landscapers and the security guards.</p>
<p>Back on the bluff, I rode on to West Park, which, like Bay Harbor, was
created on land once occupied by a cement plant. A trail led through
forest toward a beach reputed to be a source of Petoskey stones, chunks
of fossilized coral that are the state stone.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/e/petoskey_honeymooners.jpg" alt="Bicycling on the Little Traverse Wheelway." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I was looking for morel mushrooms, but found only trilliums and clumps
of yellow trout lilies.</p>
<p>On the way back, I passed many gated lanes and saw where the rich keep
their toys: at Bay Harbor Toy Boxes, of course, &quot;storage built to
suit.&quot; The Dermatology Associates of Northern Michigan had built
offices across the highway, which seemed convenient: Get a face lift,
then recover at your lake place.</p>
<p>Soon I was riding past the art-deco city hall and a picture-perfect
falls on the rushing Bear River. Petoskey is nothing if not perfect,
with its historic Gaslight District full of mercantiles, haberdasheries
and general stores, plus a white gazebo and big yellow Victorian hotel
on the bluff.</p>
<p>Back on the lake in Bayfront Park, I passed a daintier falls and Kiln
Pond. Soon I was in Bay View, a neighborhood founded in 1875 as a summer
colony for Methodists.</p>
<p>It's full of real Victorians, one with a real sense of humor: It
proclaimed itself the &quot;Tilt-N-Hilton.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>After a shady and quiet stretch, the trail rejoined the highway, passing
Petoskey Brewing, &quot;Est. 1898, Revived 2012.&quot;</p>
<p>From there, I rode into Petoskey State Park, arriving at a beach lined
with tall dunes, then continued along the highway and into a nature
preserve.</p>
<p>But the vehicle noise was unbearable, and I turned back. I stopped at
the '50s-style Bob-In Again for a frozen-custard cone and was heading
on when I saw a &quot;Chocolate Tours&quot; sign and swerved back.</p>
<p>It was for the Kilwins Chocolate Kitchen, where a friendly guy gave me a
big chunk of raspberry-chocolate fudge and told me there was more where
that came from on free tours given on the hour, every half-hour in
summer.</p>
<p>I'd whiled away the whole afternoon. Back at the bike shop, I tried to
pay for the extra time I'd had the bike, but employee Heidi Snell told
me not to worry about it.</p>
<p>She and her husband, Jason, also told me how I could have bypassed the
highway and ridden to Harbor Springs on quiet lanes close to the lake:
At Menonaqua Woods, where I had turned back, turn instead onto Powell
Road.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/e/petoskey_perry_hotel.jpg" alt="Stafford's Perry Hotel in Petoskey." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Petoskey, the 1899 Stafford's Perry Hotel overlooks Lake Michigan.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>That turns into Beach Road, which takes bicyclists right into the
old-money enclave of the Wequetonsing Association, a summer colony
founded in 1880, then downtown Harbor Springs.</p>
<p>I tried the route in my car as I headed north. Of course, it was
perfect.</p>
