<p>The can-do spirit of the 19th century can be felt everywhere along a
19½-mile stretch of the Chippewa River.</p>
<p>Jean Brunet built his own dam and sawmill in 1836 and piloted his first
raft of lumber to Prairie du Chien himself. Jacob Leinenkugel arrived in
1867 and founded the Spring Brewery.</p>
<p>Ezra Cornell bought up logging and mineral rights in the area, which
became the logging center of the world in the 1880s, although the
profits went to Ithaca, N.Y., where he'd founded Cornell University.</p>
<p>But a bald eagle was the feistiest of them all. Old Abe was traded to a
local farmer by a band of Chippewa in 1861 and sent into the Civil War
as a mascot for the Eighth Wisconsin. He served in 42 battles, where he
was said to have spread his wings and screamed in support of the troops,
more fiercely as the fighting escalated.</p>
<p>After the war, Abe received his own room and caretaker at the State
Capitol and continued to serve the state: One of his last appearances
before his 1881 death was alongside former President U.S. Grant, at a
convention of the Grand Army of the Republic.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When a paved bicycle trail opened along this historic stretch, it had to
be named for Old Abe. A century ago, the river was lined by nasty rapids
and falls that killed off log-straddling lumberjacks by the dozen.</p>
<p>But after the white pine was logged off and milled, a series of
hydroelectric dams was built; one of the dams, in 1917, created
6,300-acre Lake Wissota.</p>
<p>Today, this section of the Chippewa River is placid, with small
factories chugging along in quiet towns: the paper mill in Cornell, the
cheese plant in Jim Falls, the brewery in Chippewa Falls.</p>
<p>Nothing says Wisconsin more than beer, cheese and paper.</p>
<p>Bicyclists and in-line skaters along this beautiful trail, however, will
notice much more-deer, wild turkey, fox and the occasional coyote
and bald eagle. Birds frequent the cattail marshes along the trail near
Jim Falls.</p>

Trail.

<p>When I was there, I spotted a blue heron and also a least bittern, a
reclusive heron with rich tawny coloring.</p>
<p>From the north, bicyclists can start either in Brunet Island State Park,
from which the trail winds through a corridor of red pine, or from
Cornell's Mill Yard Park.</p>
<p>The park is hard to miss; above it looms a 175-foot-tall pulpwood
stacker, a 1912 conveyor that's the only one of its kind. In the
visitors center under it, old pictures show how the stacker piled logs
into pyramids that then were floated to the mill.</p>
<p>From Cornell-first called Brunet Falls, a name to which some
residents would like to revert-the trail winds to Cobban past a 1906
steel truss bridge, still in use, and a 1913 general store and tavern
that catered to ferry and rail traffic.</p>
<p>After Cobban, the trail hugs the river, which widens into Old Abe Lake;
the McCann farmstead, where Old Abe was raised, is on the other side.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>These five miles are the prettiest part of the trail, with marshes on
one side and the lake on the other, including a little wooded peninsula
that's perfect for picnics.</p>
<p>From Jim Falls, named for one of the area's last fur traders, the trail
continues along the river and dives into farmland.</p>
<p>From the southern trailhead north of Chippewa Falls, County Road O leads
into Lake Wissota State Park, in which teen-age girls everywhere
suddenly were interested after the lake was named in &quot;Titanic&quot; as Jack
Dawson's favorite spot.</p>
<p>The lake didn't exist when the Titanic sank, but today, visitors swim
along a 300-foot beach and fish off a 25-foot pier.</p>
<p>City trails lead into Chippewa Falls. Eventually, the Old Abe will
connect to the Chippewa River Trail out of Eau Claire and the Red Cedar
between Menomonie and Dunnville, creating a 70-mile trail shaped like a
check mark.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Old Abe State Trail in western Wisconsin</h3>
<p><em>Bicycling</em> : The paved <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/oldabe/">Old Abe State
Trail</a> runs 20 miles along
the Chippewa River between Chippewa Falls and Cornell, with a one-mile
city trail leading into Brunet Island State Park from Cornell.</p>
<p>The southern trailhead is north of Chippewa Falls at the junction of
county roads O and S, two miles west of Lake Wissota State Park.</p>
<p>A signed five-mile loop, partly on streets and sidewalks, connects
downtown Chippewa Falls to the bicycle trail, following Duncan Creek
through wooded Pig Alley to the Leinie Lodge on the west and Timber
Terrace Golf Course on the east.</p>
<p>Get a map from the Visitor Center at the intersection of River and
Bridge Street; to get to the trailhead, follow Spring Street across the
Marsh Rainbow Arch Bridge.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.springstreetsports.com">Spring Street Sports</a> at 12 W.
Spring Street also has information about routes, 715-723-6616.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/admission/trailpass">Wisconsin state-trail
pass</a> is
required, $5 daily and $25 annual.</p>
<p><em>Camping</em> : There's camping on both ends of the trail, in <a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/lakewissota">Lake Wissota
State Park</a> and
<a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/brunetisland">Brunet Island State
Park</a>.</p>
