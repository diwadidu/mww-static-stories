<h2>In southeast Minnesota, tiny Lanesboro pulls in the tourists.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanesboro_winter2.jpg" alt="Winter in Lanesboro." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Lanesboro</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In winter, snow coats the bluffs around town.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In an isolated bluff-country valley, reached only by small, winding
roads, lies one of Minnesota's favorite getaways.</p>
<p>There are no condo resorts here, no wine bars and — heaven forbid —
no national franchises. The aroma of manure hangs over downtown on
Wednesdays and Fridays, when livestock auctions are held.</p>
<p>Only 750 people live here, and they can't afford to advertise much, so
most visitors come via word of mouth.</p>
<p>Even so, Lanesboro is the town every other small town in the region
wishes it could be.</p>
<p>For Lanesboro is right on the proverbial street paved with gold. The
beautiful Root River State Trail goes through town, following the
looping river and crossing it on dozens of wooden bridges.</p>
<p>A professional theater company stages plays nine months a year. Dozens
of artists work here; many sell their art at a cooperative gallery. B&amp;Bs
occupy lovely Victorian houses, and shops fill the century-old brick
storefronts.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Lanesboro, surrounded by tall limestone bluffs, always has been
picturesque. In the late 1860s, its four-story Phoenix Hotel was the
largest hotel west of the Mississippi, thanks to land speculators who
envisioned a spa on the site.</p>
<p>But the hotel burned, and the town turned to agriculture.</p>
<p>By the 1970s, it had fallen asleep. The last train had gone through, and
the movie theater had closed. Downtown storefronts were used as grain
silos. Lanesboro, with no county seat and no major highway, was the
center of nothing.</p>
<p>Then, a miracle happened. During the 1980s, the paved trail was created
along the old rail bed, and throngs of bicyclists began to show up.</p>
<p>A native son returned and opened the Commonweal Theatre, first using the
old St. Mane movie house and now a $3.5 million building with two
auditoriums.</p>
<p>An artists' collective took over an 1879 general store and turned it
into the Lanesboro Arts Center, covering its high walls with paintings
and placing sculptures on its sturdy floors.</p>
<p>Festivals were started: In June, Rhubarb Festival and Art in the Park,
and in August, Buffalo Bill Days, celebrating when Buffalo Bill Cody
brought his Wild West Show to town in 1900, performing with his friend
Frank &quot;White Beaver&quot; Powell, a La Crosse pharmacist.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanesboro_museum_bicyclists_horizontal.jpg" alt="Bicyclists gather in downtown Lanesboro." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Today, Lanesboro is the recreational and cultural capital of southeast
Minnesota.</p>
<p>We go there often, for the wildflowers and morels in spring, bicycling
in summer and fall and cross-country skiing in winter.</p>
<p>There's always something going on at night, too: plays at the
Commonweal, and often music and dancing at the Sons of Norway hall, a
homey nook near Sylvan Park.</p>
<p>Four miles west of town, touring musicians perform in the 250-seat
auditorium at Eagle Bluff Environmental Learning Center.</p>
<p>On gray days, tourists take shorter bike rides, then hit the shops on
Parkway Avenue. They sell housewares, antiques, jewelry, imported
clothing and gifts, and if you're lucky, you can find locally made
Amish cashew crunch at Amish Experience.</p>
<p>Another local delicacy is Spring Grove soda, in lemon sour, strawberry,
black cherry, orange, grape, root beer and cream. You can buy ice-cold
bottles of it, along with locally grown cheese, meat, eggs and produce.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's no question that downtown Lanesboro is a very nice place to be.
But, as busy as its streets are, most people take themselves elsewhere,
for Lanesboro is just ground zero for explorers.</p>
<p>From it, bicyclists head 31 miles east to Houston or 11 miles west to
Fountain, a mostly uphill stretch. But another trail begins 4½ miles
west of Lanesboro.</p>
<p>At Isinours Junction, cyclists can turn south onto the Harmony-Preston
Valley State Trail, riding 5½ miles into Preston; this shaded stretch,
along the South Branch of the Root River, is one of the prettiest of the
whole system.</p>
<p>From Preston, it's 12 miles to Harmony, some of it on an 8 percent
grade. The first part follows a creek, and the last half is through farm
fields.</p>
<p>Canoeists frequent the Root River, and trout fishermen cast their lines
from the shady banks of the many creeks. The hills are the domain of
turkey hunters and, in early May, of those who stalk the marvelous morel
mushroom.</p>
<p>Tour operators take curious visitors to see the Amish at their farms in
the nearby ridges and valleys and to shop at their stores.</p>
<p>Today, people from all over the nation and world visit Lanesboro, a fact
that still amazes the townsfolk. For a while, some of the old-timers
were a little peeved they could no longer get &quot;their&quot; parking space
when they go downtown.</p>

<p>But for everyone else, it's a sacrifice they're willing to bear.</p>
