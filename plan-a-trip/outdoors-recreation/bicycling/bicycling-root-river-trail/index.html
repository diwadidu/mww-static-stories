<h2>In southeast Minnesota, the Root River Trail brings swarms of tourists to scenic villages.</h2>

<p>It was a sunny day in southeastern Minnesota, and everywhere I looked,
there were Babes.</p>
<p>Babes bombing along bike trails, Babes prowling the shops of Lanesboro,
Babes laughing over white wine in the inn where I was staying.</p>
<p>They were the Fat Bottom Girls Cycle Club from Des Moines, also known as
Babes on Bikes, and they were having a swell time riding the smooth,
scenic trails of the Root River Valley.</p>
<p>I took a group photo of them in front of the Jailhouse Inn in Preston
and inquired about their name; I didn't, ahem, see a fat bottom
anywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;It's from the Queen song, 'Fat-bottom girls make the rockin' world go
'round,&quot; said one of the Babes. &quot;Then the lyrics go, 'Get on your
bike and ride.' &quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Bicyclists come from all over the region to ride the trails of
Minnesota's bluff country, and inns are packed in summer and on fall
weekends.</p>
<p>It's a big change from the late 1970s, when the area was known mainly
to trout fishermen and turkey hunters. The last train had gone through
Lanesboro and the movie theater had closed. In nearby Harmony, the Amish
had yet to arrive.</p>
<p>The paving of a bicycle trail along the Root River changed everything in
the 1980s.</p>
<p>Bicyclists love the river views, the 48 wooden bridges, the canopy of
trees, even the occasional rattlesnake sunning itself on the blacktop of
the Root River State Trail.</p>
<p>And they love the tucked-away feeling of Lanesboro, a hamlet framed by
limestone bluffs.</p>
<p>Lanesboro's picturesque isolation became a good thing. Quaint
bed-and-breakfasts opened, a theater company moved into the movie house
and shops began to fill the century-old brick storefronts, some of which
had been used to store grain.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Towns all over Minnesota looked on and asked, &quot;Why not us?&quot;</p>
<p>Preston and Harmony, with a tourism industry based on the local caves
and Amish tours, were among them.</p>
<p>The 18-mile Harmony-Preston Valley State Trail came next, connecting to
the Root River trail at Isinours Junction, midway between Fountain and
Lanesboro.</p>
<p>The 5½ miles from Isinours to Preston follows the bends of the Root
River's South Branch and is one of the sweetest stretches of trail in
Minnesota, sometimes passing pockets of tilled land, sometimes bluffs
with wildflowers growing out of crannies.</p>
<p>From Preston, bicyclists have to work a little harder. The trail heads
up to Harmony along Camp Creek, a favorite fishing spot; Preston calls
itself the trout capital of southern Minnesota.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The trail goes on, shaded by limestone bluffs, then starts to climb at
an 8 percent grade, emerging onto farm fields redolent with fresh
manure.</p>
<p>In Harmony, the trail ends at the Village Depot, where the Amish often
sell jams, pickles, eggs and homemade baskets and rugs out of their
horse-drawn buggies.</p>
<p>The downhill ride back, of course, is a lot more fun.</p>
<p>There are more hills on the easternmost stretch of the Root River State
Trail, which now stretches 42 miles between Fountain and Houston.</p>
<p>Far fewer bicyclists ride the 12½-mile section between Rushford and
Houston, but it's the most exhilarating on the trail, a glide from
Houston's Nature Center down to the river and into terrain that marks
the beginning of coulee country.</p>

<p>It doesn't use an old rail corridor, and it's definitely not flat.</p>
<p>Since the Root River State Trail was created, Minnesota has created many
great trails.</p>
<p>But to many people in the state and around the region, it's still the
bicyclists' Champs Elysees.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/blufflands/root_river.html">Root River State
Trail</a>
: This 42-mile trail, in lovely bluff country between Fountain and
Houston, is Minnesota's pride and joy.</p>
<p>There's a 6½-mile downhill from Fountain to Isinours Junction (if
you're arriving via U.S. 52, have your bicycling partners drop you off
in Fountain so you can enjoy it), from which the trail follows the Root
River, crossing dozens of bridges as it goes through Lanesboro, Whalan,
Peterson and Rushford.</p>
<p>From Rushford, the trail departs from abandoned rail line and becomes
especially scenic, climbing a steep hill on its way to Houston, where
the Houston Nature Center offers showers.</p>
<p>Much of it is shady, and the area's lack of standing water means there
are few mosquitoes.</p>

country</a>.</p>
<p>For places to stay, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/bed-breakfast/lanesboro-BBs-inns/">Lodgings in
Lanesboro</a>. Reserve early
in summer and for fall weekends.</p>

byways</a>.</p>
<p>If there's enough snow in winter, there's skiing on the trail (away
from towns, where it tends to get trampled), and the area is much
quieter.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/blufflands/harmony_preston.html">Harmony-Preston Valley State
Trail</a>
: From Isinours Junction, 4½ miles west of Lanesboro on the Root River
State Trail, this 18-mile trail goes through Preston and up to the farm
town of Harmony.</p>
<p>The 5½ miles to Preston, which follow the South Branch of the Root
River, are shady and among the prettiest of the whole system. In the
winter, it's an excellent place to ski.</p>
<p>The last third of the trail, up to Harmony, is more open and on an 8
percent grade (outfitters will take bicyclists up to Harmony for a
downhill ride).</p>
<p>On busy weekends, it's often easier to find a place to stay in Preston
than in Lanesboro.</p>
<p>Lodgings in Preston include the <a href="http://www.jailhouseinn.com/">Jailhouse Historic
Inn</a> in town; <a href="http://www.countrytrailsinn.com/">Country Trails Inn &amp;
Suites</a> on U.S. 52; and <a href="http://www.trailheadinnpreston.com/">Trail Head
Inn</a> on the trail.</p>
