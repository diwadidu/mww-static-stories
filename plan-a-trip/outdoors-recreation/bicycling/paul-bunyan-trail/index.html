<h2>A long, paved trail cuts through the heart of Minnesota lakes country.</h2>

Bicyclists ride the trail through downtown Nisswa.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's as wide as seven axhandles and a plug of tobacco, and as smooth as
a flapjack griddle.</p>
<p>It unfurls over a landscape dotted with lakes created, according to
north-woods legend, by the tracks of a giant lumberjack and his faithful
blue ox.</p>
<p>It's the Paul Bunyan State Trail, and it links Minnesota's main
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadside-attractions/paul-bunyan-minnesota/">Bunyan shrines</a>.</p>
<p>Hackensack is home to the buxom, 17-foot Lucette Diana Kensack, billed
as Paul's sweetheart until a &quot;marriage certificate&quot; was found by
town boosters. In Bemidji, a stern 18-foot Paul started the colossus fad
in 1937.</p>
<p>A 25-foot kneeling Paul is in Akeley, three miles west on the nearby
Heartland Trail, which meets the Bunyan along Minnesota 34.</p>
<p>It's the longest paved rail trail in the nation, and the
seventh-longest overall.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's also a gorgeous trail to ride on. The Bunyan stretches 121 miles,
from just north of the spot where the Mississippi goes through <em>Bemidji</em>
to the Mississippi River in <em>Crow Wing State Park</em> , south of Brainerd.</p>
<p>The first 7½ miles from Lake Bemidji State Park are a beauty, hugging
the eastern shore of Lake Bemidji and crossing the Mississippi River as
it heads east.</p>
<p>From Bemidji, bicyclists ride a quiet, forested stretch of trail to
<em>Walker</em> , where the Bunyan heads west toward Akeley, sharing the
Heartland State Trail.</p>
<p>From a parking lot/trailhead on Minnesota 34, the Bunyan turns south,
plunging into Chippewa National Forest on a nine-mile up-and-down
stretch that local bicyclists call &quot;the Pyrenees.&quot;</p>
<p>I rode it once on an organized bike tour and was just behind a rider who
took one of its hairpin turns too fast, went flying off the trail into a
tree and had to be air-lifted to a hospital in Fargo.</p>
<p>The next time I rode it, I kept my hand on my brakes.</p>

On the south end of Lake Bemidji, bicyclists can see the original
Bunyan.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Looking for beaches</h3>
<p>One August, I kept riding south through <em>Hackensack</em> , which has a small
downtown that's missed by anyone zooming through on Minnesota 371.</p>
<p>In Hackensack, that's a shame: There's a small beach and a fishing
pier on Birch Lake, a playground and, of course, the voluptuous Lucette,
Paul's sweetheart/wife.</p>
<p>In late summer, the trail was thick with wildflowers: prairie thistle,
gayfeather, the vivid yellows of tansy and goldenrod. On a nearby
meadow, a farmer was baling hay; ahead, an in-line skater approached
with the wind at his back and a blissful look on his face.</p>
<p>Cattails announced the wetlands around Beuber Lake, and the scent of
raspberries wafted into my nostrils. Bushes were laden with ripe
berries, so I popped a handful into my mouth before continuing on the
sumac-lined stretch to <em>Backus</em> .</p>
<p>There was another beach in Backus, in a small city park on Pine Mountain
Lake, a block west of the town's old brick storefronts.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From Backus, the stretch to <em>Pine River</em> is the trail's least
attractive; it follows the highway and is unshaded, making it hot on a
summer day.</p>
<p>So in Pine River, I rode through town to a little sand-bottom swimming
area on the river, next to a grove of red pines with a Lincoln Log
pavilion. Pine River has a flourishing main street that includes a
bakery and cafes.</p>
<p>The trail continues along the highway until three miles north of <em>Pequot
Lakes</em> , where it ducks behind sheltering trees.</p>
<p>Pequot, famous for its fishing-bobber water tower, is split into two
downtowns: the old-fashioned side, where the locals shop, and the
tourist side of boutiques and galleries.</p>
<p>The stretch south to <em>Nisswa</em> is peaceful, though busier, and sometimes
I could hear the highway on the other side of the trees. East Twin Lake
appeared on my left, blue and inviting, then Lower Cullen Lake.</p>
<p>I could see a beach on its far side, but none along the trail; as it
turns out, there are no public swimming areas near the trail after Pine
River.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/a/hackensack_bunyan_trail_skaters.jpg" alt="Skaters on the Bunyan Trail in Hackensack." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Skaters use the trail in Hackensack, home of Paul Bunyan's
"sweetheart."
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then I passed a shady city park and emerged into downtown Nisswa, which
was in the middle of a Crazy Days sidewalk sale. I looked around the
little town in the middle of the woods-no houses, just a collection
of shops shops.</p>
<p>I didn't begrudge Nisswa its milling mob; in winter, most of the shops
have to go into hibernation.</p>
<p>And even above the hubbub, I could hear the trill of a loon. Heading
south away from the highway, I rode deep into the heart of lake country,
where I got a rare glimpse at the maze of roads between the tiny
mom-and-pop resorts that still draw people back year after year.</p>
<p>It was early evening, and the crickets were making a racket. I rode
through grassy fields occupied only by power lines, then past Mollie and
North Long lakes and the Train Bell Resort in Merrifield.</p>
<p>The stretch into <em>Baxter-Brainerd</em> was a corridor of green, with the
trail sandwiched between a golf course and Northland Arboretum.</p>
<p>And now the trail crosses a bridge over Minnesota 210 and heads six
miles south to <em>Crow Wing State Park</em> , next to the Mississippi River
and just off Minnesota 371.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Bicycling the Bunyan</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/paul_bunyan/index.html">Paul Bunyan State
Trail</a> :
From the south, you can start in <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/crow_wing/index.html">Crow Wing State
Park</a> or in
Baxter at Northland Arboretum, along Excelsior Road just off Minnesota
371. The 15 miles from Baxter to Nisswa is flat, straight and quiet.</p>
<p>After Nisswa, the trail follows 371, separated by trees, until three
miles north of Pequot Lakes, where it loses its tree cover until Backus.</p>
<p>The seven miles from Backus to Hackensack and the nine up-and-down miles
through national forest, nicknamed the Pyrenees, are the most scenic.</p>
<p>It meets the Heartland Trail on the north side of Minnesota 34, 2½ miles
east of Akeley. It shares the next 7¾ miles to Walker, through woods and
bogs, with the Heartland State Trail.</p>
<p>On the west side of Walker, the trail goes under Minnesota 371, to a
short spur that deposits bicyclists in downtown Walker, a stone's throw
from the municipal pier on Leech Lake. On the other side of downtown,
there's a sand beach in City Park.</p>
<p>From Walker, it heads northwest, paralleling Minnesota 200 to Laporte,
where it passes Garfield Lake and then heads into forest to Guthrie and
Nary.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/bemidji_river_bridge.jpg" alt="Bicyclists on the Paul Bunyan Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At the northern end of the trail, bicyclists cross the point at which
the Mississippi River heads east from Lake Bemidji.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the southern edge of Bemidji, bicyclists must ride city streets to
connect with the trail on the southern edge of Lake Bemidji. From there,
it's 7½ miles along the east side of the lake to <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/lake_bemidji/index.html">Lake Bemidji State
Park</a>.</p>
<p>Bicyclists can keep riding around the lake on another 10 miles of city
streets and sidewalks, a very pleasant loop goes past the downtown,
through the university and to city parks and beaches.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/bemidji-bicycling/">Bicycling around Lake
Bemidji</a>.</p>
<p><em>Bunyan-Heartland-Migizi trail system</em> : Add in the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/heartland/index.html">Heartland State
Trail</a>
between Park Rapids and Cass Lake and the Migizi Trail around Cass Lake,
bicyclists have 170 miles of paved, off-road bicycle trail, except for
city streets in Bemidji and Cass Lake.</p>

area</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dining</em> : There are cafes and a pizza place in Nisswa. Just south of
Pine River, <a href="http://bitesgrill.com/">Bites Grill &amp; Bar</a> is right on the
trail.</p>
<p><em>When to go</em> : For vacation atmosphere, go in summer. For a quiet ride
with great color, go in late September or early October.</p>
