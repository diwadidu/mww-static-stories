<h2>In central Minnesota, cyclists enter a storied land.</h2>

<p>To a bicyclist setting out on the Lake Wobegon Trail, there are few
signs that this is a storied landscape.</p>
<p>There's a lake surrounded by cattails and frequented by fishermen and
canoeists. There's another lake across the road, where teen-agers flirt
and toddlers play in the sand.</p>
<p>Down the trail, a clump of showy lady slippers pops out of the weeds. A
great blue heron rises from a slough with languid flaps. A painted
turtle scrapes at the dirt next to the trail, making a nest for its
eggs.</p>
<p>It's just a typical Minnesota landscape — but it made deep impressions
on two young men who later immortalized it.</p>
<p>Harry Lewis grew up there but had little affection for his hometown till
much later, after his 1920 novel &quot;Main Street&quot; made it a national
symbol of small-minded provincialism.</p>
<p>Garrison Keillor — or Gary, until, like Harry, he recast his mold —
moved there in 1970.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>He steeped himself in the idiosyncrasies of Stearns County life until
its characters sprang to life on the public-radio airwaves as citizens
of Lake Wobegon, the mythical town where &quot;the women are strong, the men
are good-looking and the children are above average.&quot;</p>
<p>Though Keillor gave his blessing when the 35-mile bike trail was named,
he didn't quite admit it was Wobegon until he returned to it and wrote
&quot;In Search of Lake Wobegon&quot; for National Geographic magazine, the basis
for a 2001 coffee-table book of the same name.</p>
<p>If they look, bicyclists can find Lake Wobegon in these towns and
perhaps a bit of Sinclair Lewis' Gopher Prairie, too. But it may be best
to take the trail on its own merits.</p>
<p>When a friend and I rode it one June, we got our first inkling that this
was no ordinary trail when we came across those pink and white lady
slippers.</p>
<p>It was the most I'd ever seen and may ever see — the showy lady
slipper, an orchid that needs a tiny fungus to propagate and takes 10 to
20 years to bloom, now is rare in Minnesota, though it's the state
flower.</p>
<p>Then we saw a big old snapping turtle, its back as rough as half-melted
blacktop and its long claws hinting of malice. We rode on past marshes,
reeds swaying in the breeze. It was a sunny Saturday, but we saw only a
few other bicyclists and skaters.</p>

<p>In Albany, we saw the first of the trail's distinctive churches, the
red-brick Seven Dolors, with its clock tower and, next door, well-tended
cemetery with Stations of the Cross. In front, teen-age boys in tuxedos
were hanging around a pickup, waiting for the afternoon wedding.</p>
<p>This area is solidly German Catholic; Keillor had to add Norwegian
Lutherans, he wrote, &quot;for dramatic interest.&quot;</p>
<p>Riding on to Freeport, we were alongside I-94, which gave us the odd
feeling that we were part of the hordes heading to the lakes, but in
slow motion.</p>
<p>Freeport is bona-fide Wobegon country — the Pioneer Inn was the model
for the Sidetrack Tap, and Charlie's Cafe for the Chatterbox — but we
had a feeling things have changed a little in three decades; for one
thing, there are tourists now.</p>
<p>Things had changed less down at the Romanesque yellow-brick Sacred
Heart., watching as bridesmaids and flower girls in white satin stood at
the door, waiting to begin a wedding procession. Our Lady of Perpetual
Responsibility? Maybe.</p>
<p>The freeway faded into the distance on the stretch to Melrose, where we
were able to walk inside the Bavarian-baroque St. Mary's, which has four
onion domes and a vaulted sky-blue ceiling edged in gold.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Across the street, the Jennie-O turkey plant has brought a little of the
outside world into quiet Melrose, where the only people stirring seemed
to be the fishermen below the mill-pond dam.</p>
<p>The trail crosses the Sauk River several times on its way to Sauk
Centre, where Harry Sinclair Lewis, the son of a stern country doctor,
was born in 1895 and grew up before leaving for Yale and New York.</p>
<p>His withering portrayals in &quot;Main Street&quot; infuriated townsfolk, but
they've since forgiven him and celebrate Sinclair Lewis Days every July,
as well as operate the Sinclair Lewis Interpretive Center just off the
highway.</p>
<p>Lewis asked to be buried in the town, and in 1931, a year after he
became the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature, he said
of Sauk Centre, &quot;It was a good time, a good place and a good preparation
for life.&quot;</p>
<p>Oddly, says Juleen Trisko-Schneider, a native and occasional guide at
the Boyhood Home of Sinclair Lewis, the smug chauvinism Lewis so
effectively lampooned pops up now mainly in tourists.</p>
<p>&quot;The only time I get tired of it is when they come in with attitude:
'Oh, these are the poor ignorant hicks,' &quot; she said. &quot;I've had people
say, 'Oh, can you imagine someone from here went to Yale?' I just say,
'Tell me when you want some information.' &quot;</p>

<p>As we rode back, the weddings had ended and the churches were starting
to celebrate Mass. In Avon, we celebrated our day of bicycling by
jumping into Middle Spunk Lake and swimming to the raft.</p>
<p>A Saturday-evening crowd had started to congregate outside Fisher's, an
old-fashioned bottle club on the edge of the beach, lined with windows
to let in the breeze.</p>
<p>We went in and sat at the bar, watching children scamper around the wood
floor and waitresses bring set-ups to chattering tables of 10. A man
named Junior presided behind the bar, the son of ballplayer George
Fisher, who returned home from the major leagues in 1935 and bought this
place.</p>
<p>Junior seemed to know everyone; in fact, everyone seemed to know
everyone.</p>
<p>Of all the places along the trail, this felt most Wobegonic. In fact, it
felt like home — not mine, but definitely someone's; not even a
Sinclair Lewis or Garrison Keillor could be truly lonely here.</p>
<p>I thought of something Juleen Trisko-Schneider had said about small
towns, back in Sauk Centre.</p>
<p>&quot;I think in any place, you need to get away for a while,&quot; she said.
&quot;Then you can come back.&quot;</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: <a href="http://lakewobegontrail.com/">Lake Wobegon Trail</a></h3>
<p><em>The trail</em> : It's 35 miles between St. Joseph (just off I-94, west of
St. Cloud) and Sauk Centre. In St. Joseph, the trailhead is next to the
water tower. Bicyclists coming from St. Cloud now can get onto the trail
in Rivers Edge Park in Waite Park, where a three-mile section of new
trail connects to St. Joseph.</p>
<p>Avon, eight miles west of St. Joseph, also is a good place to start, and
the city beach on Middle Spunk Lake is a good place to take a dip after
biking.</p>
<p>In the middle of the trail, there's a 9½-mile spur from Albany to
Holdingford, and from there the trail heads 13½ miles north and across
the Mississippi River to U.S. 10, where it connects to the gravel Soo
Line Trail north of Royalton.</p>
<p>In Sauk Centre, the Lake Wobegon Trail connects to the 55-mile Central
Lakes Trail, which heads west to Osakis, Alexandria and Fergus Falls.</p>

<p><a href="https://lakewobegontrail.com/lwta-rides/"><strong>Trail events</strong></a> : The
annual Caramel Roll Ride is held the second Saturday in June, the Lady
Slipper Nature Ride the third Saturday in June and the Caramel Apple
Ride the first Saturday after Labor Day.</p>
<p><em>Town events</em> : In <a href="http://www.saukcentrechamber.com/">Sauk Centre</a>,
Sinclair Lewis Days is the second full week of July.</p>
<p><em>Dining</em> : <a href="http://www.fishersclub.com/">Fisher's Club</a> restaurant,
which overlooks Middle Spunk Lake in Avon, still serves walleye dinners
but now has a full-service bar and offers live music.</p>
