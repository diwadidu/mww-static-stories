<p>When people think of bicycling in Wisconsin, the famous Elroy-Sparta
State Trail often is first to pop into their minds. But the state has
added many, many trails since the Elroy-Sparta debuted in 1967, and
it's time to try them.</p>
<p>All of the trails listed below use finely crushed limestone, except as
noted. They're suitable for touring bikes, though a wider tire is best.
Chip-sealed trails are like asphalt but softer, and can be nearly as
smooth because they don't become pitted.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/trailpass.html">State trail passes</a> are
$5 daily, $25 annual; passes also are good in winter on ski trails.
Rates on county and city trails vary; many are free, including the
Interurban and Oak Leaf.</p>
<p>For more information on state trails, check the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/findapark.html">Wisconsin DNR parks and
trails map</a>.</p>
<p>For user reviews of trails, check the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy's
<a href="http://www.traillink.com/">TrailLink</a> site.</p>
<p>Before you go, <em>always check websites for closures</em> due to flooding or
construction.</p>
