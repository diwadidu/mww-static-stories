<h2>On the breathtaking Grand Rounds, bicyclists soak up the scenery.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_lake_harriet_walkers.jpg" alt="People walk around Lake Harriet." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicycle and walking trails circle Lake Harriet, popular for its beaches
and Victorian-style bandshell.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For more than a century, people have marveled at the Chain of Lakes in
Minneapolis.</p>
<p>It's not so much the beauty of the lakes, though they're glorious.
It's more the fact that ordinary folk can walk, bike, swim and play
around them — all of them.</p>
<p>It almost wasn't so. Back in 1882, landscape architect Horace Cleveland
had to argue his case for putting aside land on the city's lakes,
creeks and river.</p>
<p>&quot;Look forward a century, to the time when the city has a population of
a million, and think what will be their wants,&quot; he wrote.</p>
<p>&quot;They will have wealth enough to purchase all that money can buy, but
all their wealth cannot purchase a lost opportunity, or restore natural
features of grandeur and beauty, which would then possess priceless
value . . .&quot;</p>
<p>The city did buy land for parkways and boulevards, enough to put every
home in Minneapolis within six blocks of green space, and we're
enjoying it today — all million of us, it often seems on summer
weekends.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Lined with bike trails, beaches, canoe rentals, band shells, golf
courses and picnic pavilions, it's often called the best urban park
system in America.</p>
<p>The Grand Rounds, the walking/biking/driving route that follows the
parkways in a big circle around the city, is a <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/byways/byways/2243/maps">national scenic
byway</a>.</p>
<p>Commuter trails in the city and from the suburbs have made it easier to
reach by bike (for more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-minneapolis-st-paul/">Bicycling through the Minneapolis
suburbs</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/st-paul-bicycle-trails/">Bicycling in St. Paul
and beyond</a> ).</p>
<p>For bicyclists, riding the Grand Rounds is unmatched adventure.</p>
<h3>The south loop</h3>
<p>The 17-mile southern route, around the Chain of Lakes, Minnehaha Creek
and the Mississippi River, is very popular.</p>
<p>Before the <a href="http://www.midtowngreenway.org/">Midtown Greenway</a> was
built, bicyclists had to cut through downtown if they wanted to ride the
southern loop.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_greenway_fall.jpg" alt="Midtown Greenway in Minneapolis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Midtown Greenway cuts across town, connecting Lake Calhoun to the
Mississippi River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Now they can use that below-street, east-west bicycle superhighway,
paralleling 29th Street, to head south either from West River Parkway or
Bde Maka Ska, formerly Lake Calhoun.</p>
<p>From Bde Maka Ska, the path heads south past Wheels of Fun canoe and
kayak rental.</p>
<p>You'll pass a playground and beach before heading toward Lake Harriet
and its Victorian bandshell, where free concerts are held daily in
summer. There are more beaches on the east side of Harriet.</p>
<p>Then the path ducks into the enchantingly shady and secluded section
along Minnehaha Creek between Lake Harriet and Portland Avenue, one of
the few stretches with hills.</p>
<p>It continues east along the creek, between lakes Hiawatha and Nokomis.
Then it passes Minnehaha Park; be sure to stop to see the famous
Minnehaha Falls.</p>
<p>Then the path heads north along the Mississippi to the eastern end of
the Midtown Greenway at East 27th Street. Head back to Bde Maka Ska, or
continue through the University of Minnesota campus to the Mill
District, Stone Arch Bridge and St. Anthony Main.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>The north loop</h3>
<p>Bicyclists also can use the Greenway to ride a 24-mile northern loop
through Theodore Wirth Park and along the historic riverfront that's
just as interesting as the lakes section.</p>
<p>From Bde Maka Ska, the Grand Rounds heads north along Dean Parkway and
the west side of Cedar Lake. It crosses the highway, then plunges into
Wirth Park, where the Swiss-born dean of Minneapolis parks is honored
with a bronze statue, hand in hand with a bronze child, in front of the
chalet.</p>
<p>The Eloise Butler Wildflower Garden and Bird Sanctuary, renowned for its
spring ephemerals, and the Quaking Bog make fun stops in the park, which
is 60 percent as large as New York's Central Park.</p>
<p>From there, the Grand Rounds follows arrow-straight Victory Memorial
Parkway, where 568 trees were planted after World War I to honor fallen
Hennepin County soldiers.</p>
<p>Unlike the rest of the Grand Rounds, the parkway doesn't follow a
river, creeks or lakes; its wide-open green spaces were meant to serve
as a firebreak.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_guthrie.jpg" alt="A bicyclist rides by the Guthrie Theater." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A cyclists passes the Guthrie Theater on the west side of the Stone Arch
Bridge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The route continues on Webber Parkway before crossing the Mississippi on
the Camden Bridge, beneath which paved trails head north through
bottomlands to North Mississippi Regional Park.</p>
<p>Then, they can either head east on St. Anthony Parkway or south on
Marshall Street, along the river. The <a href="https://northeastminneapolisartsdistrict.org/">Northeast Minneapolis Arts
District</a> is centered
around the handsomely preserved 1891 Grain Belt Brewery at Broadway and
Marshall and along nearby 13th Avenue.</p>
<p>From the east side of the Broadway bridge, they can ride through Boom
Island Park and across two trestle bridges to Nicollet Island and St.
Anthony Main, whose renovated brick storefronts led the river
renaissance in the 1970s.</p>
<p>This is the <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/minneapolis-riverfront/">most historic part of the
city</a>.
Parkland and beautiful trails line both sides of the 3½-mile loop from
the Plymouth Avenue Bridge to J.J. Hill's graceful Stone Arch Bridge,
once slated for demolition but now the most beloved pedestrian
thoroughfare in town.</p>
<p>On the west side of the river, the Minnesota Historical Society operates
the Mill City Museum at Mill Ruins Park.</p>
<p>Next to it, the Grand Rounds passes under the cantilevered lobby of the
Guthrie Theater, its shimmering dark-blue facade embossed with towering
images of George Bernard Shaw, Eugene O'Neill, Anton Chekhov and four
other playwrights.</p>
<p>Two blocks south of the Guthrie, the <a href="http://www.traillink.com/trail/dinkytown-greenway.aspx">Dinkytown
Greenway</a> starts
behind the Red Cross building and takes bicyclists across the river and
through the East Bank campus of the University of Minnesota to Williams
Arena and TCF Bank Stadium.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From there, you can take the bike- and bus-only UM Transitway to the
Fairgrounds in St. Paul.</p>
<p>The Grand Rounds follows both sides of the river through the university
campus, the east sporting the brassy Weisman Art Museum and the west the
subdued glass flank of the Ted Mann Concert Hall.</p>
<h3>River loops</h3>
<p>Minnehaha Park is the starting point for several very scenic loops on
the banks of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>For a fairly easy 13-mile loop, ride over the Ford Parkway bridge to St.
Paul and south along the parkway or bike/walking path and into <a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/hidden_falls.htm">Hidden
Falls Regional
Park</a>. Paths
follow the river through <a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/crosfarm.htm">Crosby Farm Regional
Park</a> and on to the
I-35E bridge.</p>
<p>Go under it and across, then head north on the Big Rivers Regional Trail
to Mendota and across the Mendota Bridge.</p>
<p>Then you can either descend to Fort Snelling State Park and ride up the
hill to Minnehaha Park or stay on the bluff, riding past the entrance to
Fort Snelling Historic Site and along Hiawatha Avenue back to Minnehaha
Park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_bike_tour.jpg" alt="Minneapolis Bike Tour on West River Parkway." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicyclists on the Minneapolis Bike Tour in September head north on West
River Parkway.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A 22-mile loop starts in Minnehaha Park and goes the opposite way, down
into Fort Snelling State Park, across the Mendota Bridge and along the
river all the way to Harriet Island and downtown St. Paul, returning on
Summit Avenue or on the Samuel Morgan Trail.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Bicycling in Minneapolis</h3>
<p><em>Maps</em> : A <a href="https://www.minneapolisparks.org/parks__destinations/trails__parkways/grand_rounds_scenic_byway_system/">Grand
Rounds</a>
map is available at the Longfellow House in Minnehaha Park and at rec
centers and refectories along the route. There are also maps on kiosks
all along the route.</p>
<p>Richard Fred Arey's handy &quot;Twin Cities Bicycling&quot; ($16.95, Minnesota
Outdoors Press) contains a detailed, full-page map for the Grand Rounds
and many other rides. It's available in bookstores.</p>
<p><em>Renting a bike</em> : If you're visiting or don't have a bike, you can
rent one from hundreds of <a href="http://www.niceridemn.org/">Nice Ride
Minnesota</a> stations in Minneapolis and St.
Paul. Just take a bike from one station and return it to any other
station.</p>
<p><em>2022 events</em> : May 20-22, <a href="http://nemaa.org/art-a-whirl">Art-A-Whirl</a>
studio and gallery tour along Marshall Street and nearby in Northeast
Minneapolis. June 18-19, <a href="http://www.stonearchbridgefestival.com/">Stone Arch Bridge
Festival</a>. July 4,
<a href="http://www.mplsredwhiteboom.com/">Minneapolis Red White and Boom</a> on
the riverfront, with music and fireworks. July 23,
<a href="http://www.aquatennial.com/">Aquatennial</a> fireworks show.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_stone_arch_biking.jpg" alt="Bicycling on the Stone Arch Bridge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicyclists share the Stone Arch Bridge with runners, skaters and Segway
tourists.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Music</em> : On summer Sundays, time a bike trip to coincide with 2:30 or
5:30 p.m. concerts at the Lake Harriet Bandshell. Concerts are held
daily on other evenings, generally at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Minneapolis Parks also sponsors frequent concerts in Minnehaha Park and
a few at Father Hennepin Bluffs Park on the east end of the Stone Arch
Bridge.</p>
<p><em>Planning a route</em> : The streamlined route — bypassing Lake Nokomis
and Lake of the Isles, following the Mississippi to the St. Anthony
Falls Heritage Area instead of riding through northeast Minneapolis —
is 30 miles.</p>
<p>The loops around Nokomis and Lake of the Isles add three miles apiece.</p>
<p>If you ride the official route through northeast Minneapolis, skipping
the St. Anthony Falls area, you'll ride 33 miles, including the 2½-mile
gap from the Quarry to the river through the University of Minnesota
campus.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="http://www.midtowngreenway.org">Midtown Greenway</a> as a short
cut allows riders to create two other routes. The southern part of the
Grand Rounds, following the river and Chain of Lakes past Lake Nokomis,
is a 17-mile loop using the Midtown Greenway, which meets the
Mississippi at East 27th Street, by the trestle bridge.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_calhoun_biking.jpg" alt="Biking along Lake Calhoun in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A bicyclist rides along Bde Maka Ska/Lake Calhoun in fall.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The northern part of the Grand Rounds is a 24-mile loop using the
Midtown Greenway. From Webber Parkway, head south along the west side of
the river and cross to the east side at Broadway.</p>
<p>Across from Bottineau Community Library, take the sidewalk to quiet
Ramsey Street and on to Eighth Avenue. Head one block west and turn into
Boom Island Park, where a paved path goes straight to a trestle bridge.</p>
<p>Cross the bridge (carry your bike up the steps) and ride onto historic
Nicollet Island. At the other end, the 1887 Merriam Street trestle
bridge crosses to the St. Anthony Main area.</p>
<p>From tiny Father Hennepin Bluffs Park, the Stone Arch Bridge crosses to
Mill City Museum and the Guthrie Theater. From there, bike paths
continue south along the Mississippi to Minnehaha Park.</p>
<p><em>Tricky bits</em> : It's easy to follow the well-marked bike route, but
there are a few tricky bits.</p>
<p>At the north end of Bde Maka Ska, several commuter trails converge. To
head north on the Grand Rounds, ride a block on Dean Parkway, then take
Cedar Lake Road up the west side of Cedar Lake.</p>
<p>(An alternative is to take the Kenilworth Trail up the east side of
Cedar Lake, then head west on the Cedar Lake Trail to meet the Grand
Rounds as it heads toward Wirth Park.)</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_trestle.jpg" alt="The trestle bridge to Nicollet Island." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A trestle bridge connects Nicollet Island to St. Anthony Main.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>To close the loop from St. Anthony Parkway in northeast Minneapolis,
keep going on busy Stinson Boulevard across East Hennepin, where Stinson
turns into 18th Avenue. Turn west onto Como, then south on 15th Avenue
at Van Cleve Park.</p>
<p>Keep going on 15th past Dinkytown and into the University of Minnesota
campus to Pleasant Street. To continue on the west side of the river,
cross the Washington Avenue Bridge; to continue on the east, turn right
onto Arlington Street, before the bridge.</p>
<p><em>Highlights</em> : At the east end of the Washington Avenue Bridge, stop by
the stainless steel <em>Weisman Art Museum</em> ; admission is free. In
Minnehaha Park, see <em>Minnehaha Falls</em> .</p>
<p>For a cool dip, stop at the beaches of <em>lakes Nokomis, Harriet, Bde Maka
Ska</em> and <em>Cedar</em> . See the <em>Rose Garden</em> at Lake Harriet.</p>
<p>In Wirth Park, take a stroll in the <em>Quaking Bog</em> or <em>Eloise Butler
Wildflower Garden</em> ; on weekends, naturalists lead walks.</p>
<p>In the St. Anthony Falls area, visit the 1857 <em>Lady of Lourdes Church</em> ,
up the steps from Main Street on the east riverfront.</p>
<p>Ride across the <em>Stone Arch Bridge</em> and past the <em>Mill City Museum</em> and
the <em>Guthrie Theater</em> . On Saturday mornings from early May to
mid-October, there's the <a href="http://www.millcityfarmersmarket.org/">Mill City Farmers
Market</a> between the Guthrie and
Mill City Museum.</p>

<p><em>Repairs</em> <em>and rentals</em> : On the Midtown Greenway at Chicago Avenue, the
<a href="http://midtowngreenway.org/about-the-greenway/bike-center/">Freewheel Midtown Bike
Center</a> has
a bike shop, plus bathrooms and showers.</p>
<p>In Minnehaha Park, <a href="http://www.wheelfunrentals.com/listlocations/50">Wheels of
Fun</a> rents bicycles and
also surreys for up to four people. It's open daily from Memorial Day
to Labor Day, weekends only in May, September and October.</p>
<p><em>Where to eat</em> : When it's a beautiful day for bicycling, it's a
beautiful day for eating outdoors, too. Each of these restaurants has an
outdoor patio.</p>
<p>At East Lake Street and West River Parkway, the <a href="http://www.longfellowgrill.com">Longfellow
Grill</a> specializes in elaborate burgers
but has all kinds of fun food. It's open for breakfast, lunch and
dinner daily.</p>
<p>In the 1905 refectory in Minnehaha Park, <a href="https://www.seasaltmpls.com/">Sea Salt
Eatery</a> serves inexpensive seafood, such
as soft-shelled crab sandwiches and oyster po' boys. It's open daily
for lunch and dinner, 612-721-8990.</p>
<p>On the beach on the north end of Lake Nokomis,
<a href="http://sandcastlempls.com">Sandcastle</a> serves killer ceviche and
soft-serve ice-cream. (Watch for it; the main bike trail passes a block
away from the lake.)</p>
<p>At Lake Harriet, <a href="http://www.breadandpickle.com/">Bread &amp; Pickle</a> serves
sandwiches and treats plus breakfast.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_weisman.jpg" alt="Weisman Art Museum." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Weisman Art Museum is south of downtown on the East Bank.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's a Subway at the east end of Webber Parkway; for a picnic, buy
some sandwiches and take them to eat at the river overlook in Marshall
Terrace Park, at Marshall and 27th Avenue, or Gluek Park at Marshall and
19th Avenue.</p>
<p>Or eat at the <a href="http://the-sample-room.com/">Sample Room</a>, which has a
patio, at Marshall and 21st. In the St. Anthony Main area, bicyclists
can eat outdoors at the <a href="http://www.astercafe.com/">Aster Cafe</a> and
<a href="https://jefeminneapolis.com/">Jefe Urban Hacienda</a>.</p>
<p>For people who ride the official route and return to the river via 15th
Avenue Southeast, Dinkytown has many places to eat.</p>
<p>Just off the Midtown Greenway at Chicago Avenue, the <a href="http://www.midtownglobalmarket.org">Midtown Global
Market</a> has all kinds of wonderful
delis and restaurants.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : The limestone <a href="http://www.nicolletislandinn.com">Nicollet Island
Inn</a>, built in 1893 as the Island
Door and Sash Co., is in the middle of everything. It has a restaurant
and 24 individually decorated rooms, all with views and some with
whirlpool; ask about special rates. 612-331-1800.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sheratonminneapolismidtown.com/">Sheraton Midtown</a> is
right on the Midtown Greenway, next to Midtown Global Market and
Freewheel Bike Center.</p>
<p><em>Staying safe</em> : The trail is nearly all off-road, but you still need to
wear a <em>helmet</em> : You're much more likely to fall on your head by
swerving or locking wheels with another bike than you are to be hit by a
vehicle. And much of the trail is crowded on lovely weekends.</p>
<p><em>Information</em> : The 1906 <a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/longhous.htm">Longfellow
House</a> in Minnehaha
Park, a 2/3-size replica of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's home in
Massachusetts, has maps and brochures about history along the route.</p>
<p>It's open Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., 612-230-6520.
For maps through the mail, call 612-230-6400.</p>
