<h2>Quietly, this low-profile but ambitious state has piled on miles of trails.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/dubuque_heritage_trail.jpg" alt="Bicyclists on Dubuque's Heritage Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Heritage Trail west of Dubuque runs through a shady valley.

<p>For a long time, Iowa has been a great place to ride a bike.</p>
<p>It's not as flat as people think, and it has an excellent network of
paved county roads.</p>
<p>RAGBRAI, a cross-state bike ride that spawned many imitators when it
debuted in 1973, now is so popular that its 8,500 week-long riders, who
come from 50 states and 50 countries, are chosen by lottery.</p>
<p>It's one of the 50 Best American Adventures, says National Geographic
Traveler magazine. Sometimes, daily riders swell the crowd to 20,000.</p>
<p>But not many people outside the state know that Iowa also has hundreds
of miles of beautifully paved bicycle trails through river valleys and
along lakes.</p>
<p>Call it the curse of the corn field.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the part of Iowa you drive through on an interstate that
discourages them,&quot; says Anita O'Gara, development director of the
Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, which helps acquire land for trails.</p>
<p>So get off the interstate and try a trail — say, in the 11 counties
around Des Moines, where 200 miles of trails are forming giant loops.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>One May, I rode the Raccoon River Valley Trail west of Des Moines, where
life was busting out all over.</p>
<p>Just outside Yale, a doe crashed out of the brush and bounded onto
freshly plowed fields.</p>
<p>Near Redfield, weeds erupted right out of the bike path, atop little
volcanoes of soft asphalt. The rich, black earth here is among the most
fertile on the planet, which is why, out of 28 million acres of Iowa's
native prairie, only a few thousand escaped the plow.</p>
<p>People who ride this trail pick up all kinds of interesting tidbits.
Adel, a pretty town with brick streets, stood in for Des Moines during
the filming of &quot;Bridges of Madison County,&quot; and its magnificent 1902
French Chateau courthouse appears in the film.</p>
<p>It's not the only Iowa trail that has links to Hollywood. The 26-mile
Heritage Trail out of Dubuque ends in Dyersville, just three miles from
the &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; site.</p>
<p>I rode that trail another May, past limestone-pocked hills and a ski
area while following the Little Maquoketa River.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/e/cedar_rapids_bicyclist2.jpg" alt="Bicyclists on the Cedar Valley Nature Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the north edge of Cedar Rapids, a bicyclist heads out on the Cedar
Valley Nature Trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From Dyersville, I rode to the movie site, where cars from five states
were parked in a lot next to the diamond, their occupants emerging with
baseball gloves and video cameras.</p>
<p>In northern Iowa, the 15½-mile River City Greenbelt links Clear Lake,
where Buddy Holly played the night he died in a plane crash, and Mason
City, setting for &quot;The Music Man.&quot;</p>
<p>Other trails are renowned for scenery. The 63-mile Wabash Trace Nature
Trail, from Council Bluffs to the Missouri border through the rare loess
hills, is being called one of the nation's best trails.</p>
<p>North of Des Moines, the 26-mile Neal Smith Trail follows big
Saylorville Lake into Big Creek State Park, ending at its beach.</p>
<p>But most trails, like the Heritage out of Dubuque and the Raccoon River,
combine scenic river valleys with farmland.</p>
<p>Farmland usually isn't seen as a plus, but trail regulars say it gives
them a window into Iowa's soul.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;We ride the Raccoon River trail from March through November, every
weekend,&quot; said Nancy Shafer of Des Moines. &quot;We see the farmers plowing
their fields, then putting in seeds. We see a little bit of green, then
knee-high by the Fourth of July.</p>
<p>&quot;This is rural Iowa,&quot; she says. &quot;This is what it's all about. It's
pretty exciting.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, Iowa has a trail for everyone. There are crushed-limestone paths
for walkers and people who prefer a natural appearance. There are
asphalt paths for in-line skaters and people who like to ride hard.</p>
<p>There are paths around tourist areas, such as Pella, Okoboji, Storm Lake
and the Amana Colonies.</p>
<p>&quot;In the early '80s, the Elroy-Sparta (in Wisconsin) and (Minnesota's)
Root River were really big influences on us,&quot; O'Gara says. &quot;But we
have a lot of success stories in Iowa now.&quot;</p>
