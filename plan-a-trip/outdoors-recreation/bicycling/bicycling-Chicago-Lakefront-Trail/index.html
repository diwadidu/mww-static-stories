<p>Everything that's worth doing, you can do along Chicago's lakefront.</p>
<p>Seniors in Speedos climb out of Lake Michigan after swimming laps. Chess
players hunch over boards in a 1957 pavilion that looks like the
Jetsons' carport. Young people gather for beach volleyball and paddle
kayaks in the shadow of yachts.</p>
<p>Overhead, a biplane pulls a flapping beer banner through the sky.</p>
<p>Is this Fort Lauderdale? No, but you couldn't tell from the string of
beaches, golf courses and marinas.</p>
<p>On fine summer days, the city and all its tourists converge on Lake
Michigan and its bright Listerine-colored water, dotted by white sails.
In its parks, people skate, bike, jog, fish, fly kites and play tennis.</p>

<p>When we were in Chicago one Labor Day weekend, we saw the whole thing on
bikes, riding the 18-mile Lakefront Trail from end to end.</p>
<p>The first afternoon, we rented bikes at Millennium Park and made our way
to the lakefront, passing gourmet picnickers with hibachis and tourists
clicking away at Buckingham Fountain.</p>
<p>Crossing the Chicago River, we threaded our way through crowds heading
to Navy Pier and rode into Olive Park.</p>
<p>At an overlook, we gazed across the water at elegant high-rise
apartments on shoreline that was underwater until a character named
George Streeter paid contractors to dump their debris there and then,
with his new land, seceded from the city.</p>
<p>Many of the parks — Lincoln, Grant, Burnham — also were created from
landfill.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From Ohio Street Beach, we rode to busy Oak Street Beach and Lincoln
Park. Amid a stream of skaters and bicyclists, we passed the Chess
Pavilion and Theater on the Lake, where local troupes stage plays in
summer.</p>
<p>At Belmont Harbor, we circled the marina and stopped to watch dogs
playing on a spit of sand.</p>
<p>We found a bird sanctuary amid the dunes at Montrose Harbor and fly
fishermen casting lines from concrete risers. But on the other side of
the point, we lost sight of the downtown skyline and turned back.</p>
<p>Back at Belmont, the dogs had jumped into the water. At Oak Street
Beach, the lifeguards still were out in rowboats, keeping an eye on
swimmers bathed in golden light.</p>
<p>Even at dusk, Millennium Park was jumping. Crowds still circled the
mirrorlike Cloud Gate sculpture, popularly known as the Bean, and from a
distance, it looked as if a squadron of ants was marching across its
silvery surface.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In its reflection, the sky had turned a deep midnight blue, and the city
lights had multiplied into a galaxy, but most onlookers had eyes only
for themselves.</p>
<p>Returning the next morning, we rented the last two bicycles and headed
south. We passed the Field Museum and then rebuilt Soldier Field, whose
old Doric columns now hug blue stands for Bears fans.</p>
<p>At the entry to Burnham Harbor, alongside McCormick Place, we stopped
and sat on a ring of limestone blocks, watching the little dramas around
us. A little boy dropped his fishing pole from the seawall into the
lake.</p>
<p>Geese goose-stepped across the trail, trying to stay ahead of speeding
cyclists. In the water, a young man gunned the engine of a ridiculously
phallic cigarette boat, and we snickered as a svelte sailboat slipped
easily past him.</p>
<p>The grounds of McCormick Place, called &quot;Mistake on the Lake,&quot; also have
been redone, and now a waterfall courses down its monolithic flank.</p>

<p>Department-store magnate Montgomery Ward spent 20 years fighting the
city and his fellow businessmen to keep this lakefront open to the
public, largely succeeding through the 1909 Burnham Plan. The convention
complex was seen as the most notable betrayal of his legacy.</p>
<p>We pedaled south, past more beaches and children's &quot;playlots&quot; to
Promontory Point. In a handsome stone park house with a round tower,
three young women discussed plans for a wedding.</p>
<p>Water-skiers circled the point, and a sunbather stretched out on the
limestone seawall, framed by the hazy downtown skyline.</p>
<p>We stopped to eat Polish sausages and freshly squeezed lemonade at 57th
Street Beach, then rode on to 63rd Street Beach, which included a
palatial Arts and Crafts beachhouse.</p>
<p>Past the tree-shaded Jackson Park golf course, we rode through
landscaped gardens up to the door of the South Shore Cultural Center, a
1908 Arts and Crafts manor with crystal chandeliers, French doors and
bas-relief ornamentation.</p>
<p>Looking at our map, we saw we could use bike lanes to get within a few
blocks of Indiana if we kept riding.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But we turned back, stopping to watch cormorants diving for fish and
retrievers fetching rubber bones.</p>
<p>At the Field Museum, we bought a Popsicle from a cart, near a long line
of people waiting for the water taxi to Navy Pier.</p>
<p>We couldn't bear to return our bikes until we had to, so we rode back to
Lincoln Park and took the North Avenue underpass to Old Town, where we
ate seafood cavatappi and cannoli on the geranium-bedecked sidewalk
outside Orso's.</p>
<p>Chicago has come a long way since 1904, when muckraker Lincoln Steffens
called it &quot;unlovely and ill-smelling.&quot; A century of sweat,
slaughterhouses and sacrifices built this city, now overflowing with
flowers.</p>
