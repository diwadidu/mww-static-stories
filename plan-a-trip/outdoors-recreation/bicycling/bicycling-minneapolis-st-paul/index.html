<h2>An expanding web of trails takes bicyclists from the city into the lake-filled countryside.</h2>

From Wayzata, the Dakota Rail Trail passes many ponds, wetlands and

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For decades, the scenic bicycle trails around Minneapolis' Chain of
Lakes have drawn people from the suburbs into the city. Now, it's the
city folks' turn to visit.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people daily ride the Dakota Rail Trail, which takes
bicyclists past a chain of ponds, wetlands and bays on the north shore
of Lake Minnetonka, through some of its toniest villages.</p>
<p>One of the newest trails connects the oldest trail. From the west border
of Minneapolis, the Luce Line Regional Trail passes two swimming beaches
and a sea of cattails on its way from Theodore Wirth Park to the Luce
Line State Trail.</p>
<p>It's the last link in a 48-mile chain of five trails between the
Mississippi River in south Minneapolis and the rural town of Winsted.</p>
<p>Bicyclists also can ride east from the Lake Minnetonka town of
Excelsior, once the last stop on the Twin City Rapid Transit Co.
streetcar line, to the easternmost stop on White Bear Lake, nearly to
the St. Croix River.</p>
<p>On the way, they'll use five trails, a university transitway and city
parkways.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Trails go right up to Fort Snelling, the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden,
the Guthrie and Target Field, the Twins' new stadium. Most big
festivals, such as the three arts fairs held in Minneapolis on the
second weekend of August, are on or near trails, so bicyclists get a
free pass around congestion.</p>
<p>People have caught on to the convenience; in 2010, Bicycling magazine
first named Minneapolis America's Best Bike City, dethroning longtime
champ Portland, Ore. (in 2012, Portland won the title back).</p>
<p>One day, a friend and I revisited the Luce Line, the first Twin Cities
bike trail, and we found ourselves way out in Watertown. That state
trail is remarkably rural and leafy, considering it starts in the
second-ring suburb of Plymouth.</p>
<p>From my first ride in the early 1980s, I remembered many houses; this
time, we barely saw any, no doubt because trees along the trail have had
a long time to grow.</p>
<p>We did see a lot of sumac, which means the trail will show nice fall
color from September, and we counted two raspberry-pickers.</p>
<p>On the west end, we saw egrets, herons and what looked like a black mink
running across the trail; just east of Watertown, the Luce Line passes
Oak Lake, so big that it had whitecaps on the day we rode by.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_cedar_commuter.jpg" alt="Bicyclists on Minneapolis' Cedar Lake Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Minneapolis' Cedar Lake Commuter Trail takes bicyclists to and from
downtown.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The trail also is straight, flat as a pancake and protected from wind
-the round-trip from Plymouth to Watertown was the easiest 38 miles
I've ever ridden.</p>
<p>The new Luce Line Regional Trail, which connects the Plymouth trailhead
to Wirth Park on the Minneapolis border, is a mixed bag.</p>
<p>It passes industrial plants and office parks, but it also crosses an
ocean of cattails on two wooden bridges, dips into a shady woods and
puts overheated bicyclists within half a mile of swimming beaches on
Medicine and Parkers lakes.</p>
<p>In St. Paul, the Gateway State Trail starts in the shadow of Interstate
35 and immediately passes a small lake, unseen by any motorist. Even in
the city, the trail is shady and quiet.</p>
<p>On the two-lane Cedar Lake Commuter Trail, the exit to the Minneapolis
Sculpture Garden, on the edge of downtown Minneapolis, takes bicyclists
past Spring Lake. Who's ever heard of Spring Lake, much less seen it? I
have, now. It's lovely.</p>
<p>You can't see most of these places in a car, nor would most people
choose to. But from a bicycle, they're a revelation-new and
interesting things right in our front yard, but seen through the back
door.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Bicycling from Minneapolis to the suburbs</h3>
<p><em>Maps</em> : Three Rivers Parks District has done a fine job putting kiosks
with maps along its routes in the western Minneapolis suburbs.</p>
<p>For a copy of its handy &quot;Guide to Parks &amp; Trails,&quot; call 763-559-9000
or pick one up at the Depot Coffeehouse in Hopkins, at the southeast
corner of Excelsior Boulevard and Minnesota 169.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Bike Atlas ($19.95, Twin Cities Bicycling Club and
Hostelling International), available at bike shops and bookstores,
includes a CD of maps that can be printed out. Its tours use a
combination of trails, streets and roads.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.hudsonmap.com/">Hudson's Twin Cities Street Atlas</a> or
similar map will help locate parking areas and ways to form loops.</p>
<p><em>Staying safe:</em> Even on off-road trails, bicyclists need to wear
helmets: You're much more likely to fall on your head by locking wheels
with another bike or by stopping suddenly than you are to be hit by a
car.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/h/three_rivers_trails_map.jpg" alt="Three Rivers Parks trails map." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Three Rivers Parks District bicycle trails encircle Lake Minnetonka.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Motorists, especially in cities, are increasingly likely to stop at
bicycle crossings. But be watchful when a driver motions you to cross;
other cars, obscured by the stopped car, may not stop.</p>
<p><em>Trail conditions</em> : All of the trails are paved except for the Luce
Line and the two LRT trails. Those have a surface of finely crushed
limestone that is fine for touring bikes, although the dust tends to
coat bicycle chains and bags.</p>
<p><em>Renting a bike</em> : If you're visiting or don't have a bike, you can
rent one by the hour or day from <a href="http://www.niceridemn.org/">Nice Ride
Minnesota</a> kiosks in Minneapolis.</p>
<h3>Trails in the western Minneapolis suburbs</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.threeriversparks.org/location/dakota-rail-regional-trail"><strong>Dakota Rail Regional
Trail</strong></a>
: This 25½-mile paved trail starts from the city beach in Wayzata and
heads straight through the bays of Lake Minnetonka to the exurb of St.
Bonifacius and on to rural Mayer.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/dakota-rail-trail-wayzata/">Riding the Dakota Rail
Trail</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/luce_line/index.html"><strong>Luce Line State
Trail</strong></a>
: This is the granddaddy of metro bike trails. Named for Col. William
Luce and his son E. D. Luce, who founded the Electric Short Line
Railroad Company in 1908, it starts in Plymouth and runs 45 miles west
to <a href="http://explorehutchinson.com/">Hutchinson</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/north_cedar_lake_trail.jpg" alt="A bicyclist on the North Cedar Lake Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A bicyclist passes under a highway on the North Cedar Lake Trail in St.
Louis Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's wonderfully leafy and rural, taking bicyclists over and under
highways on bridges and culverts and passing many wetlands and lakes.
The 19 miles from Plymouth to Watertown are straight and flat.</p>
<p>There's no source of water or food, though. In Watertown, Marketplace
Foods has a nice selection of drinks and snacks. Luce Line Lodge Bar &amp;
Grill is across the street.</p>
<p>From Winsted, the 15 miles to Hutchinson are paved.</p>
<p>The trail can be reached in Plymouth from Parkers Lake Park, just west
of I-494 off County Road 6, or by heading south on Vicksburg Lane to the
trailhead parking lot (turn at the Cimarron Ponds sign).</p>
<p>From I-394/U.S. 12 in Wayzata, take Gleason Lake Drive north to
Vicksburg Lane.</p>
<p>The state trail now is connected to Theodore Wirth Park and the Grand
Rounds in Minneapolis by the paved, nine-mile <a href="https://www.threeriversparks.org/location/luce-line-regional-trail"><strong>Luce Line Regional
Trail</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The eastern trailhead is just north of Minnesota 55/Olson Memorial
Highway and Wirth Parkway, just south of the park's Par 3 Golf Course
(park half a mile farther at the main golf course).</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The trail twists and turns, so pay attention. After passing Golden
Valley Golf and Country Club, turn instead of passing Calvary Lutheran
Church. There's a fork after the Plymouth industrial/office park; turn
left there (although there's a swimming beach on Medicine Lake .4 miles
to the right) and also at the next unmarked fork.</p>
<p>Just before the regional trail connects to the state trail at Vicksburg
Lane, it runs parallel to Parkers Lake, which has a swimming beach on
the opposite side.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.threeriversparks.org/location/lake-minnetonka-lrt-regional-trail"><strong>Lake Minnetonka LRT Regional
Trail</strong></a>
: Formerly known as the Southwest LRT northern corridor, this 15-mile
trail goes through the town of Excelsior, which has many places to eat
and shop (see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/excelsior-lake-minnetonka/">Cruising around
Excelsior</a> ), and on to
Victoria, with access to Carver Park Reserve.</p>
<p>The trailhead is in Hopkins on the west side of Eighth Avenue, just
north of Main Street, not far from the Depot Coffeehouse.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.threeriversparks.org/location/minnesota-river-bluffs-lrt-regional-trail"><strong>Minnesota River Bluffs LRT Regional
Trail</strong></a>
: Formerly known as the Southwest LRT southern corridor, this trail
heads 11½ miles to Chanhassen, descending to the Minnesota River valley
through Minnetonka and Eden Prairie.</p>
<p>The trailhead is at the Depot Coffeehouse in Hopkins, at the southeast
corner of Excelsior Boulevard and Minnesota 169.</p>
<p>The trails also connect to many <a href="https://www.threeriversparks.org/index.php/biking">regional trails in Three Rivers Park
District</a>. For a
guide to parks and trails, call 763-559-9000.</p>
<h3>Connecting trails from Minneapolis</h3>
<p>The very popular 5½-mile <a href="http://www.midtowngreenway.org/">Midtown
Greenway</a>, operated by a nonprofit
coalition, cuts across south Minneapolis from the Mississippi River to
Bde Maka Ska. It is paved and uses an above-street railroad trestle from
the river through the Seward neighborhood, paralleling 27th Street.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_luce_line.jpg" alt="A bicyclist passes Oak Lake on the Luce Line." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Luce Line State Trail, a bicyclist passes Oak Lake near
Watertown.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>West of Hiawatha Avenue, it uses a below-street trench that parallels
29th Street. Bicyclists heading for the Metrodome and downtown can leave
the Greenway at its bridge over Hiawatha and ride on a paved path along
the light-rail train route.</p>
<p>On the Greenway, across from the Midtown Global Market at Chicago
Avenue, the <a href="https://midtowngreenway.org/about-the-greenway/bike-center/">Freewheel Midtown Bike
Center</a>
fixes and rents bicycles and also has showers, water and bathrooms.</p>
<p>The Greenway continues through Uptown and passes Bde Maka Ska, then
connects with Three Rivers Park District's four-mile <a href="https://www.threeriversparks.org/index.php/location/cedar-lake-lrt-regional-trail"><strong>Cedar Lake
Regional
Trail</strong></a>
and continues west to the Depot Coffeehouse in Hopkins and the LRT
trails. However, the Cedar Lake trail is closed through 2021 for
light-rail construction. A
<a href="https://services.slpgis.org/AGO/Gallery/LRTTrailDetour.pdf?fbcli">detour</a>
is marked with signs.</p>
<p>Also from the end of the Midtown Greenway, the 1½-mile <strong><a href="http://www.minneapolismn.gov/www/groups/public/@publicworks/documents/webcontent/convert_272206.pdf">Kenilworth
Trail</a></strong>
heads north toward downtown, where it runs into the city-owned 3.5-mile
<strong><a href="http://www.minneapolismn.gov/bicycles/projects/cedar-lake-trail">Cedar Lake
Trail</a></strong>
under I-394.</p>
<p>Downtown, the Cedar Lake Trail passes Target Field and connects to the
Grand Rounds and Minneapolis riverfront at 3rd Avenue, across from
Nicollet Island.</p>
<p>Heading west, it follows the north side of Cedar Lake and turns into
Three Rivers Parks District's 4.3-mile <a href="https://www.threeriversparks.org/location/north-cedar-lake-regional-trail"><strong>North Cedar Lake Regional
Trail</strong></a>, which continues to the Depot Coffeehouse in Hopkins and the LRT
trails.</p>
<p>Bicyclists also can head in two other directions from trail junctions
just south of downtown, adjoining the Kenwood neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>East to the Sculpture Garden</strong> From the Spring Lake exit of the Cedar
Lake Trail, it's half a mile to the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden.</p>
<p><strong>North to Wirth Park and the Luce Line</strong> :
Next to the city demolition-debris yard, there's a spiral ramp to an
overpass from which there's a two-mile, well-marked <strong>connecting route
to the Luce Line Regional Trail</strong> in Wirth Park.</p>
<p>The signs stop at the Glenwood Avenue entry to the park; from Glenwood,
turn north onto Theodore Wirth Parkway and watch for the trailhead just
north of Highway 55.</p>
<p>The well-marked <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/grand-rounds/">Grand Rounds National Scenic Byway</a>
(see below) also connects to Wirth Park, following the west side of
Cedar Lake and coming from Bde Maka Ska via Dean Parkway, under the
Midtown Greenway.</p>
