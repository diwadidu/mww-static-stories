<p>There are certain bicycle trails that inspire loyalty in those who ride
them.</p>
<p>For many, it's the trail that's closest to home. For others, it's the
trail that runs by a really fine restaurant. And for some, it's the
route with the most wildlife.</p>
<p>One of my favorite trails, the 14½-mile Red Cedar State Trail out of
Menomonie, Wis., has all of these things and more. It's one of the least
crowded trails, because the crushed-limestone surface keeps some people
away.</p>
<p>And it's one of the longest, counting the 30-mile Chippewa State Trail,
which takes up where the Red Cedar leaves off and continues on to Eau
Claire and Durand.</p>
<p>This trail even has a craft brewery next to its trailhead, Lucette
Brewing, which serves wood-fired pizza as well as ales.</p>
<p>But the Red Cedar State Trail has yet one thing more: a fast-moving
river, once used to float giant rafts of lumber down to the Chippewa,
before the Milwaukee Road line was built.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>One September, a friend and I decided to canoe down the river, then
bicycle back.</p>
<p>It was a complicated plan: Drive to the end of the trail, lock the bikes
near a bridge, drive back to Menomonie's Riverside Park and launch the
canoe. Paddle to the end of the trail, lock up the canoe, ride the bikes
back and then go pick up the canoe.</p>
<p>We put in at Riverside Park, where a fisherman sat under a tree, three
lines radiating from his lawn chair. The river was low, and we soon
learned to train a suspicious eye on any kind of ripples that could
betray boulders.</p>
<p>A few bicyclists wove along the trail, and they all waved when they saw
us; in the 90-degree heat, we were comrades.</p>
<p>After a stretch of whitewater, we paddled in peace, past canyon-like
walls of gold sand, with ripples down their sheer faces that mirrored
the river.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We passed Downsville, a picnic table marking its canoe take-out, and
went under a trestle bridge, one of 11 along the trail.</p>
<p>On a sandbar we stopped for a swim, fighting to stay abreast of the
current. Getting out, we traced the tracks of raccoon and sandpipers on
the sugar sand and looked at the lacy leaves of dune plants.</p>
<p>As we paddled on past wooded bluffs, a bald eagle wheeled overhead. The
oak barrens and bottomland forest along the trail are good places to see
wildlife; in the spring, eagles, osprey and red-shouldered hawks often
are spotted, along with blue and green heron.</p>
<p>It took us 3½ hours to get to the bridge at Dunnville and County Road Y.
Then, on our bikes, we rode through the Dunnville Wildlife Area to the
Red Cedar's confluence with the Chippewa.</p>
<p>There, we paused on the 860-foot trestle bridge high above the wide,
pancake-flat bottomlands, through which the Chippewa carved a looping
path into the horizon.</p>
<p>The trail looked tempting; it's seal-coated, a step up from crushed
limestone. But it was getting late, so we turned around and headed up
the Red Cedar. The stretch from Dunnville to Downsville was shady and
intimate, through woods and small meadows.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Once, our approach alarmed a flock of a dozen young turkeys, who ran
helter-skelter along the path before fleeing into the forest on
sticklike legs.</p>
<p>We passed an old cut-stone quarry and crossed the river at Downsville.
By the time we got to the Devil's Punchbowl, a dripping rock wall that
looms above the trail near Menomonie, we were sharing the path with
runners and dog-walkers.</p>
<p>At Riverside Park, a boy was pulling a silver bass from the water.</p>
<p>Then we retrieved the canoe and hurried to a local restaurant, where we
gratefully plopped into comfy chairs and had cold ales while
contemplating the daily specials of pasta and grilled meats and fish.</p>
<p>It was good to spend a day in the tracks of 1800s riverpigs and gandy
dancers, but it was also good to get back to civilization.</p>
