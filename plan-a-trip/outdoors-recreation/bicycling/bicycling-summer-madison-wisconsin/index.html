<h2>In warm months, head for the brewpubs, bicycle trails and lakes of this exuberant college town.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_bicycle_fishing.jpg" alt="Bicycling along Madison's Lake Monona." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In summer, it's hard to know what to do first in beer- and
bicycle-loving Madison.</p>
<p>Bike along Lake Monona, or on the Capital City State Trail? Have a beer
and listen to blues on the lakeside terrace of the Memorial Union, or
sit in the Bier Garten of Capital Brewery?</p>
<p>In summer, this college town is in its element. Its Great Taste of the
Midwest in August is the largest beer festival in Wisconsin and the
second-longest running craft-beer festival in North America.</p>
<p>Nearly 150 miles of state bike trails radiate from the town on three
sides, and it was one of the first platinum-level bicycle-friendly
communities designated by the <a href="https://bikeleague.org/">League of American
Bicyclists</a>.</p>
<p>But as much as Madison loves beer and bicycles, it also loves good food.
So on Saturdays, all roads lead to the Dane County Farmers' Market.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>During summer, that's the most happening scene in the People's Republic
of Madison, an idiosyncratic city of 230,000 that a disgruntled
Republican governor once called &quot;78 square miles surrounded by
reality.&quot;</p>
<p>Within this bastion of political correctness beats a party heart,
especially in the summer. How could it not, with a big lake on either
side of downtown, a dozen beaches, free concerts and miles of bicycle
paths to connect it all?</p>
<p>The first thing I did was set off along Gorham Street in a marked
bicycle lane, pedaling past James Madison Beach and the domed Capitol
before emerging onto the lower half of State Street, lined with &quot;Do Not
Enter&quot; signs that, in smaller print, read &quot;Except for Bicycles.&quot;</p>
<p>The University of Wisconsin lay at its end, and I circled around the
alumni center to the Memorial Union Terrace.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_state_street_09.jpg" alt="State Street in Madison." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In summer, the sidewalks of State Street are lined with shop goods.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A bluegrass band was playing over the hubbub from hundreds of people,
basking in the sun, drinking pitchers of beer and eating hamburgers from
the outdoors grill.</p>
<p>College girls in string bikinis and cut-offs tossed their hair on
speedboats anchored just offshore, as a steady stream of people carried
rented canoes into the water.</p>
<p>As I watched a windsurfer, a sun-bleached Peter Pan plopped down next to
me, offered a beer and embarked on a rambling tale that involved several
pounds of Maui Wowie, various escapades in Hawaii and Alaska and an
eventual return to Neverland.</p>
<p>My bike and I debarked mid-tale and followed the Howard Temin Lakeshore
Path through a tunnel of trees and around University Bay to Picnic
Point, where people sat around bonfires or on benches, gazing into the
sunset.</p>
<p>I traced my path back, except this time I got tangled in the 16 streets
that spin out of Capitol Square like a spider's web and are famous for
snagging tourists.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The next morning I set out again, stopping first at the farmers market.
Odessa Piper, whose pioneering restaurant L'Etoile made her a local
demigod, was there demonstrating how spring garlic can be cooked in
milk.</p>
<p>Vendors hawked baskets of glistening fruit, but everyone seemed to be
eating gooey caramel rolls.</p>
<p>From Capitol Square, I rode down to Monona Terrace, a convention center
first designed by Frank Lloyd Wright in 1938. A bike elevator took me to
the rooftop garden, where I listened to Caribbean music performed by the
rollicking Goongoo Peas.</p>
<p>Sitting on a marble bench dedicated to Otis Redding, I looked over Lake
Monona, where the King of Soul's plane crashed in 1967, en route to a
Madison concert.</p>
<p>Then the bike elevator took me down to the lakeshore path and Law Park,
where the Mad City Water Ski Team performs on Sunday evenings.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_canoe_mendota.jpg" alt="A canoeist on Madison's Lake Mendota." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A canoeist paddles away from the terrace of the Memorial Union, where
crowds gather to sunbathe and listen to music on summer days.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was 90 in the shade, and I headed south along Lake Monona, stopping
for a dip in Monona Bay at Brittingham Beach before riding the seven
blocks to shady Henry Vilas Zoo.</p>
<p>Entry is free, so I stopped to watch a bevy of flamingos while walking
through to Vilas Park, on Lake Wingra.</p>
<p>There was a beach there, so I took another dip before heading into the
University of Wisconsin Arboretum next door, where I foolishly turned
off McCaffery Drive and got lost.</p>
<p>I followed bike-route signs and came out on Monona Bay at Bernie's
Beach, where I gratefully joined a crowd in the water. Then, with the
help of another rider's map, I found my way to Olin Park and the path
around Lake Monona.</p>
<p>There was the white dome of the Capitol, gleaming across the water â€”
tourist trap, now bicyclist's friend. I pointed my tires in its
direction.</p>
