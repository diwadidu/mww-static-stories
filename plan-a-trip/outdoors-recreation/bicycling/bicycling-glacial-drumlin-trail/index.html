<h2>Mementos of a distant past line a bicycle trail through Lake Mills.</h2>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the middle of southern Wisconsin farmland, there's a mystery that
rivals those of the Mayans and Anasazi.</p>
<p>Riding along the 52-mile Glacial Drumlin State Trail east of Lake Mills,
I stopped on a bridge over the placid Crawfish River to read a plaque,
&quot;Glacial Time in Perspective.&quot;</p>
<p>It noted the retreat of the glaciers 143 lifetimes ago and then directed
me 1½ miles northward, to where, &quot;17 lifetimes ago, an ancient
civilization flourished.&quot;</p>
<p>There stood Aztalan State Park. Between 1100 and 1300, a cluster of the
Mississippian people lived here, growing corn, fishing in the river and
performing ceremonies atop two large, conical temple mounds, one of
which had two platforms reached by stairs and a priest's house on top.</p>
<p>A 12-foot log-and-clay stockade enclosed the 21-acre village, in which
three mounds and a natural knoll composed the corners of a plaza.
Excavations have shown signs of human sacrifice.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>What happened to the village? &quot;Evidence indicates an abrupt end.&quot; In
the 1950s and '60s, it was partially reconstructed, and visitors are
free to wander the grounds, wondering how temple mounds turned up in
Wisconsin.</p>
<p>From Aztalan, I rode through a shady tunnel of trees into Lake Mills,
where the annual festival had just started in and around leafy Commons
Park, complete with bandstand.</p>
<p>There, I bought a piece of rhubarb-strawberry pie a la mode from the
American Legion ladies auxiliary and watched children screeching on the
Tilt-A-Whirl.</p>
<p>Facing the square was a line of stately brick storefronts, some occupied
by antiques centers, gift shops and pubs; squeezed among them was a
little white shack, where the American Legion grills its renowned
&quot;sliders&quot; on Fridays.</p>
<p>It may look like a place where time stands still. But the town is less
than half an hour from Madison, and it's become a shopping
destination.</p>
<p>On Lake Street, Ephraim Faience Pottery makes its gorgeous Arts and
Crafts vases, pitchers and tiles in the basement and sells them in the
first-floor gallery.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_mills_sliders.jpg" alt="Buying sliders in Lake Mills." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Its limited runs have spurred the formation of a collector's society,
which has an office across the street.</p>
<p>On the southeast edge of town, just off the bike trail, James J.
Chocolates sells sweets from its candy kitchen.</p>
<p>But Lake Mills mostly is a hub for two of the things Wisconsin folks
like best: bicycles and beer.</p>
<p>Ten miles to the north, in Waterloo, Trek Bicycle Co. rented a barn and
began producing hand-built steel touring frames in 1976.</p>
<p>Now, its bicycles are known around the globe, and Lance Armstrong rode
them on all seven of his Tour de France victories. On Wednesdays, the
plant offers tours.</p>
<p>And in Lake Mills, Tyranena Brewing has been having fun with Aztalan
legends since it started brewing craft beers in 1999. First, it took
Lake Mills' original name, said to mean &quot;sparkling waters,&quot; for its
own.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It named its Stone Tepee pale ale for pyramid-shaped rock piles on the
floor of Rock Lake, and its Headless Man amber alt for an effigy mound.</p>
<p>Rocky's Revenge brown ale is named for a legendary serpent who guarded
the sacred tepees, and Three Beaches honey blonde for the beaches of
Rock Lake.</p>
<p>Its tasting room is open daily for sampling, and it offers live music in
its beer garden on summer weekends.</p>
<p>In late September, Tyranena sponsors an Oktoberfest bicycle tour,
incorporating both local passions. The Tyranena Beer Run Half Marathon,
part of which uses the Glacial Drumlin Trail, is the first Saturday in
November.</p>
<p>From downtown, I rode on past the cream-brick depot, passing Sandy
Beach, where sailors were coming in from a day on Rock Lake and diners
sat on the shady deck of a log restaurant.</p>
<p>Not far away was a plaque pointing out a long, slender hillock on a
farm, shaped like a boiled egg sliced lengthwise.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lake_mills_street.jpg" alt="Shopping in Lake Mills, Wisconsin." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>These drumlins are filled with rock and gravel carried along under
glaciers, and, the plaque noted, &quot;just about every spot of high ground
you see along this trail is a drumlin.&quot;</p>
<p>After that, I saw dozens of them, along with enough ripe black
raspberries to stock a supermarket.</p>
<p>Mementos of the Ice Age are everywhere in Wisconsin, but the seat of a
bicycle is one of the better ways to see them.</p>
