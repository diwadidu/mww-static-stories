</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In summer, overheated tourists head for the Cool City.</p>
<p>Two Rivers, Wis., gets its nickname from cooling breezes that come from
three sides: the East Twin River, the West Twin River and Lake
Michigan.</p>
<p>Swimmers can cool off with a dip from Neshotah Beach, a great strip of
sand, but there's an even better one five miles north, where Rawley
Point Lighthouse towers over the dunes of Point Beach.</p>
<p>Two Rivers also is the birthplace of the ice-cream sundae-how cool
is that?</p>
<p>From its small harbor, charter boats set out to fish for trout and
salmon. Two Rivers' sister city, Manitowoc, is known for larger boats:
the U.S.S. Cobia, a submarine docked alongside the Wisconsin Maritime
Museum, and the S.S. Badger, a coal-powered car ferry that makes daily
runs to Ludington, Mich.</p>
<p>Like Two Rivers, Manitowoc also is known for something sweet:
old-fashioned Beerntsen's Confectionary, which has occupied the same
elegant spot since 1932 and displays homemade chocolates as if they were
diamond bracelets.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Two bicycle trails link everything. From Manitowoc, the 5½-mile Mariners
Trail along Lake Michigan is straight, sunny, and wide open. From Two
Rivers, the six-mile Rawley Point Trail is twisting, shadowy and
slightly mysterious.</p>
<p>The beach to which it leads, lined with dune grass, is one of the finest
in the Upper Midwest.</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't that a gorgeous beach? That's how we found this place,&quot; says
tile artist Beth Vienot. &quot;It's always cooler here, and we would come up
from Milwaukee to go to the beach.&quot;</p>
<p>On one trip, Vienot and her husband, blacksmith Ned Guyette, saw a
for-sale sign on a magnificent English Tudor mansion built in 1927 for
the son of J.E. Hamilton, a Two Rivers manufacturer who figured out how
to mass-produce wood printing type and made a fortune.</p>
<p>Now, the two artists live in the house and operate Carreaux du Nord,
selling handmade Arts &amp; Crafts tiles in its oak-beamed great room.</p>
<p>The 1907 Red Forest B&amp;B, where we were staying, is across the street.
From there, we rode down Washington Street, past Hamilton's sprawling
factory and across the East Twin River to the Rawley Point Trail.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_rivers_lighthouse.jpg" alt="The Rawley Point lighthouse in Two Rivers." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The 1894 Rawley Point light in Point Beach State Forest is one of the
tallest and brightest on the Great Lakes.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From Sandy Bay Road, we followed it into cedar forest and along a
timber-rail fence on crushed limestone as white as Hansel and Gretel's
pebbles.</p>
<p>Soon, hemlock deepened the shadows. We emerged to sun-splashed dunes but
soon returned to forest and found ourselves on a quarter-mile stretch of
the Ice Age National Scenic Trail.</p>
<p>Once, Point Beach State Forest was the beach of a glacial lake; as it
retreated, it created a series of 11 sandy ridges and wetland troughs
called swales. From a bicycle, they look like a giant piece of
corrugated cardboard.</p>
<p>The trail was captivating, gently rising and falling, and we whooshed
along with scarcely any effort. We passed a 1929 chinked-timber cabin,
then the campground.</p>
<p>Then we heard the crashing of waves, jarring after the silent forest.
The trail ended across from the stone Point Beach Lodge concession
pavilion, built at the end of the Depression by Civilian Conservation
Corps crews.</p>
<p>Heading back, we walked onto the beach to see the 113-foot Rawley Point
Lighthouse. Before it was built in 1894, 26 ships foundered on the
point. The most tragic wreck was the steamship Vernon, which sank with
36 crew and passengers in 1887.</p>
<p>The most famous was the Rouse Simmons, the beloved Christmas Tree Ship,
which was on its way to Chicago in November 1912 when it ran into a
storm and sank with 17 men and a full load of trees.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Farther down the trail, we also checked out two large, wood-heated
cabins that have their own section of the park, private boardwalks to
the beach, dining pavilions, water pumps and fire pits with benches. At
$60 apiece, they're one of the region's best deals, and competition for
them is fierce.</p>
<p>In Two Rivers, we followed Lake Michigan through Neshotah Park and soon
saw signs for the Mariners Trail.</p>
<p>But first, we stopped at Kurtz's Pub for sundaes, which were as good as
we'd heard, covered with velvety, homemade hot fudge and topped with
whipped cream and toasted almonds.</p>
<p>The story is that, in 1881, a customer asked soda fountain owner Ed
Berners to top his ice cream with a chocolate sauce that previously had
been used only in sodas.</p>
<p>He continued to serve it, but only on Sundays, until one day, a
10-year-old insisted on ice cream &quot;with that stuff on top,&quot; saying they
could &quot;pretend it was Sunday.&quot; Later, a glassware salesman who couldn't
spell placed an order for canoe-shaped &quot;sundae dishes.&quot;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the New York town of Ithaca also claims it invented the
sundae, when a drugstore owner served one to a local minister in 1892,
and it can show a newspaper ad promoting the &quot;Cherry Sunday.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/point_beach_bicyclists2_cabin.jpg" alt="Bicyclists pass a pioneer cabin in Point Beach State Forest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Point Beach State Forest, the Rawley Point Trail passes a restored
1929 cabin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The two towns carry on a friendly but pointed feud. Two Rivers put a
coupon for a free sundae in the Ithaca newspaper. Ithaca placed an ad in
the Manitowoc paper that read, &quot;Dear Two Rivers, Got Proof? We Do.
Love, Ithaca.&quot;</p>
<p>From Kurtz's, we crossed the West Twin River and rode onto the paved
Mariners Trail. It follows the highway and doesn't have the atmosphere
of the Rawley Point Trail.</p>
<p>But its lake breezes keep bicyclists cool and mosquito-free on humid
days, and it's lined with flower beds. On the edge of Manitowoc, riders
can pull off for a free walk through West of the Lake Gardens, six acres
of formal perennial gardens on the lakeshore.</p>
<p>We pulled into Manitowoc at 4 p.m. on a Saturday, but already most shops
were closed. The seafoam-green Persimmons gallery looked especially fun,
with windows stuffed with a gilded bird cage, silver-tinsel tree, clown
piñata and oil painting of a chicken. A sign read, &quot;We ooze creativity
(and like to share).&quot;</p>
<p>But Beerntsen's Confectionary was open. It's open 12 hours a day, seven
days a week, and a steady stream of cars pulled up to patronize it.</p>
<p>The chocolate shop has occupied its spot in the imposing Dempsey
Building since 1932, and it looks like a jewelry store, all polished
wood and glowing sconces.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It had sold out of European-style molded chocolates, a big
disappointment, but it had plenty of store-made novelty items, fairy
food and chocolate bark made with Door County cherries.</p>
<p>On a bench outside the shop, local resident John MacLean was relaxing
with a cup of coffee, and he explained why Manitowoc was so quiet.</p>
<p>&quot;It's old Wisconsin; people want to spend time with their families,&quot; he
said. Then he waved his arm at the many bars down the street. &quot;But this
is the lull before the storm,&quot; he added. &quot;If you're here at 2:30 in the
morning, you won't think it's dead; there's plenty of hootin' and
hollering.&quot;</p>
<p>We came back to Manitowoc the next day to tour the Wisconsin Maritime
Museum on the harbor. During the Second World War, 7,000 employees of
the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co. worked around the clock, producing 28
submarines for the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>The town had a perfect harbor for submarines, which could be launched on
their side into the Manitowoc River. Docked alongside the museum, the
U.S.S. Cobia was built in Groton, Conn., but it's the same type of
submarine made in Manitowoc and has been restored to its 1945 condition.</p>
<p>The all-volunteer silent service, as it was called, was perhaps the most
demanding branch of the military.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/manitowoc_submarine.jpg" alt="The Cobia submarine in Manitowoc." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Manitowoc, the USS Cobia is open for tours and occasional overnights.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On our tour, the guide gave us some interesting numbers: 93 percent of
men failed to get through training. If they did, they got 50 percent
more pay than other servicemen. And 23 percent died while serving.</p>
<p>The Maritime Museum also pays tribute to sport boating, with a hall full
of antique beauties, such as a 1907 oak-and-cedar yacht called the Lady
Isabel and a sleek 1932 racing hydroplane. At the virtual-fishing
station, we reeled in an 89-pound sailfish.</p>
<p>Manitowoc still is a maritime town. Across from the museum, fishermen
lined the quay, and a big pile of coal awaited the boilers of the S.S.
Badger, a giant 1953 car ferry that gives tourists a fun short-cut
across Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>On the other side of downtown, freighters deliver barley to the
Budweiser malting plant.</p>
<p>Two Rivers and Manitowoc are working towns, but they offer plenty for
tourists. On a bicycle, it's easy to find out what.</p>
