<p>We all know Milwaukee for its beer, bratwurst and oompah bands.</p>
<p>But not many people know it's also a great place for bicycling.</p>
<p>Sure, there's a constant stream of bicyclists on the lakefront stretch
of the Oak Leaf Trail. From Lake Michigan, bicyclists can veer off onto
a secluded stretch of the Milwaukee River or head toward Miller Park on
the Hank Aaron Trail.</p>
<p>They can ride west almost to Madison on the Glacial Drumlin Trail. They
can head north on Lake Drive and, on the edge of the city, catch the
Interurban Trail, which will take them to Cedarburg, Port Washington,
Belgium and Oostburg.</p>
<p>In town, more than 100 miles of paved off-road paths, parkway drives and
connecting streets take bicyclists everywhere they want to go: to
breweries for tours, to festivals or to the beach.</p>
<p>Why drive a car? It's so much easier to bike.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.interurbantrail.us/">Interurban Trail</a> from Thiensville to Belgium</h3>
<p>One June, I rode the Interurban Trail in Ozaukee County, where electric
trolleys ran between Milwaukee and Sheboygan until 1948.</p>
<p>Today, the old railway is a 30-mile paved trail that links bicyclists
and skaters from the Milwaukee suburbs to old German mill towns, a port
town full of yachts and a village settled by Luxembourgers.</p>
<p>You can get to it on a new extension of the Oak Leaf Trail, riding past
Estabrook and Brown Deer parks.</p>
<p>But I started in the town park of <em>Mequon</em> , one of the state's
earliest German settlements, and within a block was in <em>Thiensville</em> ,
where a German immigrant built a mill along a bend in the Milwaukee
River.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_reservoir_park.jpg" alt="A bicyclist in Milwaukee's Reservoir Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A bicyclist gets a view of Milwaukee from the trail that runs through
Reservoir Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The bike trail parallels Main Street, but I found the interesting part
of town-the stone mill, a cheerful coffee shop in a Victorian house,
an old-fashioned village park-off Green Bay Road, just to the east.</p>
<p>From Thiensville, the trail had barely left the houses behind before it
entered <em>Cedarburg</em> , a popular getaway destination for people from
Milwaukee and Chicago.</p>
<p>Shops and a winery fill its 1864 woolen mill and the handsome stone
buildings along Washington Avenue, where crowds were shopping and
stuffing themselves with brats and strawberry shortcake during
Strawberry Festival.</p>
<p>A little trestle bridge crosses Cedar Creek in the middle of town and
leads through quiet neighborhoods to <em>Grafton</em> , a Milwaukee River mill
town that is not as carefully preserved as Cedarburg but still has many
old stone buildings.</p>
<p>One of the prettiest spots on the trail is just north of town, where a
new iron bridge crosses the river.</p>
<p>From there, the trail crosses over Interstate 43 and descends into <em>Port
Washington</em> , a picturesque village with a marina full of charter
fishing boats, a 1935 art deco light station and a historic downtown
where Leland Stanford practiced law before he left to join the Gold Rush
and become governor of California.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At the quirky Pebble House, built in 1848 of mortar and round stones
collected from the Lake Michigan beach, I ran into tourism director
Kathleen Tank, who said bicyclists like the short distances between
towns on the Interurban Trail.</p>
<p>&quot;People like it because they don't have to make a big deal about it,&quot;
she said. &quot;My daughter is 18, and sometimes she and her friends ride
from Cedarburg to Port Washington for lunch and back again.&quot;</p>
<p>In the marina, I watched a covey of ducklings and men being photographed
with large catches of salmon. Back on the trail, I passed steep wooden
steps that led to the blufftop 1860 light tower and museum and the
imposing St. Mary's, an 1884 Gothic Revival church.</p>
<p>From Port Washington, the trail to <em>Belgium</em> is straight and flat,
perfect for in-line skating. From there, it continues across the county
border to <em>Oostburg</em> , but bicyclists also can take a county road three
miles east to Harrington State Park and its Lake Michigan beach.</p>
<p>Cedarburg makes a good base for bicyclists; for more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/cedarburg-wisconsin/">Jolly
Cedarburg</a>.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The Interurban was a great trail, but I found an even better one the
next day, almost by accident. Riding past the Milwaukee Art Museum, I
decided to take a spin on the <a href="https://county.milwaukee.gov/EN/Parks/Explore/Trails/Oak-Leaf-Trail">Oak Leaf
Trail</a>, which I'd thought simply followed parkland along Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>Instead, I found myself riding along a hillside and into a cocoon of
greenery that follows the Milwaukee River under street level.</p>
<p>Yet, I couldn't see the river until I found my way to its banks along
overgrown paths in Riverside Park, across from the Urban Ecology Center;
its shores are so wooded I could spot only one building.</p>
<p>Pedaling north, at street level but surrounded by trees, I had no idea
where I was until the trail dumped me out onto a street. Another cyclist
said I was in the suburb of Whitefish Bay.</p>
<p>Following his advice, I rode Hampton Avenue east to Lake Michigan, where
<em>Lake Drive</em> took me past a string of baronial manors that made those on
Summit Avenue look like starter houses.</p>
<p>Trying to catch a view of the lake, I got my wish in Atwater Park, a
blufftop garden with a sweeping panorama and paved trails that wind down
to a wide, sandy beach.</p>
<p>Just over the city's border with Shorewood, I rejoined the Oak Leaf
Trail in Lake Park and swooped down to the lakefront, watching a
freighter on the lake as I rode back to the art museum and downtown.</p>
<p>The next day, I went to the visitors center to beg for a bike map and
found out the Oak Leaf Trail actually is a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/585dc303c697915403a06987/attachments/5e9ef8762c7d3a7e9aeb5433/2020-OLT-parksexplorer.pdf">giant network of
routes</a>, with 100 miles of off-road trail on eight branch lines that also link
to other city, county and state trails.</p>
<p>In the city, the longest sections go north from downtown along the lake
and the Milwaukee River and south along the lake from South Shore Park.</p>
<p>Like Minneapolis' Grand Rounds, the trail circles the city on parkways,
following Lake Michigan and the Milwaukee, Menomonee and Root rivers; on
its north edge, it connects to the <em>Interurban Trail</em> .</p>
<p>Milwaukee is amazingly low-key and easy to navigate on a bicycle. In
summer, I like to stay at Marquette University's Straz Tower, where I
take my bike up to my room on the elevator.</p>
<p>If you don't have your own bike, you can rent a <a href="https://bublrbikes.org/">Bublr
bike</a>.</p>
<p>From Marquette, it's a straight shot down Wisconsin Avenue to the
lakefront.</p>
<p>One July, I rode to Maier Festival Park and the nearby <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/lakeshore/">Lakeshore State
Park</a>, where you can
camp if you've got your own boat.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_red_lighthouse_bicycle.jpg" alt="A bicyclist on the Milwaukee lakefront." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Hank Aaron Trail passes the Pierhead Light near Lakeshore State
Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The white 1926 Breakwater Light sits at the harbor entrance, and it was
a short ride to the 1907 cylindrical red Pierhead Lighthouse on the
<a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/hankaaron/">Hank Aaron State Trail</a>, which connects the Oak Leaf Trail to Miller Park and the county line.</p>
<p>Riding the Oak Leaf Trail on the bluff over newly spiffed-up Bradford
Beach, I passed the recently restored 1887 <a href="http://www.northpointlighthouse.org/visit">North Point
Lighthouse</a> ; it's open
Saturdays and Sundays from 1 to 4 p.m. Who knew Milwaukee had so many
classic lighthouses?</p>
<p>On the west bluff of the Milwaukee River north of downtown, I rode
through Kilbourn Reservoir Park, created after the removal of a
135-year-old underground reservoir.  It has a great view of downtown.</p>
<p>I crossed the Milwaukee River on the Marsupial Bridge, a
pedestrian/biking bridge that hangs from the Holton Street Viaduct like
a baby kangaroo.</p>
<p>It connects the <a href="http://lakefrontbrewery.com/">Lakefront Brewery</a> and
Beerline B neighborhood to Brady Street and the Riverwalk.</p>
<p>Then it was a quick spin to the Cathedral Square neighborhood and the
Bastille Days festival, where I parked my bike near a miniature Eiffel
Tower.</p>
