<h2>This state's long, paved trails draw eager riders from around the nation.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanesboro_bike_spring.jpg" alt="Bicycling on the Root River Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>For Minnesota bicyclists, there are two seasons: winter and trail
construction.</p>
<p>That's a good thing, because bicycle tourists crave more trails, and
towns crave more bicycle tourists.</p>
<p>Bicyclists love Minnesota's paved trails, and towns have discovered
that a little ribbon of asphalt can put it on the map.</p>
<p>&quot;In our area, it seems one city after another is fighting for trails,&quot;
said longtime Stearns County parks advocate Chuck Wocken.</p>
<p>Stearns County's 28-mile Lake Wobegon Trail, opened in 1998, soon grew
to 36 miles, then 46, then 50, then 62.</p>
<p>Now, when linked with the Central Lakes Trail and 10 miles of trail in
Morrison County, it's a network of 137 miles.</p>
<p>The longest continuous trail-and the longest paved trail in the
nation-is the 123-mile Paul Bunyan State Trail. When linked to the
Heartland and Migizi trails, it's part of a 165-mile network.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The long trails give Minnesota bragging rights, but it takes at least a 
weekend to ride them.</p>
<p>Most people want to pedal 20 or 30 miles at a time, usually to enjoy the
scenery or to see towns and attractions along the way.</p>
<p>And everyone likes novelty. Whenever I ride a new trail, that one
becomes my favorite-the Wobegon, for its churches; the Mesabi, for
its curves and emerald-green mine-pit lakes; the Central Lakes, for its
wildlife.</p>
<p>And in Minneapolis, the Grand Rounds packs in more scenery (and
ice-cream stops) than any other trail in the state.</p>
<p>Minnesota is the nation's third most <a href="https://bikeleague.org/bfa/awards">bike-friendly
state</a>, according to the League of
American Bicyclists, and has 32 cities that have earned
&quot;bicycle-friendly&quot; status, more than any other state except
California.</p>
<p>For user reviews of trails, check the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy's
<a href="http://www.traillink.com/">TrailLink</a> site.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/map.html">Minnesota's touring trails</a></h3>
<p><em>Before you go</em> : Always check the trail's website to see if road
construction or flooding has closed part of the trail.</p>

<p><em>Staying safe:</em> Wear a helmet, even though you're off-road. You're
much more likely to fall on your head by locking wheels with another
bike or by stopping suddenly than you are to be hit by a vehicle.</p>
<p><em>Fixing problems</em> : Minnesota has installed more than 30 <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/tuneup/index.html">tune-up
stations</a>, including air
pumps, on 20 trails. In southeast Minnesota, the Root River State Trail
has six stations.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/browns_creek/index.html">Brown's

: East of St. Paul, this six-mile trail starts from the midsection of
the popular, 18-mile <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/gateway/index.html">Gateway State
Trail</a>,
following a trout stream and gently descending through wooded bluffs to
the St. Croix River and <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/st-croix-valley/historic-stillwater-minnesota/">downtown
Stillwater</a>.</p>
<p><em><a href="http://www.cannonvalleytrail.com">Cannon Valley:</a></em> This 19½-mile trail
between Cannon Falls and Red Wing is one of the most popular in the
state. It's a beautiful, shady ride above the Cannon River with a
picnic area in Welch, its midpoint.</p>
<p>The trail can be crowded on weekends. In Red Wing, catch the trail off
Bench Street, near Pottery Place, or 1½ miles north, off U.S. 61.</p>
<p>The trail is maintained by an association; a daily <a href="https://cannonvalleytrail.com/product/2021-daily-wheel-pass/">Wheel
Pass</a> is
$5.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/central_lakes/index.html">Central
Lakes</a>
: It's a 55-mile cruise through rolling landscape dotted with lakes,
often on raised beds that give cyclists good views of the countryside
from Fergus Falls to Osakis, where it connects with the Lake Wobegon
Trail.</p>

<p>Osakis has the best ice-cream stop and a city beach, and the 10½ miles
into downtown Alexandria include prairie and lake scenery.</p>
<p>From Alexandria, many people like the six-mile stretch to Garfield, but
it includes industrial sites.</p>
<p>The 13 miles from Brandon to Ashby pass many lakes and bogs, with lots
of wildlife sightings. It's eight miles to Dalton and another eight to
DeLagoon Park in Fergus Falls, all lined with lakes.</p>

<p>Many people like to start the Gateway in Oakdale, just off Minnesota 36
in the 55th Avenue lot on the south side of at Hadley Avenue, where the
trail briefly parallels the highway before it heads into the
countryside.</p>

: This 13-mile paved trail connects the southeast Minnesota towns of
Plainview, Elgin and Eyota and is near Whitewater and Carley state
parks.</p>
<p>The eight miles from the southern trailhead, just north of Eyota at the
junction of Minnesota 42 and County Road 9, are lovely, following a
winding creek. The five miles from Elgin to Plainview are slightly
uphill and follow the highway.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/blufflands/harmony_preston.html">Harmony-Preston
Valley:</a>
From Isinours Junction, 4½ miles west of Lanesboro on the Root River
State Trail, this 18-mile trail goes through Preston and up to the farm
town of Harmony.</p>
<p>The 5½ miles from Isinours Junction to Preston, which follow the South
Branch of the Root River, are shady and among the prettiest of the whole
system. From Preston, the trail follows Camp Creek and also is
beautiful.</p>
<p>The last third of the trail, up to Harmony, passes through pockets of
forest on the edge of fields and is up and down, with grades of up to 8
percent. Half a mile from Harmony, there's a sinkhole with an
interpretive exhibit.</p>

<p>**<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/heartland/index.html">Heartland**:</a> There
are lots of towns to explore on this 47-mile ride between Park Rapids to
Cass Lake, through Walker. Dorset, an odd little oasis that has as many
restaurants as houses, is a tourist destination. Nevis has shops, cafes
and a city beach on Lake Belle Taine.</p>
<p>Akeley is the home of the state's biggest Paul Bunyan, on whose
outstretched hand people pose for pictures. Just east of Akeley, the
Paul Bunyan State Trail joins the Heartland, and they share the shady
stretch to Walker, passing bogs and lakes.</p>
<p>On the west end of Walker, the trail goes under Minnesota 371, and a
short spur deposits bicyclists in front of Chase on the Lake hotel and
the municipal docks on Leech Lake. On the other side of downtown,
there's a sand beach in City Park.</p>
<p>From Walker, the trail follows the western shore of Leech Lake and
continues to Cass Lake, much of it near the highway but usually shielded
by vegetation.</p>

13-mile spur to Holdingford and another 10 miles across the Mississippi
River to U.S. 10, where it connects to the gravel Soo Line Trail north
of Royalton.</p>
<p>In Osakis, the Lake Wobegon connects to the 55-mile Central Lakes

in St. Joseph, just west of St. Cloud, is a good place to start.</p>
<p>Avon, eight miles west of St. Joseph, also is a good place to start, and
the city beach on Middle Spunk Lake is a good place to take a dip after

are grades of up to 8 percent), are very scenic.</p>
<p>On the north side of Minnesota 34, 2½ miles east of Akeley, the Bunyan
joins the Heartland State Trail for the 7¾-mile ride to Walker.</p>
<p>From Walker, the Bunyan heads northwest to Bemidji. The 7½-mile stretch
along the east edge of Lake Bemidji to Bemidji State Park is very
scenic, crossing the Mississippi River as it leaves the lake and heads
east.</p>
<p>It's also possible to continue around Lake Bemidji on quiet roads and
city sidewalks. The whole loop is a <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/bemidji-bicycling/">very nice 17-mile
ride</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.co.blue-earth.mn.us/dept/parks/redjacket.php">Red Jacket</a> :
This county trail heads 6½ miles from Mankato's South Riverfront Drive
to Rapidan. At County Road 90, it bisects the eight-mile South Route
Trail; from there, it's about four miles to Minneopa State Park.</p>
<p>The Minnesota River Trail, which connects the Red Jacket and Sakatah
Singing Hills State Trail, is about four miles.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/blufflands/root_river.html"><strong>Root River</strong>:</a>
This 42-mile trail, in lovely bluff country between Fountain and
Houston, is Minnesota's pride and joy.</p>
<p>There's a long downhill from Fountain to Isinours Junction, from which
the trail follows the Root River, crossing dozens of bridges as it goes
through Lanesboro, Whalan, Peterson and Rushford.</p>
<p>From there, the trail departs from abandoned rail line and becomes
especially scenic, climbing a steep hill on its way to Houston, where
the Houston Nature Center offers showers.</p>
<p>Much of it is shady, and the area's lack of standing water means there
are few mosquitoes.</p>
<p>It connects to the 18-mile Harmony-Preston Valley Trail west of
Lanesboro at Isinours Junction. Together, the two trails are known as
the Bluffland Trail.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/sakatah/index.html">Sakatah Singing Hills:</a></strong> This
low-profile, 39-mile trail between Faribault and Mankato has a mixture
of scenery. Between Faribault and Waterville, it skirts lakes along a
shady corridor.</p>
<p>From there, it plunges into cool woods, passing Sakatah Lake State Park
(Sakatah is Ojibwe for &quot;singing hills&quot;; it's pronounced Sah-KAH-tah)
and Elysian, where flocks of pelicans hang out on Lake Elysian.</p>
<p>West of Madison Lake, the trail is away from the highway but on open
fields.</p>
<p>In Faribault, start off County Road 21, on the south side of the Cannon
River, or along Minnesota 60 just west of I-35. In Mankato, the
trailhead is on Minnesota 22, near its junction with U.S. 14.</p>
<p>The lakes are pretty but shallow; in late summer, they can be full of
algae, making swimming unpleasant.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shootingstartrail.org/">Shooting Star</a> : This 30-mile
southern Minnesota trail follows the <a href="https://scenicbyways.info/byway/2241.html">Shooting Star Scenic
Byway</a> from LeRoy, on the
Upper Iowa River near the Iowa border, to the east side of Austin, just
south of Hormel Nature Center, where it connects to city trails.</p>
<p>The eastern half, which goes through Lake Louise State Park, is most
scenic. Adams has a public outdoor pool, a park and a cafe.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.exploreminnesota.com/things-to-do/2569/soo-line-trail/">Soo
Line</a></strong>
: The 11-mile Soo Line Trail cuts through countryside on Mille Lacs'
south shore, between the old depot behind Onamia's Main Street to the
playing field in Isle.</p>
<p>From Onamia, it's a six-mile ride on County Road 26/27 to Mille
Lacs-Kathio State Park. In Isle, Father Hennepin State Park adjoins the
town, and riders can use its beautiful lakeside trails and beach.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, riders on the adjoining ATV trail spew gravel and rocks,
some of them palm-size, onto the trail.</p>

Prairie</a> /
<a href="https://www.co.washington.mn.us/index.aspx?NID=506">Hardwood Creek</a></strong> :
These county trails, just north of the Twin Cities, roughly follow
Interstate 35.</p>
<p>The prettiest stretch is the 10 miles from Stacy to North Branch on the
16-mile Sunrise Prairie Trail, which winds past bucolic meadows and
wetlands and is out of earshot of the highway. It's flat and ideal for
children, and there's a playground in Stacy.</p>
<p>The Sunrise Prairie continues south from Wyoming and meets Washington
County's Hardwood Creek Regional Trail, which follows U.S. 61 for 9½
miles from Forest Lake to Hugo.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/willard_munger/index.html">Willard
Munger</a>
: This 75-mile trail between Hinckley and Duluth is one of the oldest
and longest paved trails in the nation.</p>
<p>The stretch from Hinckley to Barnum is known as the Fire Trail, as it
passes through countryside scorched by the cataclysmic Hinckley Fire of
1894 and Cloquet and Moose Lake Fire of 1918, each of which killed more
than 400 people.</p>
<p>The trail starts in Hinckley near the Fire Museum and continues to
Willow River along a rail corridor that was the scene of a dramatic
rescue. From Barnum, the trail follows Minnesota 61 into Carlton.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/munger-bicycle-trail-minnesota/">The Fire Ride</a>.</p>
<p>The next 14½ miles, through gorgeous Jay Cooke State Park, along the St.
Louis River and downhill to the Duluth trailhead, in front of the Lake
Superior Zoo, may be the most scenic stretch of trail in the state.</p>
