<h2>Minnesota's capital city has its own set of marquee trails on rivers and lakes.</h2>

<p>Minneapolis, having once been named Bicycling magazine's No. 1 best city
for bicycling, is better known for bicycling than St. Paul.</p>
<p>As usual, St. Paul is overshadowed by its larger twin. But you'd never
guess it from the throngs of bicyclists on the popular Gateway State
Trail, on Summit Avenue through town and on the St. Paul Classic tour,
started 12 years before the Minneapolis Bike Tour and the state's
largest bike tour.</p>
<p>Like Minneapolis, the capital city has paved trails around lakes, past
historic landmarks and along the Mississippi.</p>
<p>But it's only on the St. Paul side that bicyclists get to go by a giant
snowman.</p>
<p>Every September, thousands of cyclists are introduced to these trails on
the St. Paul Classic, which connects the river to parkways around lakes
Phalen and Como and, on the short route, to the Victorian mansions of
Summit Avenue.</p>
<p>Summit is the St. Paul equivalent of Minneapolis' Midtown Greenway,
cutting west-east from the Mississippi to the Capitol and downtown.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's got a wide bike lane and can be used to make loops with other
trails, including the Big Rivers Regional Trail from Mendota, at the
confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota across from Fort Snelling.</p>
<p>This 22-mile route starts at the state's oldest church, in the former
fur-trade hub of Mendota, and heads along the side of the bluffs, lined
with historical markers.</p>
<p>This could be the most scenic stretch of trail in the state; bicyclists
heading north get great views of the river and downtown St. Paul before
they descend to the shady woods of the Lilydale floodplain and pass the
St. Paul Yacht Club.</p>
<p>You'll come out on Harriet Island, where St. Paul holds many of its
festivals, including Irish Fair in August.</p>
<p>Cross the Wabasha Bridge and continue along the river or head west along
Kellogg Boulevard, past the Science Museum of Minnesota, and up to
Summit Avenue past the Cathedral of St. Paul and James J. Hill House.</p>
<p>It's hard to find a route anywhere in the state that passes as many
historic sites. For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/mississippi-river-bicycling-twin-cities/">Twin Cities history
ride</a>.</p>
<p>But the most-used trail in Minnesota is the Gateway, which is strong on
scenery.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stpaul_gateway_snowman.jpg" alt="Snowman on the Gateway Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In North St. Paul, the Gateway Trail passes a giant snowman.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It starts north of downtown in the shadow of 35E, but people hop on at
many places as it heads east, passing Phalen Park and the giant snowman
in North St. Paul before heading into countryside near the Fleet Farm in
Oakdale.</p>
<p>Then, it's all lakes, wetlands and winding trail through forest,
occasionally alongside riders on horseback. The trail ends in Pine Point
Park, easy striking distance of Square Lake and Marine on St. Croix.</p>
<p>At the north end of Lake Phalen, the Gateway crosses the Bruce Vento
Trail, which heads south to Swede Hollow and the nifty Bruce Vento
Nature Sanctuary.</p>
<p>The other end of this six-mile trail is in downtown St. Paul, near Mears
Park and the St. Paul Farmers Market. This is an industrial but historic
part of St. Paul, and the nature sanctuary is a hidden gem.</p>
<p>It's a former rail yard and, before that, site of the 1853 North Star
Brewery, eventually bought by Jacob Schmidt.</p>
<p>But the Dakota lived there first, and according to explorer Jonathan
Carver in 1766, etched figures on the sandstone walls of the cave they
called Wakan Tipi, or Spirit House.</p>
<p>Today, it's full of wildflowers. Six plaques explain the history.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From the sanctuary, the trail heads north to Swede Hollow, once full of
shacks that were home to the immigrants who worked in Hamm's Brewery,
which still looms over the park.</p>
<p>It continues through a light-industrial area before hitting Lake Phalen,
whose west shore it follows on a pretty stretch lined by lots of
wildflowers, willows and little bridges.</p>
<p>At Parkway Drive, it connects with the Gateway State Trail. You can use
that to head east toward Stillwater or west toward Lake Como and
Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Or, you can circle Round Lake in Phalen Park, then head back to downtown
St. Paul on the east shore of Lake Phalen.</p>
<p>With so many rivers, parkways and off-road trails in the Twin Cities,
everything's connected.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Bicycling in and around St. Paul</h3>
<p><em>Events</em> : The <a href="http://www.bikeclassic.org/">St. Paul Classic</a> bike
tour, always on the Sunday after Labor Day, hits most of the highlights
in the city and is on mostly traffic-free streets. It's a lot of fun,
with live music and treats at frequent rest stops.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stpaul_gateway_trail.jpg" alt="Lake on the Gateway Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Gateway Trail passes several small lakes.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The start and finish is at the University of St. Thomas, near Summit
Avenue and the Mississippi River.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/gateway/index.html">Gateway State
Trail</a> :
This paved, 18-mile trail from St. Paul to Pine Point Park in Stillwater
Township is very popular with in-line skaters, runners and walkers as
well as bicyclists.</p>
<p>The western trailhead starts from Cayuga Avenue and I-35E (from the
Pennsylvania Avenue exit just north of downtown, head .4 mile north).</p>
<p>The often-shady trail passes ponds, wetlands and Phalen Park. At Mile 7,
bicyclists pass the giant snowman in North St. Paul (across from the
high school, whose teams are the Polars).</p>
<p>Many people park at Mile 8.5 in the trail lot at the southeast corner of
Hadley Avenue and Minnesota 36 in Oakdale. There's a porta-potty and
water fountain.</p>
<p>From there, the trail heads north for nearly 10 miles of non-stop
country scenery. At the end, Pine Point Park has bathrooms, water and
picnic tables.</p>
<p>However, bicyclists also can head east to Stillwater on the paved,
six-mile <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/browns_creek/index.html"><strong>Brown's Creek State
Trail</strong></a>. Built along the route of the old Minnesota Zephyr excursion train, it
follows a trout stream and gently descends through wooded bluffs to the
St. Croix River.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/i/lilydale_cliffs_bicyclist.jpg" alt="Biking on the Big Rivers trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Big Rivers Regional Trail winds along the Mississippi River past
sandstone cliffs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For those who continue to Pine Point Park, it's only four miles to
Washington County's Square Lake Park, which is one of the Twin Cities'
best swimming lakes. Ride north on Norell Avenue, then east on Square
Lake Trail.</p>
<p>Another popular destination is the St. Croix River village of <a href="http://marine.govoffice.com/">Marine on
St. Croix</a>. From Square Lake, head north
on St. Paul Avenue/County Road 7, then east on Nason Hill Road/County
Road 7.Â  Warning: The ride back starts with a very steep hill.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ramseycounty.us/sites/default/files/Parks%20and%20Recreation/Regional%20Trail%20Maps%20-%20Bruce%20Vento.pdf"><strong>Bruce Vento
Trail</strong></a>
: You can latch onto this eight-mile trail, named for the late
environmentalist congressman from St. Paul, at several points.</p>
<p>If you're riding along the river from other trails, you can start off
Kellogg Boulevard at Broadway Street, two blocks southeast of Mears
Park.</p>
<p>Turn right on Fifth Street, then right on John Street, and go under the
Lafayette Bridge and along Fourth Street to the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/ventosanctuary.htm">Bruce Vento Nature
Sanctuary</a>.</p>
<p>Or, start at Swede Hollow just off Payne Avenue and Seventh Street,
where there's a parking area, and head north, turning toward <a href="http://www.stpaul.gov/facilities.aspx?page=detail&amp;RID=81">Phalen
Park</a> at
Johnson Parkway.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.co.dakota.mn.us/parks/parksTrails/BigRivers/Pages/default.aspx">Big Rivers Regional
Trail</a>
loop</strong> . This 4Â½-mile Dakota County trail starts in Mendota and follows
the sandstone river bluffs, often with great views of the river and
downtown St. Paul, before descending to the floodplain in Lilydale.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Paved trails continue to downtown St. Paul, and it's easy to make a
22-mile loop by crossing the river and taking the Samuel Morgan Regional
Trail to the riverside trails in <a href="http://www.ci.stpaul.mn.us/Facilities.aspx?page=detail&amp;RID=26">Crosby Farm Regional
Park</a>,
<a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/hidden_falls.htm">Hidden Falls Regional
Park</a> and along
Mississippi Boulevard.</p>
<p>Cross the Ford Parkway bridge to Minnehaha Park, take the Fort Snelling
Trail to Fort Snelling and return to Mendota on the Mendota Bridge.</p>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/mississippi-river-bicycling-twin-cities/">Twin Cities history
ride</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dot.state.mn.us/bike/mrt/maps.html"><strong>Mississippi River
Trail</strong></a>. The first
signs of this developing 3,000-mile trail, also called U.S. Bicycle
Route 45, have appeared around downtown St. Paul on previously unnamed
stretches of bike trail.</p>
<p>For an 18-mile loop, park at the north end of Hidden Falls Regional Park
in St. Paul, just north of the Highway 5 and Mississippi River
Boulevard. Head south through thatÂ  park and Crosby Farm to I-35.</p>
<p>Cross I-35 with the underpass. At Randolph, turn toward the river on the
Samuel Morgan Regional Trail.</p>
<p>At Jackson Street, use city streets to cross the Wabasha Bridge or
continue along the Lower Landing to watch the barge and tugboat traffic
and return at the Childs turnoff (this adds three miles to the route).</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stpaul_classic_como.jpg" alt="Saint Paul Classic." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Bicycle Alliance</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bicyclists pass the Como Park pavilion during the Saint Paul Classic.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Across the Wabasha Bridge, continue on the Big Rivers route (see above).
On the west end of the Mendota Bridge, ride between the officer quarters
and fort to steps that lead to the Highway 5 bridge. Cross, turn left
and ride to the north gate of Hidden Falls.</p>
<h3>Getting to St. Paul trails from Minneapolis</h3>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/grand-rounds/">Biking in Minneapolis</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-minneapolis-st-paul/">Bicycling
west of Minneapolis</a>.</p>
<p>The very popular 5Â½-mile <a href="http://www.midtowngreenway.org/">Midtown
Greenway</a>, operated by a nonprofit
coalition, cuts across south Minneapolis from Bde Maka Ska to the
Mississippi River. It's paved and uses an above-street railroad trestle
from the river through the Seward neighborhood, paralleling 27th Street.</p>
<p>At the river end, bicyclists can connect to St. Paul's parkways by
heading either south to the Lake-Marshall Bridge or north to the
Franklin Bridge.</p>
<p>To reach <strong>Summit Avenue</strong>, head south to
the Lake-Marshall Bridge, cross and head south along the river parkway.
To reach the <strong>Big Rivers Regional Trail</strong>,
don't cross; keep going south to Minnehaha Park.</p>
<p>To reach the <strong>Gateway State Trail</strong>, ride
north to the Franklin Bridge. Cross and follow 27th Avenue S.E. across
University Avenue to 4th Street S.E., just east of the new University of
Minnesota stadium.</p>
<p>Just to the north, the <strong>University of Minnesota Transitway</strong>
for buses and bicycles makes for an easy
ride to the State Fairgrounds. The first part now has been claimed by
the Central Corridor light-rail line, but ride east on 4th Street and
catch the transitway off 30th Avenue.</p>
<p>From there, it's an easy ride to Como Avenue.</p>
<p>Follow Como Avenue to the southeast corner of <strong>Lake Como</strong>. From there,
it's a three-mile ride on <strong>Wheelock Parkway</strong> to connect with the
<em>Gateway State Trail</em> , three blocks east of I-35 (this is not a
trailhead; you'll have to carry bikes up a dirt path to the overpass).</p>
<h3>Nearby state trails</h3>
<p>Across the St. Croix River from Taylors Falls, Minn., 15 minutes north
of Stillwater, the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/gandydancer/">Gandy Dancer State
Trail</a> heads north from
St. Croix Falls, Wis.</p>
<p>For more about St. Croix Falls and the Gandy Dancer trail, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/stcroix-falls/">Trail
mix</a>.</p>
<p>Just to the south, the new Stower Seven Lakes trail heads east from
Dresser to Amery.</p>
