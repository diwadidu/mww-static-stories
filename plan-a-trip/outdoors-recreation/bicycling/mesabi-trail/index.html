<h2>In northern Minnesota, Mesabi Trail draws bicyclists with scenery and machinery.</h2>

<p>The Iron Range never has been for anyone who didn't want to sweat.</p>
<p>Ever since iron ore was discovered on the shores of Lake Vermilion, this
strip of Minnesota has drawn people who wanted to work.</p>
<p>One of the world's richest deposits of iron ore lay under the forest,
and waves of Finns, Slovenes, Italians, Swedes, Croatians, Poles,
Germans and Serbs came to shovel it out.</p>
<p>On the Vermillion Range, hard ore lay in vertical shafts, and the Soudan
mine near Ely eventually reached seven football fields into the Earth.</p>
<p>To the south, softer ore lay along a wooded ridge of hills, an exposed
stretch of the Laurentian Divide that the Ojibwe called the sleeping
giant, or Mesabi.</p>
<p>The Mesabi Range runs nearly 120 miles, from just east of Grand Rapids
to Hoyt Lakes, and its ore could be dug out of open pits.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The miners worked hard to move all that rock. Their labor also built
dozens of towns, helped the nation win two world wars and made mine
owners very rich.</p>
<p>The Rangers didn't get rich, but their lives were enriched by their
fellow miners' cultural contributions: polka from the Poles, progressive
politics from the Finns, walnut potica from the Slovenes.</p>
<p>Today, the Iron Range is one of the most interesting but overlooked
parts of Minnesota. It has natural lakes as well as mine-pit lakes,
which often are lovelier — emerald-green, lined with red cliffs and
stocked with trout.</p>
<p>It offers tours of played-out mines as well as views of working mines.
Its kitchens make dishes found nowhere else in the state — pasties,
potica, sarma.</p>
<p>And now, it has the Mesabi Trail.</p>
<p>This asphalt-paved bicycle trail, like the Range itself, isn't for
sissies. Only part of it lies along abandoned rail lines; the rest
climbs hills and dips and dodges around an intriguing mix of natural and
manmade topography — bogs and slag heaps, rock cuts and aromatic
stands of pine.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/i/hibbing_mesabi_trail2.jpg" alt="Bicyclists on the Mesabi Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Hibbing, bicyclists pass a giant slag heap, one of many along the
Mesabi Trail.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Birds, it turns out, like this landscape: Osprey nest on power poles at
the edge of old mine pits, peregrine falcons perch along their red
cliffs, and loons have taken up residence on the quiet lakes.</p>
<p>This area always has been part of Minnesota's beautiful north woods —
there just happened to be money buried under the trees. That's why,
today, bicyclists will round a corner to see a lovely clump of
wildflowers — with an abandoned steam shovel planted in the middle of
them.</p>
<p>Muscle-powered vehicles weren't found on the Range until recently; it's
more the habitat of 300,000-pound dump trucks, one of which can be seen
just off the trail at Virginia's Mineview in the Sky.</p>
<p>But in the early 1990s, a citizens group in Itasca County began talking
about a trail, about the same time the St. Louis &amp; Lake Counties
Regional Railroad Authority was thinking about extending its North Shore
Scenic Railroad up to the Range.</p>
<p>The rail authority quickly decided to concentrate on a trail instead; it
joined forces with the Itasca County group, the Itasca County Rail
Authority and other citizens groups.</p>
<p>They came up with a dream route — 132 miles, past every Iron Trail
attraction and state park between Grand Rapids and Ely — and hired Bob
Manzoline to be St. Louis &amp; Lake Counties rail authority director and
oversee the creation of the Mesabi Trail.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It seemed to be a Sisyphean task — the part of the route now finished
or under construction includes 700 parcels of property, much of it owned
by absentee mining corporations.</p>
<p>But amazingly, Manzoline and a citizen's committee have assembled enough
land and cobbled together enough federal, state, regional, county and
local grants to build 90 miles of paved trail.</p>
<p>The first time I rode the trail, I started from Virginia. Just south of
town, the trail passed the Village of Franklin, the site of six towns,
or &quot;locations,&quot; that by 1948 had been consumed by the Rouchleau Mines.</p>
<p>The mines started shipping ore in 1893 and soon became one of the many
Minnesota mines swept into the financial empires of John D. Rockefeller,
Andrew Carnegie and J. Pierpont Morgan.</p>
<p>A cage at the site provides a view of the 3-mile-long pit — try to
spot the osprey nest — but bicyclists who don't mind an extremely
steep climb can get a better view from Mineview in the Sky, which the
trail soon passes.</p>
<p>They'll have to climb no matter what, past the base of the slag mountain
on which the observation center sits and beyond, through picturesque
rock cuts that rival those on the Carlton and Root River trails.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/o/mountain_iron_mesabi.jpg" alt="Bicyclists on the Mesabi Trail in Mountain Iron." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then the trail emerges onto an elevated berm, with a boggy lake on one
side and mountains of waste rock on the other. From there, it passes a
stand of shimmering popple, a patch of purple aster and beach pea and
Ely Lake, scraped out not by graders but by glaciers.</p>
<p>Coming into Gilbert, I briefly shared the road with trucks from the
ISPAT mine, then cruised down the town's wide main street, lined with
banners bidding welcome in other languages, from &quot;Hallo&quot; to
&quot;Pozdravijeni.&quot;</p>
<p>Squat brick buildings line the wide street. On the edge of town, Lake
Ore-Be-Gone occupies a pit from which three mines shipped out 35 million
tons of ore between 1902 and 1981.</p>
<p>It's next to the Sherwood Forest Campground, from which the trail winds
through woods to Eveleth and Fayal Pond.</p>
<p>From downtown Virginia, the path uses white diamonds to lead bicyclists
through Olcott Park, past the cemetery and up to Mountain Iron, named
for the Merritt brothers' 1890 declaration that they had discovered &quot;a
mountain of ore.&quot;</p>
<p>The Merritts shipped the Mesabi's first ore out of Mountain Iron, but
lost their mine to John D. Rockefeller, whose U.S. Steel still owns the
Minntac taconite operation, the world's biggest.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chisholm_ironworld.jpg" alt="The trolley at Minnesota Discovery Center." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Chisholm.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Bicyclists can see it from the park on its edge, where there's a 1910
locomotive, a steam shovel and a little pavilion.</p>
<p>From Kinney, I rode west through a corridor of trees to Buhl, past a
mine-pit lake whose red cliffs reflected off its blue-green waters like
the bands of an agate.</p>
<p>On the other side of town, I passed a rusty Bucyrus Erie steam shovel in
the old Grant location, near an old head frame and an odd apparatus with
a suspended set of tires — artifacts from a world unfamiliar to the
white-collar set.</p>
<p>The trail passes Stubler Beach, on another mine-pit lake, and goes on to
Chisholm, passing a series of grassy pyramidal hills — waste rock,
being reclaimed by nature — and going up a steep 8 percent grade to
the crown of the hill overlooking Chisholm.</p>
<p>It wasn't as hard as swinging a pick axe, but it took some work. Soon,
the trail deposited me in the parking lot of Ironworld, the mining
discovery center, and I went inside for some cold water.</p>
<p>The stretch to Hibbing is fairly flat, but west of Hibbing the trail
climbs.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;It's like riding into the Pyrenees mountains in France,&quot; says the
trail's Doug Schmitz. &quot;It's just amazing — you can see working
taconite mines in the distance; you can see all of St. Louis County up
there.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a heck of a trail — of course, I actually like hills and sharp
corners, and I even like steam shovels in my wildflowers.</p>
<p>Trails that meander sedately through fields and forest, are nice, too,
and on those bicyclists don't have to sweat for their scenery. But I can
tell you one thing: If you ride the Mesabi Trail, you won't be bored.</p>
