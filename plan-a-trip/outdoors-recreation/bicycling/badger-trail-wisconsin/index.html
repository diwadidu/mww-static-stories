<h2>On Wisconsin's Badger Trail, bicyclists bite off as much as they can chew.</h2>

<p>On Wisconsin's Badger State Trail, no one goes home hungry.</p>
<p>Starting from the south edge of Madison, the 40-mile trail plunges into
Little Switzerland, taking bicyclists past a gantlet of cheese shops,
meat markets, bakeries and breweries.</p>
<p>But the Badger is best known for its 1,200-foot-long tunnel, cut through
solid limestone in 1887. It curves in the middle, so bicyclists without
a good flashlight will find themselves in total darkness, their nerves
shot by pigeons bursting out of hidden crannies.</p>
<p>When I rode the trail, I took a little flashlight that wouldn't cut
through a shadow, so Mike Goldsby of Madison, who had just come through,
coached me on following the contours of the tunnel floor.</p>
<p>&quot;It's definitely spookier than the ones on the Elroy-Sparta,&quot; he
said.</p>
<p>The Badger trail runs south to the Illinois border, where it connects
with the Jane Addams Trail and runs another 17 miles to Freeport, Ill.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In Monticello, it connects with the 23-mile Sugar River State Trail,
which runs roughly east-west, between New Glarus and Brodhead.</p>
<p>This is cheese country, but riders will want to sample everything. In
Paoli, at the north part of the trail, we found morel-leek Jack at the
Cheese Cottage. In Belleville, samples of New Glarus Organic Revolution
ale. In Monticello, barbecued pork sandwiches.</p>
<p>New Glarus is seven miles from Monticello on the Sugar River State
Trail. But many bicyclists on the Badger consider it a necessary stop
because of its European-style bakery and its ice-cream and chocolate
shop.</p>
<p>And then there's Monroe, which calls itself Cheese City U.S.A. In
Monroe, the trail slices right by the Swiss Colony outlet.</p>
<p>My husband and I stayed in Monroe, and first we rode the seven miles
from there to the Illinois border, where we watched two baby raccoons
peering at us from the edge of the trail and chatted with Steve Spyrison
of Freeport, who said he'd worked with the Illinois DNR on the Jane
Addams Trail.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/badger_trail_shaded.jpg" alt="Bicyclists on the Badger State Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
North of Monticello, the Badger State Trail is lined by moss-covered
rock walls.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;The stretch up by Monticello and the Sugar River is nice, but I think
this is nicer,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>It was true. South of Monroe, the trail is winding, shaded by trees and
lined by clumps of lavender wood phlox. Just before the state line,
limestone outcroppings begin to appear.</p>
<p>In Monroe, at the corner of Eighth Avenue and Ninth Street, bicyclists
can ride 10 blocks east to pretty Courthouse Square, which is lined by
delis, a bakery, a chocolatier and the famed Baumgartner's Cheese Store
&amp; Tavern.</p>
<p>The trail is straighter and more open between Monroe and Monticello,
which has a cafe that makes homemade pies and a market with a deli that
will wrap up hot sandwiches, fried chicken and baked goods for
bicyclists to eat by the fishing pond in the town park.</p>
<p>More stone slabs appear five miles north of Monticello, heralding the
approach of the Stewart Tunnel, where sweaty bicyclists cool off fast in
the damp, chalky air.</p>
<p>The next town is Belleville, where the West Branch joins the Sugar River
at Lake Belleview, lined by parkland.</p>
<p>North of Belleville, the Badger joins the Ice Age National Scenic Trail.
And now, it connects with the <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/capcity/">Capital City State
Trail</a> in Fitchburg.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Some bicyclists start instead in Paoli, a village of arts studios and
galleries just a mile west of the trail. Of course, it has a cheese
shop. And an organic-meat market. And a sophisticated cafe in an old
creamery overlooking the Sugar River.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the trail ends. But on the Badger, the temptations never
quit.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Riding the Badger State Trail in southern Wisconsin</h3>
<p><em>Getting around:</em> The <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/badger/">Badger State
Trail</a> connects to the
Capital City State Trail in Fitchburg, and the first six miles of the
trail are paved from there to Purcell Road near Paoli, where there's a
parking lot.</p>
<p>The rest of the trail is finely crushed limestone, fine for road bikes.
At the Wisconsin state line, it connects to the <a href="http://janeaddamstrail.com/">Jane Addams
Trail</a>, which continues 17 miles to
Freeport, Ill.</p>
<p>The Stewart Tunnel is closed due to a crumbling ceiling, but cyclists can detour on Tunnel Road.</p>
<p><em>Trail pass:</em> It's $5 daily, $25 annual.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/o/monroe_courthouse_square.jpg" alt="Courthouse Square in Monroe, Wis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Monroe's Courthouse Square is lined with places to eat, including the
famous Baumgartner's Cheese Store & Tavern.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Rentals:</em> Bikes can be rented from the <a href="https://www.swisstown.com/bike-rental">depot in New
Glarus</a>. Reserve in advance.</p>
<p><em>Shuttles</em> : From the depot in New Glarus, local retired folks provide
shuttles, charging by distance. A typical charge is $30 to drop off two
people and their bikes in Brodhead for the ride back to New Glarus.</p>
<p>It's about $40 to drop off two people and their bikes in Monroe for
the 16½-mile ride back to New Glarus on the Badger and Sugar River
trails. Reserve a shuttle in advance by calling the visitor center at
608-527-2095.</p>
<p><em>What to bring:</em> A strong flashlight and a cooler for souvenir cheese,
sausage and pastries.</p>
<p><em>When to go:</em> Many of the towns have festivals that are worth catching,
so plan ahead. Some shops and restaurants are closed Sundays.</p>
<p><em>Where to stay:</em> In Monroe, the <a href="http://super8ofmonroe.com/">Super 8</a>
is two blocks from the trail and has rooms with fridges, a whirlpool and
waffle breakfasts. There's an AmericInn next door.</p>
<p>The nicest place is the Swiss-style <a href="http://www.chaletlandhaus.com">Chalet
Landhaus</a> in New Glarus (on the Sugar
River State Trail), which has a pool complex and sumptuous breakfasts.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cameorose.com">Cameo Rose Victorian Country Inn</a> offers
six rooms and suites near Belleville.</p>
<p>There's camping on the edge of New Glarus in <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/ngwoods/">New Glarus Woods State
Park</a>, 608-527-2335. It
doesn't have showers, but sweaty bicyclists can use showers at the
municipal pool in Village Park next to the depot, open until 8:30 p.m.
Monday-Friday and 8 p.m. Saturday-Sunday.</p>
<p><em>Where to eat:</em> In New Glarus, the Glarner Stube, or the New Glarus
Hotel. In Monroe, Turner Hall and Baumgartner's.</p>
