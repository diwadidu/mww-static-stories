<h2>A bicycle trail connects two eastern Minnesota towns that share a painful past.</h2>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Pedaling along a beautiful state trail in eastern Minnesota, bicyclists
never would guess it once was hell on earth-twice.</p>
<p>In 1894, a 4½-mile-high wall of fire incinerated Hinckley and Sandstone
along the St. Paul &amp; Duluth Railroad line, now the Willard Munger State
Trail.</p>
<p>In 1918, another inferno destroyed Kettle River, Moose Lake and Cloquet.
Hundreds of people died, and dozens of villages were wiped off the map.</p>
<p>Today, the 32-mile stretch of paved trail between Hinckley and Moose
Lake is lined with wildflowers, pine trees and chirping songbirds. But
fire museums in each town tell the tragic, often gruesome stories.</p>
<p>The Hinckley Fire in 1894 is best known and received five days of
front-page coverage in the London Times.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But the 1918 <a href="http://www.mnopedia.org/event/cloquet-duluth-and-moose-lake-fires-1918">Cloquet
Fire</a>
remains the worst single-day natural disaster in Minnesota history, with
453 people burned to death and 4,089 homes destroyed.</p>
<p>Even in Minnesota, few have heard of the 1918 fires, sparked by passing
trains and whipped into an inferno by winds on Oct. 12. From Cloquet, it
spread north at up to 20 mph, reaching the northeast edge of Duluth.</p>
<p>&quot;It happened right when World War I ended, and that got all the
headlines,&quot; says Marlene Berube of the Fires of 1918 Museum in Moose
Lake.</p>
<p>Berube's father was in the local Home Guard, which was charged with
searching for and burying the dead, and he never mentioned it to her.</p>
<p>&quot;My brother said Dad told him once and then said, &quot;I never want to talk
about it again,' &quot; she said.</p>
<p>People in Cloquet were warned and evacuated by train. But many in the
countryside and smaller towns were taken by surprise. They tried to take
refuge in lakes, ditches and root cellars, where many suffocated. The
fire was followed by a cold night.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/i/hinckley_grindstone_river.jpg" alt="Grindstone River in Hinckley." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Just outside Hinckley, the trail crosses the Grindstone River, where
many people took refuge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;Some people laid next to what they thought was a burned log to stay
warm, and the next day they found out it was a human,&quot; Berube said.</p>
<p>The Moose Lake museum is the 1907 Soo Line depot, one of the few
buildings that survived. The Munger Trail runs alongside it, heading
north to Duluth and south to Hinckley.</p>
<p>Named for Willard Munger, a Duluth environmentalist who served 43 years
in the Minnesota House, the trail loosely follows Minnesota 61, the same
highway mythologized in Duluth native Bob Dylan's classic &quot;Highway 61
Revisited.&quot;</p>
<p>Heading south from Moose Lake, it runs through Sturgeon Lake and Willow
River, then veers away from the highway to Finlayson, slicing through
pastoral meadows.</p>
<p>Five miles from Hinckley, a marshy area once was Skunk Lake, scene of a
dramatic rescue in the 1894 fire.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The train from Duluth was approaching Hinckley just as the cyclonic fire
reached it from the south.</p>
<p>With 170 panicked townsfolk who had run north on the tracks, engineer
Jim Root threw it into reverse and backed the flaming train to Skunk
Lake, where the 300 passengers rushed into 18 inches of mud and slime 30
seconds before a wall of flame barreled over them.</p>
<p>Across town at the Eastern Minnesota depot, engineers Edward Best and
Edward Barry had arrived earlier and waited until another 400 people
could pile onto the train. As it left, melting paint ran off its cars,
and the town exploded behind it.</p>
<p>In Hinckley, the green Fire Museum occupies the St. Paul &amp; Duluth depot
that replaced the one that burned in 1894.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had a lot of people ask, 'Is this the same fire as the Moose Lake
one?' &quot; says volunteer Carol Goddard. &quot;Ours was a firestorm, a whole
different story. It's the only documented natural firestorm; Hiroshima
and Dresden were manmade.&quot;</p>

<p>Less than 2 inches of rain fell in the summer of 1894, and many small
fires smoldered in the countryside, many started when hot cinders from
trains landed in tinder-dry wood left behind by logging crews.</p>
<p>Breezes fanned small fires, and they came together. The flames, breaking
through a thick layer of warm air, were turned into a fiery cyclone by
cool air traveling down from above.</p>
<p>In the old freight room, a 19-minute movie tells the dramatic story, and
a fiery mural tells it in images. Exhibits include the rocking chair in
which a child sat, wrapped in wet blankets, as the fire passed over her
in a potato field; her china doll is in an adjoining case.</p>
<p>In the old telegrapher's room, a plaster likeness of 25-year-old Thomas
Dunn sits awaiting Root's train from Duluth, on which members of
Dunn's family were traveling. A tape records his last message: &quot;I
think I've stayed too long.&quot;</p>
<p>A ride on the Munger State Trail is lovely in every season. But people
who have visited the two fire museums may see ghosts amid the scenery.</p>
