<h2>An hour west of Chicago, a scenic bicycle trail makes sightseeing easy.</h2>

<p>For centuries, people have beaten a path along the Fox River:
Pottawatomie Indians, pioneer entrepreneurs, escaped slaves on the
Underground Railroad, city-bound commuters . . . and now, bicyclists.</p>
<p>Thanks to a network of abandoned electric railways, this part of
northeast Illinois is a hotbed of bicycle trails.</p>
<p>They're all popular, but the 40-mile Fox River Trail past St. Charles,
Geneva and Batavia includes an astonishing amount of scenery and
attractions: a Dutch windmill, Japanese gardens and a lighthouse plus
many forest preserves, gazebos and wildlife sightings, mainly herons and
egrets lurking on the shallow river.</p>
<p>Oh, and a whole lot of bakeries, gelato shops, delis and coffeehouses,
all tantalizingly close to the trail.</p>
<p>St. Charles and Geneva are affluent towns and popular weekend
destinations.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Geneva is known for being Swedish, but its posh shops lean French,
judging by LeLa Une Boutique Unique, Le Doggie Divine Spa &amp; Boutique and
the French Market held Sundays.</p>
<p>St. Charles is known for antiques and the fine junque available monthly
at its Kane County Flea Market.</p>
<p>In both towns, millionaires called colonel left their mark.</p>
<p>St. Charles' native daughter Dellora Baker married the man who would go
on to found Texaco. She passed their fortune to her niece, who opened
the Arcada Theatre in 1926, and her horse-racing brother, &quot;Colonel&quot;
Edward Baker, who opened the riverside Hotel Baker in 1928.</p>
<p>Both landmarks have been lovingly restored and still are used.</p>
<p>Col. George Fabyan, a businessman given his honorary title by the
governor, came to Geneva in 1907 and built an estate along the river.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/e/geneva_herrington.jpg" alt="The Herrington Inn in Geneva." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Herrington Inn in Geneva incorporates an 1874 creamery built on the
homestead of the town's founders.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>His Japanese gardens and villa, remodeled by Frank Lloyd Wright, are on
the west bank, and his 1870 Dutch-style windmill is on the east bank.</p>
<p>All of these sights are most easily seen on a bike. In fall, I rode two
sections from St. Charles, a loop south to Geneva, Batavia and Aurora,
and the trail north to Elgin.</p>
<p>Heading south along the east bank, I followed the path as it wove past
riverside parks, one of them Camp Kane, used to train Illinois cavalries
in the Civil War.</p>
<p>In Geneva, I realized my back tire was nearly flat, so I stopped at
Geneva Cycle, where longtime owner Elis Giannini pumped it up for me.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a pretty big biking community,&quot; he said, &quot;There are seven
bike shops in the Tri Cities.&quot;</p>
<p>He gave me his opinion of the prettiest sections of the trail but says
he prefers the Great Western Trail west of St. Charles and &quot;never rides
the section between St. Charles and Batavia because it's full of
idiots.&quot;</p>
<p>Translation: The trail is popular and used by people who are more
interested in sightseeing than exercising. And why not? There's a lot
to see.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Across the bridge, I stopped to watch an egret hunting in front of the
Herrington Inn &amp; Spa, named for Geneva's founders and built around an
1874 creamery on the site of their homestead.</p>
<p>South of Geneva, I saw the first of several covered bike bridges tucked
under the decks of rail and vehicle bridges, impressively functional
pieces of art.</p>
<p>Farther on, an arched pedestrian bridge led to Col. Fabyan's villa and
gardens, which included a little concrete lighthouse at river's edge.</p>
<p>It's amazing that an area only 40 miles from Chicago's Loop has so
many parks and undeveloped space, but it does. On the east bank, it was
all woods and meadow to Batavia, where I rode by the Depot Museum.</p>
<p>There's a Victorian gazebo next to it, with a bronze cupola and
stained-glass sides.</p>
<p>People ice-skate here on a pond formed by a spit of land that reaches
into the river. Riverwalk paths lead to a large gazebo on the north
point, and there's a collection of decorative metal windmills-once,
three companies made water-pumping windmills in Batavia.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/e/geneva_windmill.jpg" alt="The Dutch windmill in Fabyan Forest Preserve." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In 1914, George Fabyan moved a Dutch-style windmill to Geneva.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I continued on the west bank to North Aurora, crossing just below the
dam and returning to Batavia through the dense woods of Red Oak Nature
Center.</p>
<p>Passing the giant chimney of Challenge Windmill &amp; Feed Mill Co., now
office lofts, I soon came to the Fabyan Forest Preserve and the
five-story windmill that Col. Fabyan had moved from a nearby farm in
1914.</p>
<p>The colonel was a character, using an inherited fortune on various
scientific investigations.</p>
<p>His attempt at proving Francis Bacon was the author of Shakespeare's
works didn't pan out, but he established a lab that pioneered modern
cryptography and taught the U.S. military code-breaking skills during
World War I. It operates today as an acoustics facility.</p>
<p>From St. Charles, the trail follows only one side of the river.</p>
<p>Heading north from the striking City Hall, I went by a 15-foot sculpture
of a Pottawatomie Indian dubbed Ekwabet, or &quot;watching over.&quot; Along
with the Sauk and Fox, the Pottawatomie were ejected from the Fox River
Valley after the Black Hawk War of 1832, to make room for a tide of
settlers.</p>
<p>I passed a sculpture made of bicycle parts and dubbed FoxCycle, and then
I was in Pottawatomie Park, the city's playground.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Here, people can climb the extraordinarily ornate tower of a Victorian
pavilion and cruise the river on one of two paddlewheelers that have
been operating since 1946.</p>
<p>From the park, the path climbs to city streets, then dips to river
bottomlands in the Norris Woods Forest Preserve. Then it's a bit of a
roller coaster, going up a road to Tekakwitha Woods Forest Preserve,
then down through woods to the Fox River, where I clattered across two
wooden spans to South Elgin.</p>
<p>There, at the Fox River Trolley Museum, brightly colored cars from the
old railway were awaiting restoration.</p>
<p>Farther on, the trail passes a forest preserve in Dundee and three more
in Carpenterville, but I turned around. On this trail, there's
sightseeing enough for several weekends.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Towns of the Fox River in suburban Chicago</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : The area is an hour west of Chicago and southeast of
Rockford.</p>
<p>Geneva is a stop on the Metra train from Chicago, as are Elgin and
Aurora. Bicycles can be carried onto the train outside rush hours.</p>
