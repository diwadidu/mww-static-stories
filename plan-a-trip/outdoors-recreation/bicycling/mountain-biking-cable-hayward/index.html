<h2>In the forest of northwest Wisconsin, navigate a singular system of singletrack.</h2>

<p>In the forest around Hayward and Cable, it's easy to catch speed fever.</p>
<p>This is where the world's best Nordic skiers compete on the Birkie
Trail, famous for its relentless ups and downs, and mountain bikers race
on the CAMBA trails, known for 270-degree switchbacks and such obstacles
as a boulder called the Volkswagen.</p>
<p>In this pocket of northwest Wisconsin, endurance athletes streak through
Chequamegon National Forest year-round, training for the next big race
on more than 300 miles of marked trails.</p>
<p>So why would this be a good place for a beginner to try mountain biking?
I wondered that myself as I aimed my rented Rockhopper between trees,
around stumps and over boulders.</p>
<p>By the time I figured out that mountain biking is kind of dangerous, I
was already deep into the woods.</p>
<p>There was only one thing to do: Learn fast or crash.</p>
<p>There are trails for beginners, but they're on roads that seem dull once
you've had a taste of singletrack. And it turns out that fat tires
easily handle most stumps and rocks. It's the human brain that needs
steering.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;My golden rule is, if you don't want to run into it, don't look at
it,&quot; said Jodi, one of the friends coaching me. &quot;It's the fear factor
that can get you.&quot;</p>
<p>It was advice that could apply just as well to a tightrope walker. On
the newest section of the 13-mile Makwa Trail, just northeast of
Hayward, it was hard not to fixate on the rocks stacked on the edge of
the trail.</p>
<p>They'd been put there by someone-but why?</p>
<p>We found out at one of the Makwa's many crossings of the Birkie Trail,
where we ran into Harry Spehar, a member of the Chequamegon Area
Mountain Bike Association board. He said the boulders had been taken out
of the trail itself.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't want people to get in trouble,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just not
fun.&quot;</p>
<p>We rode the Birkie Trail, a rolling superhighway of grass, back to the
Gravel Pit trailhead so we could ride west on an older section of the
Makwa Trail. But suddenly, rocks and roots started popping up on the
trail. It was as if we'd made a wrong turn onto a black-diamond trail
from a blue.</p>
<p>That was the point where trail developers had &quot;a different vision,&quot;
said Joel Harrison, one of the owners of New Moon Bike &amp; Ski Shop in
Hayward. He'd rented us our bikes and given us a rundown of trails.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/cable_garmisch_front.jpg" alt="Garmisch Resort near Cable." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>On some trails, such as the Rock Lake Trail near Cable, he said,
builders actually take rocks out of the woods and put them into the
trail. Why?</p>
<p>&quot;For fun, and because it's more challenging,&quot; he said. &quot;There's one
rock that's so big it's called the Volkswagen. You have to do it fast;
otherwise, you'll tip over on the top.&quot;</p>
<p>Others can simply go around it: &quot;I'm not too proud to put my bike on my
shoulder and walk through,&quot; Harrison said.</p>
<p>I was weaving my way through the forest just fine until, for no
discernible reason, my front tire turned and I crashed onto my right
shoulder. But I got up undamaged, except for a macho-looking tattoo of
bicycle-chain grease on my leg.</p>
<p>&quot;You may get scraped up a little and dirty, but you're not going to kill
yourself riding like this,&quot; said our more-experienced friend Susie. &quot;I
always think about riding a road bike at 30 miles per hour, and then
this-you'd have to hit your head in a really unlucky place to kill
yourself at 6 miles an hour.&quot;</p>
<p>We rode nearly 20 miles that day, but it felt like 70.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>For dinner, we drove to Cable for pizzas from the stone oven at The
Rivers Eatery, joining a convivial group that included Gary Crandall,
longtime director of the Chequamegon Fat Tire Festival, and Ned
Zuelsdorff, director of the American Birkebeiner.</p>
<p>The two men are following in the footsteps of legendary promoter Tony
Wise, who turned a little hill into the Mount Telemark ski area in 1947,
brought the Lumberjack World Championships to Hayward in 1960 and, in
1973, started the Birkebeiner, which became North America's biggest
Nordic-skiing race.</p>
<p>In 1983, he helped Crandall start the Fat Tire Festival, which became
the largest mountain-biking event of its kind.</p>
<p>All endeavors in these little backwoods towns tend to be big. In 1949,
two fishermen set world records for the biggest muskies that still
stand, though some think the records should be for biggest fish tales.</p>
<p>In Hayward, a 143-foot-long fiberglass muskie rises above the Namekagon
River at the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall of Fame. Next door, the
town of 2,100 produces world-champion log-rollers and boom-runners at
its Lumberjack Bowl .</p>
<p>Boom running is a lumberjack sport that involves crossing a river on a
bobbing line of logs. It's a lot like riding singletrack, in fact â€”
you'd better keep your balance, or else.</p>

bikers a break from singletrack.

<p>The next day, we rode on trails in the Namakagon &quot;cluster&quot; of trails,
one of six in the CAMBA system. In the parking lot of the Namakagon Town
Hall, 10 miles east of Cable, Scott demonstrated a standing stop,
remaining upright on his bike yet motionless.</p>
<p>&quot;That's good for when the person in front of you has just crashed,&quot;
Susie said helpfully.</p>
<p>Of the nine cars in the lot, only two were from Wisconsin; the rest had
Minnesota plates. CAMBA has been building trail since 1993, and its
well-marked, well-maintained system draws riders from all over the
region and, increasingly, the nation.</p>
<p>We headed south on the Patsy Lake Trail, which was easy singletrack and
grassy doubletrack. It was a beauty, passing lakes and bogs, crossing
beaver dams on boardwalks and taking us through patches of raspberries,
ready for picking.</p>
<p>It still had its share of rocks, however, and when my husband got tired
and coasted, his pedal hit one, twisting his tire and sending him flying
in exactly the same way I had, onto his right shoulder.</p>
<p>That, said Scott, is &quot;normal.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Despite mountain biking's reputation as a testosterone-charged sport, we
saw only couples and families on the singletrack; the only young men we
saw were riding on the wide Birkie Trail.</p>
<p>&quot;In the beginning, it had an outsider status,&quot; said Susie, who bought
her first mountain bike in 1987. &quot;It was to road biking what
snowboarding was to skiing.&quot;</p>
<p>Today, any one can ride. All you have to do is wear a helmet, watch the
trail for rocks and be willing to sweat.</p>
<p>And if you stumble over that learning curve, don't worry: It's normal.</p>
