<h2>On a scenic loop from Minnehaha Park to downtown St. Paul, bicyclists see how it all started.</h2>

In Lilydale, bicyclists ride between the river and sandstone cliffs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the heart of the Twin Cities, one of the most popular bicycling
routes also is the most historic.</p>
<p>Below Fort Snelling, the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers meet. Everyone
came here . . . in the days before trains and cars, everyone <em>had</em> to
come here.</p>
<p>Today, one of the easiest ways to travel this route is by bicycle, and
paved trails line both sides of the Mississippi from Minnehaha Park in
south Minneapolis to downtown St. Paul.</p>
<p>They form a remarkable 22-mile loop on which you can follow in the steps
of the Dakota, fur traders, explorers, soldiers, steamboat captains,
railroad barons, archbishops and famous authors.</p>
<p>There's no better way to spend a day. Find out about the people who
made the Twin Cities what it is today — or just enjoy the scenery.</p>

<h3>Minnehaha Park in Minneapolis</h3>
<p>The city's oldest park, built around the famous Minnehaha Falls, is a
good place to start.</p>
<p>The 53-foot falls on Minnehaha Creek, which connects Lake Minnetonka to
the Mississippi River, has been a tourist attraction since the first
steamboat arrived in 1820.</p>
<p>But it became famous after the 1855 publication of Henry Wadsworth
Longfellow's 'Song of Hiawatha,&quot; and schoolchildren paid for the
Jacob Fjelde's 1911 statue of Hiawatha preparing to carry the maiden
Minnehaha across the water.</p>
<p>If you need a bike, you can rent one at <a href="http://www.wheelfunrentals.com/Locations/Minneapolis-4">Wheel
Fun</a>. You can
pick up maps and information at the adjoining Longfellow House, a
2/3-scale replica of the author's home in Cambridge, Mass., if it's
open.</p>
<p>Ride south from the west side of the park, past the old Princess Depot,
to a paved trail by the dog park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/n/snelling_bicyclist.jpg" alt="Bicycling through Fort Snelling." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A bicyclist rides through Fort Snelling.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's a fast ride down the bluff to the floodplain of <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/fort_snelling/index.html">Fort Snelling
State
Park</a>,
where the Minnesota River flows into the Mississippi.</p>
<p>On an island now named for him, <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/zebulon-pike/">Lt. Zebulon
Pike</a> met on Sept.
23, 1805, with seven Dakota chiefs and got two of them to sign
Minnesota's first treaty.</p>
<p>For 60 gallons of liquor, $200 in trade goods and $2,000 paid to
traders, the federal government received 100,000 acres of what became
Minneapolis and St. Paul, though the Dakota had no idea they'd given it
away.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid a steep climb and also ride through parts of Fort
Snelling, keep to the right and take a trail that parallels Minnesota
55.</p>
<p>You'll pass <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/coldwater-spring.htm">Coldwater Spring</a>, whose waters are considered sacred by the
Dakota and around which the first soldiers and settlers lived.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.mnhs.org/fortsnelling">Historic Fort Snelling</a></h3>
<p>Built on the bluffs over the confluence between 1820 and 1824, this fort
now is operated by the Minnesota Historical Society. In summer and on
Saturdays in September and October, costumed interpreters lead tours and
engage visitors.</p>
<p>Passing through, you'll ride by unused officers' quarters and the
stone Round Tower, built around 1820 and likely the oldest building in
Minnesota.</p>
<p>Now, cross the Mendota Bridge to the village of Mendota, the Dakota word
for &quot;where the waters meet.&quot; Fur trader Jean Baptiste Faribault
moved here after his log cabin on Pike Island flooded, and John Jacob
Astor's American Fur Company built a post here.</p>
<p>Mendota also is the home of Minnesota's oldest church, St. Peter's,
founded in 1840. Its first priest, Father Lucien Galtier, was
responsible for naming St. Paul.</p>
<p>In September, the church hosts the <a href="http://mendotadakota.com/mn/">Mendota Mdewakanton
Dakota</a> powwow on its grounds.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/e/mendota_sibley_house.jpg" alt="Sibley House in Mendota." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Henry Sibley's 1836 house is open for tours in summer.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="https://www.mnhs.org/sibley">Sibley Historic Site</a> in Mendota</h3>
<p>Henry Hastings Sibley was a classic frontier opportunist. He came to
work for the American Fur Company, built connections in the Dakota
community by marrying the granddaughter of a chief, then left her to
marry the daughter of a white business associate.</p>
<p>Later, he enriched himself at treaty negotiations, invested in former
Dakota land and became the state's first governor. He became a general
after the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862, when he led the military commission
that condemned 303 Dakota men to death (reduced to 39 by President
Lincoln).</p>
<p>Today, the 1836 stone house Sibley built is operated by the Minnesota
Historical Society, which holds a fur-trade rendezvous there in July.</p>
<p>Cross the highway to reach the bike trail, or stop for lunch in the
village. Both its restaurants,
<a href="https://axelsrestaurants.com/locations/mendota/">Axel's</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Luckys13Mendota">Lucky 13
Pub</a>, are
along the trail and have pleasant patios.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="http://www.co.dakota.mn.us/parks/parksTrails/BigRivers/Pages/default.aspx">Big Rivers Regional Trail</a></h3>
<p>The 4½-mile trail that follows the river is the most scenic part of the
loop and is lined with interpretive markers. From Mendota, the trail
travels along the bluffs, often with views of the river and downtown St.
Paul in the distance.</p>
<p>Then, it descends to the St. Paul Yacht Club and the wooded floodplain
of <a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/lilydale_park.htm">Lilydale Regional
Park</a>, passing
under the spectacular High Bridge as it approaches Harriet Island.</p>
<p>This section is popular with in-line skaters, too.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.stpaul.gov/index.aspx?NID=278">Harriet Island Regional Park</a> in <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/st-paul-sightseeing/">St. Paul</a></h3>
<p>This park, which isn't an island, is across from downtown. Named for
Harriet Bishop, a teetotaling Baptist teacher who founded the first
public school, it's St. Paul's playground.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.riverrides.com/">Padelford Riverboats</a> offer cruises
from their docks there.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stpaul_showboat.jpg" alt="The Centennial Showboat on the Mississippi." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Its stone Wigington Pavilion is named after the nation's first black
municipal architect, and there's a bandshell used for many festivals,
including <a href="http://www.irishfair.com/">Irish Fair</a> in August.</p>
<p>Ride over the Wabasha Bridge, passing over Raspberry Island, which <em>is</em>
an island and sometimes is used for concerts.</p>
<p>There are two ways to return.</p>
<p>If you want to continue on bike paths along the river, turn right
immediately after crossing the Wabasha Bridge and ride down Second
Street to Jackson, at river level.</p>
<p>Turn right onto Shepard Road and follow the Samuel H. Morgan Regional
Trail along the river. Markers point out historic sites, including the
cave where one-eyed former voyageur Pierre &quot;Pig's Eye&quot; Parrant set
up a tavern.</p>
<p>He was the first white resident of St. Paul. The budding settlement
briefly was known as Pig's Eye, until Father Galtier was able to rename
it.</p>

<p>Continue riding on the bike paths alongside Shepard Road/Mississippi
River Boulevard to Ford Parkway or turn into <a href="https://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/crosfarm.htm">Crosby Farm Regional
Park</a>,
where paved paths follow the river's shores and continue into <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/hidden-falls-regional-park.htm">Hidden
Falls Regional
Park</a>.</p>
<p>Ride up the steep hill to Mississippi Boulevard and on to Ford Parkway
and across the Ford Bridge back to Minnehaha Park.</p>
<p>The other way to return follows city streets.</p>
<p>Turn left onto Kellogg Boulevard and go past the <a href="http://www.smm.org/">Science Museum of
Minnesota</a>, which includes the National Park Service's  <a href="http://www.nps.gov/miss/planyourvisit/hours.htm">Mississippi River
Visitors Center</a>.</p>
<p>Continue on the busy street to the imposing <a href="https://www.mnhs.org/historycenter">Minnesota History
Center</a> and turn onto John
Ireland Boulevard.</p>
<p>Ride up the hill to two <em>very</em> large buildings.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_paul_cathedral.jpg" alt="Cathedral of St. Paul." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Cathedral of Saint Paul was finished in 1915.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="http://www.cathedralsaintpaul.org/">Cathedral of Saint Paul</a> and the <a href="https://www.mnhs.org/hillhouse">James J. Hill House</a></h3>
<p>The most powerful men in town claimed the blufftop overlooking the
river, downtown and the Minnesota Capitol.</p>
<p>Archbishop John Ireland began building the limestone Cathedral of Saint
Paul in 1906. It's the third-largest church in the nation and is open
to the public.</p>
<p>Across the street, James J. Hill built the largest house in Minnesota;
it took 300 people three years to finish.</p>
<p>Hill was a classic self-made man. As a teen-age bookkeeper at the
steamboat landing in St. Paul, he turned a side business selling wood
and coal into a transportation empire that included the Great Northern
Railway.</p>
<p>They called him the Empire Builder, and his old route, now Amtrak's
passenger line across the Great Plains to Seattle, is named for him.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Historical Society operates the house, which is open for
tours and special events year-round.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/st_paul_fitzgerald_rowhouse.jpg" alt="F. Scott Fitzgerald home in St. Paul." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Ave.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/summit-avenue-st-paul/">Summit Avenue</a> and the F. Scott Fitzgerald house</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.mnhs.org/hillhouse">James J. Hill House</a> is only the
biggest mansion of many big mansions on the 4½-mile stretch of Summit
Avenue from the cathedral to the river.</p>
<p>It's considered one of the nation's best-preserved collections of
Victorian homes, though one of F. Scott Fitzgerald's characters called
it &quot;a museum of American architectural failures.&quot;</p>
<p>The Jazz Age novelist grew up around Summit Avenue, but unlike most of
his friends, he was of modest means, and his books reflect his love-hate
relationship with St. Paul's elite.</p>
<p>During the summer of 1919, Fitzgerald completed his first novel, &quot;This
Side of Paradise,&quot; in a townhouse at 599 Summit Ave. He was born nearby
at 481 Laurel Ave.</p>
<p>The staff of the James J. Hill House occasionally offers 75-minute
guided walking tours of Fitzgerald's neighborhood.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_minnehaha_falls_fall.jpg" alt="Minnehaha Falls in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Lauren Gagner</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Minnehaha Park, the falls drop 53 feet.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Continue along Summit Avenue, which has a wide bicycle lane and is a
popular bike route.</p>
<h3>Minnehaha Park and beyond</h3>
<p>When Summit Avenue meets the river, turn south and follow bike paths to
Ford Parkway and Minnehaha Park.</p>
<p>In the park, <a href="https://www.seasaltmpls.com/">Sea Salt Eatery</a> is a very
popular place to eat seafood or have a beer. There's also a concession
selling ice cream and snacks.</p>
<p>From here, you can continue riding north along the river to downtown
Minneapolis, the Stone Arch Bridge and the <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/minneapolis-riverfront/">historic milling
district</a>.</p>
<p>Or, continue west along Minnehaha Creek to the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/minneapolis-chain-lakes/">Chain of
Lakes</a>.</p>
<p>Both trails are part of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/grand-rounds/">Grand Rounds National Scenic
Byway</a>, which forms a loop around Minneapolis.</p>
<p>More trails take bicyclists into the far suburbs of Minneapolis and St.
Paul.</p>
