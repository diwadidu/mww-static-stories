<p>It's easy to see why the Dakota Rail Trail is the most popular bicycle
trail in Minnesota.</p>
<p>This 25½-mile trail between the Minneapolis suburb of Wayazata and rural
Mayer winds through the labyrinthine bays and isthmuses of Lake
Minnetonka better than any car can.</p>
<p>It's shady, scenic and paved, so it's beloved by in-line skaters as
well as bicyclists.</p>
<p>And for those of us from the city, it affords a glimpse of curiously
different lifestyles, one with yachts and country clubs and another with
horses and barns.</p>
<p>The Dakota Rail Trail may or may not be most popular; the Gateway Trail
out of St. Paul is much-used, too. But on a decent day, the parade of
humanity never stops.</p>
<p>The first time we rode the trail, we started in downtown Wayzata on Lake
Street, passing the 1906 railroad depot for James J. Hill's Great
Northern Railway, whose trains brought grain from the Great Plains into
the flour mills of Minneapolis.</p>
<p>They returned with tourists, and before the turn of the century, many
were headed for the two dozen hotels on the shores of Lake Minnetonka.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>A Three Rivers Parks kiosk marks the trailhead next to the city beach.
From there, the trail winds around Shaver Park and follows County Road
15 before ducking into a landscape of lily pads and lakes.</p>
<p>As we passed Tanager Lake at Mile 2, a rider coming from the other end
let us know what we were in for, shouting to his friends, &quot;This trail is
freakin' gorgeous!&quot;</p>
<p>This time, we started on the north shore of Lake Waconia and headed east
on a newer stretch of trail. In St. Bonifacius, a beautiful new bridge
crosses busy Minnesota 7, depositing bicyclists in front of the St. Boni
Bistro.</p>
<p>It was as busy as it was right after the trail opened, when we'd had
lunch there and talked to the owner, an early trail supporter.</p>
<p>When I kidded him about other locals not wanting inner-city riffraff
riding through the fancy lake villages, he confirmed my suspicions: &quot;Oh,
they <em>didn't</em> want you,&quot; he said seriously.</p>
<p>Three years later, we're pretty sure that plenty of the locals are on
the trail. For one thing, we saw them; for another, it's a great way to
get where you're going.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minnetonka_drivein.jpg" alt="Minnetonka Drive-In in Spring Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The trail passes the back yard of the Minnetonka Drive-In.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Not far from St. Boni in Minnetrista, we saw a small sign for Big Stone
Mini Golf and Sculpture Garden and checked it out. The course was
delightfully creative, with thickets of polished logs studding one hole
and a giant art bowl catching balls at another.</p>
<p>A towering patch of sunflowers separated the course from a goat yard,
and heirloom chickens scratched in the dirt near the office, which also
sells organic homemade jams.</p>
<p>We made plans to return so we could play and look around more. There was
no way we would have discovered it if we hadn't been on a bike trail.</p>
<p>On the other side of the trail, a blacktop spur led up to a place we'd
heard about but never visited: Gale Woods Farm, a working farm and
farm-education center run by Three Rivers Parks, with a big red barn and
heirloom chickens and sheep.</p>
<p>Donated by the son of Richard and Isobel Gale in 2000, it teaches city
and suburban kids where food really comes from. On Saturday mornings,
people can meet the animals and help with chores, and youths can sign up
for a Farmers in Training day camp where they collect eggs, milk cows
and feed animals.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From the farm, we rode through downtown Mounds and over a boat crossing
into Spring Park.  There, the classic Minnetonka Drive-In conveniently
abuts the trail, and there's a little speakerphone bicyclists can use
to get their food delivered to the picnic tables.</p>
<p>As we ate root-beer floats, an entire hockey team came down the trail,
complete with sticks, shin-guards and, for some reason, fright wigs.
They gulped free water at the drive-in and were on their way.</p>
<p>Spring Park is little more than an isthmus between arms of the
octopus-like lake, which has 125 miles of shoreline. From there,
bicyclists pass a bit of Orono before coming to Minnetonka Beach,
another isthmus.</p>
<p>Here, the exclusive Lafayette Club occupies perhaps the best piece of
land on the entire lake. It was founded in 1899 on the rise where James
J. Hill built the luxurious Hotel Lafayette in 1882; when the hotel
burned in 1897, Hill sold the prime lakeshore to the club's founders.</p>
<p>The tennis courts are screened from passing bicyclists, and golfers
cross it on a little overhead bridge. Princely houses line both sides of
the peninsula, separated only by a street and our trail.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minnetonka_trail_bridge.jpg" alt="A bridge on the Dakota Rail Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A bridge crosses the busy boat crossing between Crystal Bay and Smiths
Bay.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then the trail crosses the channel between Crystal Bay and Smiths Bay,
over a continual procession of speedboats and pontoons. That puts
bicyclists in Orono again, and a trail sign points to Noerenberg
Gardens, once the estate of the founder of Grain Belt Brewery.</p>
<p>The gardens are another place I've always wanted to visit, so we rode
the .9 mile along North Shore Drive. It's a popular spot for weddings,
and the grounds were filled with a wedding party, having photos taken
among the beautifully landscaped gardens while their guests settled into
the small lakefront pavilion.</p>
<p>Just short of Tanager Lake, we turned around and rode back. When you're
not sightseeing, the miles go by in a flash, and soon we were back on
Lake Waconia.</p>
<p>From there, we continued west through wetlands, meadows and corn fields
to the trailhead in Mayer, where a trail kiosk explains the history of
the town and Hill's Great Northern Railway.</p>
<p>The trail continues for a few blocks more, and the next stretch will
extend it to Hutchinson along Minnesota 7.</p>
<p>Few trails in Minnesota have more attractions than this one. Judging
from the numbers, people are happy to ride it again and again.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: <a href="http://www.threeriversparks.org/index.php/location/dakota-rail-regional-trail">Dakota Rail Trail</a></h3>
<p><em>What to know</em> : If you're coming from the east, it's best to start in
Wayzata and not Waconia or Mayer.</p>
<p>Be very careful at highway crossings. And local police have been known
to ticket bicyclists who don't stop.</p>
<p>For more about other trails west of Minneapolis, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-minneapolis-st-paul/">Bicycling through
the Minneapolis suburbs</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://wayzatachamber.com/visitors/">Wayzata</a></strong> : The downtown has
many shops and restaurants. Caribou Coffee and Ben &amp; Jerry's are among
those popular with bicyclists.</p>
<p>In summer, the village holds free concerts at the depot on Wednesday
evenings. The biggest annual event is James J. Hill Days, the weekend
after Labor Day.</p>
<p><strong>Wayzata Beach and Park</strong> : The trail starts here, on the west end of
downtown and Lake Street. From U.S. 12, take the Ferndale Road exit.
There's parking, and many bicyclists also park across from Shaver Park
on Peavey Lane.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.threeriversparks.org/location/noerenberg-gardens">Noerenberg
Gardens</a>
in Orono</strong> : It's open from 8 a.m. to sunset from May 1 to Oct. 15.
Gardeners often give free tours. It's 3½ miles from Wayzata.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Minnetonka-Drive-In/119634238119">Minnetonka
Drive-In</a>
in Spring Park</strong> : This friendly spot offers free water and is a great
place to stop for soft-serve ice cream or a burger and onion rings.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://bigstoneminigolf.com/">Big Stone Mini Golf &amp; Sculpture Garden</a>
in Minnetrista</strong> : This fun spot is open from 11 a.m. to sunset.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.threeriversparks.org/index.php/location/gale-woods-farm">Gale Woods
Farm</a>
in Minnetrista</strong> : The visitor center and farm store are open Mondays
through Saturdays and Sunday afternoons.</p>
<p>Check for frequent special events, such as Breakfast on the Farm and
Harvest Hoedown. It's 10½ miles from Wayzata.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.stbonibistro.com/">St. Boni Bistro</a> in St. Bonifacius</strong> :
This organic, sustainable-foods restaurant alongside the trail serves
good food and has a patio and a bike rack. It's 13½ miles from
Wayzata.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.destinationwaconia.org/tourism.html">Waconia</a></strong> : The
trail passes the north shore of Lake Waconia, though there's no lake
access.</p>
<p>The downtown is on the south shore of the lake and has nice restaurants,
including the <a href="http://irontapmn.com/">Iron Tap Restaurant &amp; Beer Garden</a>
on Main Street, which serves lots of craft beers.</p>
<p>However, it's not that easy to get there.</p>
<p>On the east shore, County Road 155 is scenic but hilly. It connects to
County Road 30, and bicyclists have to ride a short stretch on busy
Minnesota 5 to get into downtown.</p>
<p>On the west shore, bicyclists have to ride North Shore Road, which is
partially gravel, to County Road 10, which has shoulders of varying
width. However, there's an off-street bicycle trail from its junction
with Waconia Parkway into town.</p>
