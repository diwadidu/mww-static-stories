</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Mankato is easy to overlook, even though it's home to a state
university, gateway to the prairie and prominent in Minnesota history.</p>
<p>Downtown is girdled by highways and train tracks, befitting Mankato's
longtime status as a trade town. Its streets are quiet, except when the
many bars throw a block party.</p>
<p>It's not on the beaten path, either. Motorists headed down the
Minnesota River to <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-ulm-german-heritage/">New
Ulm</a> take the shortcut
from St. Peter, and people headed for
<a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/pipestone-quarries-minnesota/">Pipestone</a> or
the Black Hills use interstates.</p>
<p>The Vikings' training camp brings some tourists to town in late July
and August, and 14,000 students beef up the place when they report for
classes at Minnesota State University.</p>
<p>The Betsy-Tacy children's books, written in the 1940s and '50s, draw a
few fans to sites author Maud Hart Lovelace used in the series. But they
never achieved the fame of books written by Laura Ingalls Wilder, who
lived just down the road in Walnut Grove.</p>
<p>Mankato is most noted for an execution. In 1862, starving Dakota lashed
out at settlers, and after the six-week war ended, 303 of their warriors
were brought to Mankato for hanging.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>President Lincoln reduced the death sentences to 39, and one warrior was
reprieved, but it still was the largest mass execution in U.S. history.</p>
<p>The Dakota were banished from Minnesota, and for more than a century,
they avoided Mankato. But in 1972, the town invited the Dakota to hold a
commemorative powwow.</p>
<h3>Land of memories</h3>
<p>Since 1974, the Mahkato Wacipi has brought people from many states to
Land of Memories Park, and every third-grader in town attends its
Education Day.</p>
<p>The hanging site on Riverfront Drive now is Reconciliation Park, marked
by a buffalo made of local Kasota limestone, also used for the new
Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The Minnesota River is just across the railroad tracks. Flowing in from
the west, it makes an abrupt 90-degree turn in downtown Mankato, where
it hits bedrock and turns north to meet the Mississippi at Fort
Snelling.</p>
<p>The Minnesota made Mankato a transportation and political hub.</p>
<p>But now, it and six other rivers are making it a bicycling hub, because
the town has a handy network of paved trails that connect it to the
countryside and also the 39-mile Sakatah Singing Hills State Trail.</p>

<p>Nearly all the trails are beautiful. After the last Ice Age, meltwater
cut into the soft, flat prairie left by Glacial Lake Agassiz and created
a web of ravines and valleys as it flowed toward the Minnesota.</p>
<p>On their steep sides, the ravines preserve scraps of the Big Woods that
once met the prairie near Mankato.</p>
<p>&quot;Mother Nature has been kind to us here in Mankato by providing us with
some beautiful scenery,&quot; says Alan Forsberg, Blue Earth County
engineer. &quot;I think we have more miles of river than any other county in
the state.&quot;</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Blue Earth County — named for the English translation of
mahkato, the Dakota word for the area's greenish-blue, claylike soil —
helped put a bicycle trail onto an abandoned Milwaukee Road line.</p>
<p>It runs near the Blue Earth River, crosses the Le Sueur and, for much of
its length, follows a ravine.</p>
<p>The Red Jacket Trail takes its name from a flour mill, built in 1866 at
the confluence of the two rivers; it took its name from a Seneca chief.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From Mankato's Minnesota River Trail, it runs 6½ miles to the village of
Rapidan, from which most bicyclists ride another two miles on County
Road 9's paved shoulder, swooping down the Blue Earth River valley to
the Rapidan Dam.</p>
<p>The settlers banished the Dakota but kept their names. To the south,
Good Thunder is named for Andrew Good Thunder, the Dakota chief whose
return to the Minnesota River Valley in 1883 marked the end of the
Dakota exile from Minnesota.</p>
<p>Winnebago is nearby on the Blue Earth River; the Winnebago, now
Ho-Chunk, had a reservation on prime farmland and had little or nothing
to do with the 1862 war, but they were banished along with the Dakota.</p>
<p>Mankato is the name of an important Dakota chief who was killed by a
cannon ball in the closing days of the conflict.</p>
<p>To the west, Sleepy Eye is named for the chief who is said to have
advised Mankato's founders to build their trading post on the bluff, not
on the floodplain.</p>
<p>Just west of Mankato, Minneopa State Park comes from the Dakota word for
&quot;water falling twice.&quot; The South Route Trail takes bicyclists there
from the Red Jacket Trail, and the county and city plan to extend the
Minnesota River Trail to the park, making a loop.</p>
<p>The Minnesota River Trail already connects to the Sakatah Singing Hills
State Trail, also named by the Dakota, which passes 39 miles of southern
lakes on its way to Faribault.</p>

<h3>A ride into the countryside</h3>
<p>One September, I rode the trails around Mankato with my friend Karen, a
long-distance rider.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, she rode her thick-tired mountain bike to slow her down
as we rode the <strong>Red Jacket Trail</strong> south
from Riverfront Drive, past Rasmussen Woods Park and then Mount Kato, a
ski slope that grooms mountain-bike trails in summer.</p>
<p>We crossed the 80-foot-high trestle bridge over the Le Sueur River and
rode through a stand of hardwood trees that had sprinkled the trail with
golden leaves.</p>
<p>When we got to the village of <strong>Rapidan</strong>,
we stopped at the Peddler of Rapidan, a gift shop in an old creamery,
then rode on the paved shoulder of County Road 9 to the Rapidan Dam.</p>
<p>The 1910 dam on the Blue Earth River still generates electricity, and
there's a lovely park, but like most people, we went there to eat at the
<strong>Dam Store</strong>.</p>
<p>The modest cafe opened as a bait shop in 1911, and over the years, it's
become famous for its pies and old-fashioned atmosphere.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The plump pies sitting on a tray, still warm and sprinkled with sugar.
Karen's eyes widened when she had a bite of my riverberry pie.</p>
<p>&quot;My sour cream-raisin is decent, but yours is really good,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>A crowd of gulls was waiting for fish on the sandbars above the dam as
we pedaled out of the steep river valley, already working off our pie.</p>
<p>&quot;I've decided not to hate hills,&quot; Karen said. &quot;I could hate hills, but
around here, what's the point?&quot;</p>
<p>A prairie tail wind pushed us back to the Red Jacket's junction with the
<strong>South Route</strong>, and we rode west toward <strong>Minneopa State Park</strong> past yellowing fields
of soybeans and scarlet sumac.</p>
<p>Like St. Anthony Falls in the Twin Cities, Minneopa's falls migrated
upstream as chunks of shelf rock collapsed under their pressure.
Minneopa Creek's two cascades, surrounded by outcroppings of golden
stone, were a popular tourist destination in the late 19th century, and
in 1905, Minneopa became the third state park, after Itasca and
Interstate.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mankato_river_trail.jpg" alt="A bicyclist in Mankato." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Minnesota River Trail connects the Red Jacket and Sakatah trails.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But when we were there, the falls had slowed to a trickle, revealing a
compact bowl shaded by trees.</p>
<p>&quot;It's beautiful when it's running, but it's kind of nice to have it dry
like this, so we can see what the stone looks like,&quot; Karen said.</p>
<p>At a park kiosk, a map of Minnesota showed northern coniferous forest
and where hardwood forest meets prairie grasslands. It showed no towns,
only zones, two of them meeting at a big river with a distinctive bend,
smack in the middle of southern Minnesota. Karen pointed at it.</p>
<p>&quot;That's what I like about living in this area — I can look at this map
and say, 'I live right there,' &quot; she said. &quot;I've been up to Gooseberry
and Split Rock, and it's beautiful, but that's not all of Minnesota.&quot;</p>
<p>Riding back into town, we passed people jogging, walking dogs and
strolling with children. At Riverfront Drive, we passed Mankato West
High School, where U.S. Rep. Tim Walz was the 2003 Mankato Teacher of
the Year.</p>
<p>Then we rode onto the <strong>Minnesota River Trail</strong>, emerging on a wide-open, treeless vista
of river, riprap, grain terminals and train tracks.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't mind an industrial landscape,&quot; I remarked, taking in the
striking panorama.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't, either,&quot; Karen replied. &quot;But some people want it all
pretty.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/mankato_powwow.jpg" alt="Dancers compete at the powwow in Mankato." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From downtown, we followed the river north past an iron-castings plant
and then along crumbling sandstone cliffs. At U.S. 14, we turned east
and rode past truck yards and warehouses until we reached North
Riverfront Drive.</p>
<p>The 39-mile <strong>Sakatah Singing Hills State Trail</strong>
starts a quarter-mile away, at the edge of
a soybean field whose waving tips looked almost purple in the
late-afternoon light, like a lavender field in Provence.</p>
<p>On the way back, we rode off the trail and into <strong>Old Town</strong>,
where a few antiques and gifts shops
have planted themselves in 19th-century brick storefronts. We ate
calzone and veggie sandwiches at the Coffee Hag, which smelled of
incense and had a tiny stage and a sprinkling of old sofas.</p>
<p>The coffeehouse had just hosted the annual South Central Minnesota
Pridefest, a colorful gathering of many kinds of people.</p>
<p>We finished our ride downtown, where a cluster of seven bars, popular
with university students and other young people, has earned the nickname
&quot;Barmuda Triangle.&quot;</p>
<p>Mankato has many faces, not all of them obvious on a casual drive
through town. From a bicycle, however, its charms are more apparent.</p>
