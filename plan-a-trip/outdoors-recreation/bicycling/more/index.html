<h2>Folk schools, more</h2>
<p>When we were kids, we liked winter. Remember?</p>
<p>We built snow forts and made snow angels. We caught snowflakes on our tongues and took flying leaps on patches of ice.</p>
<p>Now we've grown up, but winter still is fun � maybe more fun.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it's good to be grown up and out of school: no more tests, no more books, no more teacher's dirty looks.</p>
<p>But it's also good to be a grown-up who's back in school, because schools have grown up, too. There are no tests and few books, and teachers are as friendly and attentive as cruise-ship hosts.</p>
<p>In fact, attending some schools is a lot like being on vacation.</p>
<p>Door County was aglow with autumn colors while I spent a week studying photography on the wooded campus of the Clearing, and it was prime ski season while I studied German at Concordia Language Villages in Bemidij.</p>
<p>I was away from home, staying in a beautiful setting, eating well, getting exercise, meeting interesting people � it sure felt like vacation.</p>
<p>I've also studied photography at a learning center high above the North Shore and at a retreat on a lake.</p>
<p>I've learned how to string snowshoes at a beautiful state park, skate-ski at a northern Wisconsin environmental center and improve my tennis game at a college campus in the Minnesota River Valley.</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>You'd think I'd be pretty good at stuff by now. But learning from people who really know what they're doing only drives home the fact I know very little. As Eartha Kitt said, &quot;I'm always learning. My tombstone will be my diploma.&quot;</p>
<p>Next, I want to study glassmaking at the Grand Marais Art Colony and bread baking at the North House Folk School.</p>
<p>Why lie around on vacation when you can acquire a skill?</p>
<h3>Informal education</h3>
<p>Like the North House, the Clearing in Door County was founded on the Scandinavian tradition of folk schools � but 62 years earlier, in 1935.</p>
<p>Like the North House, it's in a beautiful area that draws vacationers. Many of the vacationers eventually put down year-round roots, allowing the Clearing to draw instructors from a deep pool of talent.</p>
<p>&quot;It's bottomless,&quot; says community-programs director Tom Bronsky. &quot;It's such a super-enriched environment up here, you wouldn't believe it.&quot;</p>
<p>Many instructors are renowned in their fields; the instructor of &quot;Atomic Energy and Atomic Bombs,&quot; Bronsky said, had worked on the Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>ADS:16</p>
<p>In winter, classes are held all over Door County, but in summer, they're held in and around lovely stone buildings on the 130-acre wooded campus.</p>
<p>Courses focus on science, history, theater, film and religion as well as the arts, but the hands-on classes fill fastest, says Clearing director Mike Schneider.</p>
<p>They're all noncompetitive; the Clearing's founder, Danish landscape architect Jens Jensen, meant for it to be a place where ordinary people could escape the city to learn and relax in a beautiful, stress-free setting.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing formal about anything here,&quot; Schneider says. &quot;If you want to skip class, you can do that; I encourage it sometimes, on a nice day.&quot;</p>
<p>Winter is the time to sign up for summer courses at schools and centers in the region. At the Clearing, classes in watercolor, quilting and woodcarving fill especially quickly, though many people on waiting lists eventually get in.</p>
<p>For many people, learning or honing skills in beautiful areas � Door County, the North Shore, the north woods, Mineral Point, the bluffs of northeast Iowa � are special treats. And for others, it becomes a lifestyle.</p>
