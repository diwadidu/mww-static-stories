<h2>For a ski weekend, this friendly city belongs on the Eh list.</h2>

<p>Thunder Bay is the Miss Congeniality of Canada-blessed but not
beautiful, endearing yet not alluring.</p>
<p>Craggy bluffs flank this working-class town of 120,000 on one side, and
Lake Superior on the other. But the candy-striped smokestack of a paper
mill is the first thing seen by those who arrive by air or U.S. highway.</p>
<p>Beyond is an unremarkable sprawl of commerce and industry. But Thunder
Bay's homeliness is only skin-deep to those who know where to go: To
the marina, where lovely sunsets frame the Sibley Peninsula with glowing
bands of peach and slate-blue.</p>
<p>To the Hoito in the Finnish district, where crowds wait patiently for
crepe-like pancakes that make regular ones seem like papier-mache. To
Italian cafes, for real gelati. And to Loch Lomond and Mount Baldy,
where slopes are steep but prices gentle.</p>
<p>Thunder Bay never will make the cover of Conde Nast Traveler, but it's
got many charms. One year, a friend and I flew there in early March.</p>
<p>The Saturday-morning flight along the North Shore was worth the price
just for the bird's-eye view-of a Tinker Toy-size Aerial Lift
Bridge in Duluth, the twisting ribbons of the rivers that feed Lake
Superior, the stark canvas of black treetops broken by snow-filled
ravines.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In just an hour and a half, we had traded the dirty slush of the Twin
Cities for the sparkling snow of Thunder Bay.</p>
<p>These days, it costs five times as much to get there by air, so most
people will drive. And the Canadian loonie is close to par with the U.S.
dollar, so a trip no longer is cheap.</p>
<p>Is it still worth going? Absolutely. Thunder Bay is the largest town on
Lake Superior, but it has a small-town atmosphere.</p>
<p>Prices are about what you'd pay in the States, though downhill skiing
still costs a little less. And the dining, much of it in restaurants
that are much more ethnically authentic than anything across the border,
is fantastic.</p>
<p>After arriving, we drove straight to Loch Lomond ski hill, in the
Nor'westers on the southern edge of town. It has 14 runs, the longest
of which is 1½ miles, and   a 750-foot drop.</p>
<p>Despite the beautiful day, and perfect conditions, we never had to wait
for the lifts.</p>
<p>After skiing, we checked into the Prince Arthur, a renovated 1911 hotel
that overlooks the marina and Sleeping Giant Provincial Park on Sibley
Peninsula, whose Ojibwe-named terrain gives Thunder Bay the world's
largest natural freshwater port.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/h/thunder_bay_hoito2.jpg" alt="People wait in line outside Thunder Bay's Hoito restaurant." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
There's always a line outside the Hoito, famous for Finnish pancakes.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Hundreds of people were in town for the annual Sleeping Giant Loppet, a
cross-country tour and race on the long peninsula.</p>
<p>We watched the harbor lighthouse gleam in the waning rays of daylight,
then drove to a brew pub on Red River Road.</p>
<p>While sampling the house lager, we struck up a conversation with the
locals that covered all the topics dear to their hearts-the  value
of Canada's &quot;loonie,&quot; shopping in the States, French separatists,
recent warm winters and the exodus of young people to Calgary.</p>
<p>Then we drove to Bistro One, whose plain façade  gave little clue to the
atmosphere inside.</p>
<p>It was festive, befitting the extremely high quality of the food. We had
an appetizer of wine-steamed mussels with basil and leek cream,
cognac-flamed duck breasts with a black-currant sauce, rosemary-roasted
rack of lamb with Gorgonzola butter, and warm chocolate gateau with
raspberry coulis and cappuccino ice cream.</p>
<p>The next morning, we walked over to the Finnish neighborhood. Three men
were chatting in Finnish outside the Hoito, and the entryway was filled
with people waiting for the famous pancakes.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Founded in 1918 as a co-operative restaurant for young Finnish men in
wilderness bush camps, it still serves huge portions of homestyle food
at low prices.</p>
<p>After brunch, we went skiing again. Mount Baldy, just north of town and
inland, is Thunder Bay's second ski hill, with 10 runs.</p>
<p>On Monday, we returned to the Finnish-Italian neighborhood around Bay
Street, buying jars of pesto at the Maltese Grocery on Pearl Street and
pastries at La Dolce Vita, a charming Italian bakery on Algoma Street.</p>
<p>Thunder Bay may not be known for its luxuries, but perhaps it should be.
If you're looking for a little spree at affordable prices, this
friendly city is the place to go.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Thunder Bay in winter</h3>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : It's 40 miles from the border, or about an hour and a
half from Grand Marais, Minn. Eastern Standard Time starts at the
border, so you'll lose an hour.</p>
<p>Be sure to have a passport or passport card. If you're bringing a child
not your own, you must have notarized permission from parents. For
complete information, check <a href="http://travel.state.gov">travel.state.gov</a>.</p>

views; ask for an upper-floor lake-view room. Standard rooms have
fridges and microwaves.</p>
<p>I've stayed at the Prince Arthur three times and always had a pleasant
experience, but many online reviewers savage the place.</p>
