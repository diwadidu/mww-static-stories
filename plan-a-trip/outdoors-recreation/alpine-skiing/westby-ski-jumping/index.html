<h2>A Norwegian village in southwest Wisconsin has a longtime love affair with ski jumping.</h2>

<p>In Westby, Norwegians take their love of tradition to extreme heights.</p>
<p>The high ridges and deep coulees south of La Crosse drew so many
Norwegian immigrants in the 19th century that the area around Westby
became known as &quot;America's little Gudbrandsdal,&quot; after the valley
in Norway.</p>
<p>The Norwegians had left their homes, but not their customs. Today,
Norwegian flags fly from lampposts, and the visitors center is a
stabbur, a top-heavy wood building used in Norway since the Middle
Ages.</p>
<p>In May, the trolls and folk costumes come out for the annual celebration
of Syttende Mai, the Norwegian constitution day. Norwegian-Americans and
even Norwegians from Norway seek out its imports store.</p>
<p>&quot;They say, 'Oh, you have it all, you have the real Norway here,' &quot;
says Jana Dregne of Dregne's Scandinavian Gifts.</p>
<p>One tradition is a lot harder to maintain, but the folks of Westby have
done it for a century. The town has only 2,000 people, but in
February, it puts on a ski-jumping tournament that draws athletes from
around the nation to its carefully groomed Olympic-size hill.</p>
<p>It's one of only a few in the United States: Park City, Lake Placid,
Steamboat Springs . . . and then there's little Westby.</p>
<p>&quot;The hard-core guys get together and just start working,&quot; said Randy
Mikkelson, manager of the Snowflake Ski Club clubhouse.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In the summer, they make sure the hill's dimensions are just so. In the
winter, they draw water from a well at the top of the hill and cover it
with artificial snow, better than natural snow because it's denser,
cleaner and resists melting.</p>
<p>Then the whole town turns out for the tournament
in February, turning the flat floor of Timber Coulee into a big tailgate
party. People sit in chairs around bonfires, grilling bratwurst. The
mayor gives a speech. The local princesses speak. Children are set loose
on a snow pile spiked with money.</p>
<p>It's a typical small-town festival. And then the jumping starts.</p>
<p>I've never been to a Winter Olympics, but I'm pretty sure you can't
watch from the top of the jump. You can in Westby.</p>
<p>You can walk right up and watch as the young athletes hurl themselves
off a scaffold and down the 118-meter hill, the equivalent of jumping
off a 41-story skyscraper.</p>
<p>It's quite a sight, the parade of neon-suited jumpers flying by at 55
mph, but it's the sound that's so mesmerizing: When a jumper picks
just the right moment to take off, snapping from a crouch into a nearly
horizontal V, the resulting <em>thwump</em> of
air against gut is like the buzz of a giant, very angry bumblebee.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/e/westby_stabbur.jpg" alt="The judging chalet in Westby." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Alongside the ski hill, judges watch from a building designed in the
style of a Norwegian stabbur.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;Whoa, what a wicked sound,&quot; said a man watching near me.</p>
<p>Skiers from Austria, Slovenia, Ukraine, Finland, Sweden, Germany,
Poland, the Czech Republic and Norway have competed.</p>
<p>When Westby was a stop on the Continental Cup circuit, the town paid
half their travel expenses, splitting them with Iron Mountain, Mich.,
just over the Wisconsin border, to which the skiers go next for a tournament on its 133-meter hill.</p>
<p>Skiers stay the week with local families, and by tournament time,
they've got a ready-made cheering section. Andrea Eitland had hosted
the Czech team for six years and called them &quot;our guys.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We get so attached to them, we usually cry when they leave,&quot; she
said.</p>
<p>The view is magnificent from the top, but on cold days many spectators
stay in their cars, honking wildly after good jumps. Judges watch from
the seven windows of the stabbur on the side of the hill, evaluating
style and grace, and markers measure distance.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>After the skiers land and glide out of the chute, the Snowflake
princesses run up to get photos of themselves with the skiers — the
cute ones, anyway.</p>
<p>The year I went, two Olympians were jumping with the U.S. Ski Team. There was triumph, as a Slovenian set a
hill record.</p>
<p>And there was humiliation, when skiers botched their landings and sank
to their knees, cradling their heads in disgust.</p>
<p>But there weren't a lot of people to see it. Fifty years ago, the event
drew 20,000 spectators; now, it's down to 3,000.</p>
<p>&quot;When I grew up, you would not even think of coming in to park a
vehicle, because there were so many people you could hardly find
standing room,&quot; said NanJean Hoff of Windsor, Wis., who came wearing
a vintage raccoon coat that stood out amid the parkas and camouflage
jackets.</p>
<p>&quot;We have world-class skiers coming; why would you not come down and
watch them? I just think it's a treasure.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/e/westby_norwegian_flag.jpg" alt="The Norwegian flag in Westby." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But ski-jumping is an expensive sport, and young Americans have other
things to do. Westby hasn't had a jumper of its own for years.</p>
<p>Westby physician P.T. Bland, who perhaps had done more than anyone to
maintain Westby's place in the ski-jumping firmament, was 84 that year
and watching from a warm truck.</p>
<p>&quot;It'll come around,&quot; he said. &quot;We've got the Norwegian heritage,
we've got the hills, you can't find a better place. This is what we
do. Westby is identified with ski jumping.&quot;</p>
<p>Bland became a world-renowned ski-hill designer by accident, after a
Norwegian visited in 1967 and saw that skiers were flying too high.</p>
<p>&quot;He said, 'Your hill is bad, you have to learn how to fix it,' &quot;
Bland said. &quot;So I went to Norway and talked to this crusty old guy, and
I said, 'Why don't you write a book about designing ski hills?' and
he said, 'Doctor, why don't you write a book about being a doctor?'
&quot;
Bland persisted, learned hill-design mechanics and went on to consult
around the world and chair the U.S. Ski Association jump-design
committee for two decades.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not Norwegian, I've never jumped, but I'm your man for ski
hills,&quot; he said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/e/westby_jumper_princess.jpg" alt="A Westby princess and a ski jumper." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>As the afternoon waned, shadows crept toward the hill and men in
crampons climbed up to place pine boughs around the K point, easier for
skiers to see than the spray-painted red lines that show where the hill
begins to flatten out.</p>
<p>After the last skier had jumped, the unofficial winners were announced,
and a cannon at the bottom of the hill was fired twice. The German coach
caught it all with his camcorder and shook his head, muttering, &quot;This
is crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>Anyone who comes for the tournament should check out the town, too. I'd
go back just for the truly excellent Valentine's sweetheart cookies
from the Westby bakery,; after I tasted them, I went
back for another dozen.</p>
<p>It was the same story at the Westby Cooperative Creamery, founded in
1903: I went in for aged Cheddar and came out with three pounds of
especially good Amish cashew crunch from Hidden Ridge Farm.</p>
<p>You can get a cappuccino at the sunny espresso bar of the Westby
Pharmacy and shop for imported goods at Dregne's. In Poplar Coulee,
west of Timber Coulee, there's snowshoeing on five miles of trails at
Norskedalen Nature and Heritage Center, which has a visitor center,
arboretum and restored Norwegian pioneer homestead to explore.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The coulees are beautiful in winter, when shifting shadows highlight
their sinuous, snow-covered curves. It's easy to see why the Norwegians
loved these tucked-away valleys, so well-suited for their favorite
sport.</p>
<p>&quot;Wherever you live in the world, you've got to take something out of
it,&quot; said P.T. Bland, the honorary Norwegian. &quot;The tournament is a great prescription for the community. Plus,
it's a lot of fun.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Westby, Wisconsin</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em>  La Crosse is three hours from St. Paul; Westby is
another half-hour.</p>
<p>To get to Timber Coulee, take Wisconsin 27 north from Westby, then
County Road P west.</p>
<p><a href="https://snowflakeskiclub.com/large-hill-ski-jumping-tournament"><strong>Snowflake Ski-Jumping
Competition</strong></a>:  It's the first weekend in February. Pork sandwiches, brats and other
food are sold at the hill.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations:</em>  The <a href="http://www.westbyhouse.com">Westby House B&amp;B</a>,
just off main street, is an 1890s Victorian and adjacent guest house
with seven rooms and suites.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.norskedalen.org/">Norskedalen</a> rents
its 1870s <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/18267979">Per and Anna Paulsen
Cabin</a> for two-night weekends for

<p>Twenty minutes west of Westby on U.S. 14/61, near La Crosse,
the <a href="http://www.wilsonschoolhouseinn.com">Wilson Schoolhouse Inn</a> is a
beautifully restored 1917 schoolhouse with a lavishly equipped kitchen,
two bedrooms and two bathrooms. It has a queen, two twins and two

<p><em>Ski jumping</em> <em>elsewhere:</em>  Many of the Westby skiers go on to compete
in Iron Mountain, Mich., just over the Wisconsin border. The Continental
Cup tournament at the 133-meter <a href="http://www.kiwanisskiclub.com/">Pine Mountain
jump</a> also is a great
spectator event.</p>
