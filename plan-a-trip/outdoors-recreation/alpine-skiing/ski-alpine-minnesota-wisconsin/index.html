<p>Whenever I get out of the forest and onto the hills, I remember
something: Downhill skiing is a blast.</p>
<p>One year, when snow was thin on the cross-country trails, I went to
Lutsen Mountains on Minnesota's North Shore. Its longest run is two
miles, and flying down its long, undulating hills, only to be carried
back up in a chairlift, made slogging through the forest seemed like
chump work.</p>
<p>At a Jayhawks concert at Papa Charlie's, the restaurant/nightclub at
the foot of the hill, a fellow skier from the Twin Cities gave me a
succinct explanation for why he likes skiing there.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just so much more fun to go down, down, down and down before you
go up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>If you like to feel the wind in your face, here's where to ski and
snowboard.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Alpine skiing isn't cheap, so always check websites for deals; they're
best midweek and early and late in the season. Buy tickets online
and in advance to save more.</p>
<p>Buy tickets, sign online waivers and reserve lessons and children's
programs in advance. All ski hills offer lessons, and some have special
package deals for beginners. They don't publicize them much, so ask or
look closely at websites.</p>
<p>For some of the best deals, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/ski-snowboard-beginner-deals/">Bargains for
beginners</a>.</p>
<p>For more about ski lessons, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/lutsen-ski-lessons/">Class on the
slopes</a>.</p>
<p>Late winter and spring is a good time to learn, when snow is softer and
more forgiving. Skiing can be good through April Fool's Day at the
resorts on Michigan's Upper Peninsula, which also offers the best
late-season deals.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_ski_school.jpg" alt="Ski school at Lutsen." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3>Minnesota</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.lutsen.com/">Lutsen</a> Mountains on Minnesota's North Shore.</strong>
This popular hill has the region's
steepest vertical drop, the longest runs and the widest variety. It also
has lovely views of Lake Superior, but skiers sometimes have pay for
them by tolerating ice and wind generated by the lake.</p>
<p>There's a restaurant, live concerts on weekends and lodgings right on
the hill-Eagle Ridge is closest, followed by Caribou Highlands
Resort and, a short way down the hill, the modest Mountain Inn.</p>
<p>The ski hill also lists a huge array of lodging packages; if you know
area accommodations well, you can find some good deals.</p>

<p>Its own Lodge at Giants Ridge is a good value for ski-in, ski-out
lodgings. There's not a lot to do at night, though.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/alpine-skiing-giants-ridge/">Downhill on the Iron

<p><strong><a href="http://www.spiritmt.com/">Spirit Mountain</a> in Duluth.</strong>
This resort in the hills above Duluth
has the best view, the best midweek deals and the best variety of
accommodations, restaurants and nightlife. Its vertical drop is
second-highest, after Lutsen, and it has many nice intermediate runs.</p>
<p>If you stay at one of the local hotels midweek, you can get deals, such as two free
half-day lift tickets, as well as everything else Duluth offers.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.trollhaugen.com/">Trollhaugen</a> near Taylors Falls.</strong>
This friendly hill actually is on the
Wisconsin side of the St. Croix River but offers a lot of events and
deals aimed at skiers from the Twin Cities, just half an hour to the
west.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.buckhill.com">Buck Hill</a> in Burnsville.</strong>
This hill alongside Interstate 35, just
south of Minneapolis, is where Olympian Lindsey Vonn first honed her
techniques.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.aftonalps.com/">Afton Alps</a> in Afton.</strong> This hill along
the St. Croix River southeast of St. Paul has 50 trails and 18
chairlifts.</p>

Association</a>: For $199, you get a
Skiing Wisconsin Passport good for one lift ticket apiece at 17 ski mountains, including
Trollhaugen near the Twin Cities, Cascade Mountain near the Dells and

This ski hill on Wausau's Rib Mountain
has 74 runs on a 700-foot hill served by seven chairlifts, one
high-speed. It offers live music on Saturdays and many family
activities.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>

area and has popular snowshoeing trails.</p>

This resort and convention center in the
Baraboo Hills, just east of Devil's Lake State Park, has a 500-foot

<p>It's a favorite of intermediate skiers and Chicagoans. There's also a
3½-mile cross-country loop on the golf course.</p>
<p>There's a large lodge and inn on site, with a pool and hot tub center,
and condos nearby. It has a ski school and good midweek deals for groups

or in Portage.</p>

<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/spring-skiing-up-whitecap/">Cruising at Whitecap</a>.</p>
<h3>Michigan's Upper Peninsula</h3>
<p>For natural snow and lots of it, the resorts around Ironwood
(including Whitecap, just across the border in Wisconsin) are the
obvious choice.</p>
<p>People in the Twin Cities, the closest metropolitan area, seem to think
these resorts are on the other side of the moon, but it takes about 4½
hours to drive there, the same as Lutsen (from Duluth, take U.S. 2
across Wisconsin).</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/r/ironwood_powerhorn_skiers.jpg" alt="Skiers on the hill at Big Powderhorn." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
From Big Powderhorn, skiers can see the Copper Peak ski flying hill in
the distance.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This is where you can count on snow. If they like, skiers also can
cross-country ski or snowshoe to nearby waterfalls. Accommodations are
inexpensive, deals are easy to find and the locals are friendly.
There's a dearth of fine dining, though.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/alpine-ski-ironwood/">Ski the UP</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/nordic-skiing-ironwood/">Ironwood the
reliable</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.bigpowderhorn.net/">Big Powderhorn Resort</a> near Ironwood.</strong> This resort is cheerful and open, with 33 trails equally divided for
beginners, intermediates and experts. It has two terrain parks, and it
adjoins the Wolverine Nordic-skiing system.</p>
<p>There are many places to stay, in condos and chalets.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.snowriver.com/">Snowriver Mountain Resort's Jackson Creek Summit</a> near
Wakefield.</strong> The former Indianhead resort, one of three along U.S. 2, has a 638-foot
drop, 30 runs and two terrain parks. It has many nice intermediate runs,
but 46 percent are rated expert. Lift tickets also are good at
Snowriver's Black River Basin.</p>
<p>It has a sunny chalet atop the mountain that always has a fire
crackling. There's an older hotel, where rooms are a good value for
budget skiers, plus more luxurious condos.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.snowriver.com/">Snowriver Mountain Resort's Black River Basin</a> near Bessemer.</strong> This is
a snowboarder favorite. The former Blackjack resort has a 465-foot drop and 20 trails, including
two glade runs. It has three terrain parks, one for beginners, and kids
12 and under ski free. Lift tickets also are good at Snowriver's Jackson Creek Summit.</p>
