<p>For alpine skiers, these are the best days of the year.</p>
<p>At least, they are at Lutsen Mountains on Minnesota's North Shore.</p>
<p>Started in 1948, the ski hill has the region's steepest vertical drop,
the longest runs and the widest variety, plus a killer view of Lake
Superior.</p>
<p>Over the years, it's also become a party destination, with
Saturday-night concerts by well-known bands and something every night of
the week — acoustic music, comedy, open mics, dance parties.</p>
<p>The season starts with the holidays and goes full-bore until carnival
time in March, when skiers schuss around in grass skirts and watch
fireworks. In April, skiers sit at outdoor beer gardens, listening to
live bands.</p>
<p>Still, most people go for the skiing and that view of the big lake.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The first time I rode up Moose Mountain in its little red gondola car,
whorls of vapor were curling from the lake's surface. At the mountain
top, the afternoon sun was painting a peach backdrop behind whitened
trees, their snow-crusted branches as knobby as moose antlers.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at how beautiful that is, the frost on the top of the trees,&quot;
said a ski instructor. &quot;Words can't do justice to it.&quot;</p>
<p>Usually, I ski cross-country, but at Lutsen, I remembered something:
Downhill skiing is a blast.</p>
<p>Especially on Moose Mountain, where the longest run is two miles.
Suddenly, slogging through the forest seemed like chump work compared
with flying down those long undulating hills, only to be carried back up
in a chairlift to do it again.</p>
<p>I stuck to the many intermediate trials, except when I missed the
turnoff to Moose Return and plummeted down the expert Moose Drop.</p>
<p>I finally found Moose Return and skied down the mountain to the Bridge
chairlift, which I took to the top of Eagle Mountain.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_ski_lodgings.jpg" alt="Lodgings on Lutsen Mountains." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Eagle Ridge Resort is right on the mountain.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then, I skied Bridge Run right down to my room at Eagle Ridge Resort,
where I threw on a swimsuit under my ski suit and followed boardwalks to
the outdoor pool, enveloped by inviting billows of steam.</p>
<p>It was warm, although not warm enough to thaw my toes. But there was
plenty of room in the hot tub inside, and that did the trick.</p>
<p>Next door at the ticket office, a line had formed for tickets to that
night's concert at Papa Charlie's. Over a nice plate of Norwegian
salmon in the restaurant, I listened to the sound check.</p>
<p>It was still early, so I drove down to Lutsen Resort on the lakeshore,
where Swedish immigrant C.A.A. Nelson homesteaded land in 1885 and soon
found himself lodging visitors.</p>
<p>His grandson George Jr. started the ski hill after serving in the famous
10th Mountain Division during World War II, and in 1976, his
great-grandaughter Cindy won a bronze medal at the Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Today, its 1953 lodge no longer is associated with the ski hill, but
it's still one of the coziest places in the state. I fetched a glass of
ale from he bar and sank into one of its polished-leather chairs to
watch the fire and listened to a hypnotic acoustic guitar set.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Back at Papa Charlie's, more than 700 music fans were making the joint
jump. I waited for the concert with a member of the Twin Cities River
Rats, a precision water-ski team, who gave me a succinct explanation for
why they ski at Lutsen but snub smaller hills closer to the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>&quot;It's so much more fun to go down, down, down and down before you go
up,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>That's Lutsen's ace in the hole, and the reason it has flourished in
the last decades as smaller hills have closed. Its owners have
steadily upgraded it to make Lutsen a Midwestern rival of Western ski
destinations.</p>
<p>Today, the nightlife and speed runs attract young people. The gentle
trails of Ullr and Mystery mountains attract families.</p>
<p>The 825-foot vertical drop and variety — 95 runs on four mountains —
attract serious skiers who can't afford more than one or two annual
trips out West. The most luxurious of the accommodations attract those
who can.</p>
<p>Lutsen also has a snowshoe trail and groomed cross-country trails. They
might attract skiers, but I suspect, not for long. In Minnesota, the
lure of a real mountain is tough to resist.</p>
