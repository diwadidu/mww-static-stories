<p>Ah, the smell of Coppertone in spring.</p>
<p>Leaning back on a chairlift, basking in sun bounced off acres of snow, I
was getting quite a tan — on St. Patrick's Day.</p>
<p>Michigan's Upper Peninsula, with its towering stacks of snow, is a good
place for skiers to be in the spring.</p>
<p>The annual snowfall average is more than 200 inches, courtesy of winds out of the
Canadian Rockies, which, when they hit land after whipping across Lake
Superior, dump enough to make the western U.P. one of the snowiest spots
in the nation.</p>
<p>When a friend and I were there in mid-March, snowbanks were rust-tinged
and curling at the edges, but they still reached up to the windowsills
on ramblers and over my head along roads. We were after the snow, of
course, but also skiing variety and bargains.</p>
<p>Just inside Wisconsin's border with Michigan, Whitecap Mountains is no
glamour puss.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But this is the Gogebic Range, a rough-and-tumble former mining area
whose charm lies in authenticity, not polish.</p>
<p>Hurley, 12 miles east, was known as the nation's roughest town in the
1880s, and Silver Street still has a faintly menacing air, especially
where it dips past a small gantlet of &quot;gentlemen's clubs&quot; before
transforming into the cheerful main street of Ironwood.</p>
<p>And Whitecap, as a ski area, has lots of charm. Rising from deep forest,
its three hills feel more like mountain than nearby ski areas, and Ski
magazine has ranked it No. 1 in the Midwest for terrain.</p>
<p>Forty-three runs, four of them double black-diamond, plummet down
Thunderhead, Eagle's Nest and Whitecap mountains, which rise in each
others' shadows. And lines for the lifts? Barely there.</p>
<p>The long, woodsy cruises down Thunderhead were our favorites,
particularly Hintertux, a lovely, intimate lane that winds around the
mountainside, allowing skiers to take in the view of fjord-like Weber
Lake before depositing them at the bottom of Whitecap Mountain.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/r/ironwood_powerhorn_skiers.jpg" alt="Skiers on the hill at Big Powderhorn." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>I'd never seen anything like it, nor anything like Thunderhead's ski-in
Wine Hut. Standing by a wood-burning stove, we gazed out the open door
and sipped hot cider spiked with cinnamon schnapps and white wine made
in Iron River.</p>
<p>The atmosphere, combined with Whitecap's isolation, made us feel as if
we'd walked through a time warp. Our room, however, was in a brand-new
building, with two king beds, a phone, and a TV. There was no maid
service and no staff on the premises, but we didn't really care.</p>
<p>The best lodgings at Whitecap are the newer ones; the older ones have
quaint Tyrolean-village exteriors, but interiors with one foot in the
'60s.</p>
<p>The 1960s not only were the heyday of Midwestern ski resorts but the end
of an era in Hurley. The Montreal Mine, the largest underground mine in
the nation, closed in 1962, and Cary Mine in 1965.</p>
<p>At the Iron Nugget, where we had dinner, glass cases hold miner's gear
and ore samples, and there's a nifty &quot;Historic Tabletop&quot; made of wooden
nickels, old drink chips and dice.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century, little Hurley had 101 saloons, five gambling
dens and 14 brothels. Prohibition was a wild era, and Ralph and Al Capone once hung out in the town's saloons.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Ironwood's downtown, just a few yards away, is pure small-town
Americana, with furniture stores, a renovated 1928 vaudeville house and
a pub where we celebrated St. Patrick's Day with green beer and live
music.</p>
<p>I was pretty pleased with myself for finding such a good place to ski
over St. Patrick's Day, but then a co-worker trumped me by taking her
family of five up for April Fool's Day weekend.</p>
<p>&quot;There were times when only our family was skiing,&quot; she said. &quot;It was
really nuts, but it was really great.&quot;</p>
<p>Nordic skiers already have discovered the area's remarkable snow,
flocking to Ironwood's ABR trails when little snow falls elsewhere. One of
these days, Whitecap and its neighbors on the U.P. also will get the
skiers they deserve.</p>
<p>Until then, consider yourself in on the secret.</p>
