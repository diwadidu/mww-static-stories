<h2>At snow-blessed Michigan resorts, skiers and boarders get the drift.</h2>

<p>The snow appeared on cue, just as Wisconsin faded into the Upper
Peninsula. One minute there was a dusting, and the next a whole layer,
white and inviting.</p>
<p>It seemed too perfect, as if there must be snowguns hidden behind the
&quot;Welcome to Michigan&quot; sign. But there was snow beyond that, too,
right up to the doors of the ski resorts that line U.S. 2 just
inside the state line.</p>
<p>That's why they call this Big Snow Country. Winds from the west whip
across Lake Superior, picking up warmth and moisture, and dump it as
snow — more than 17 feet annually, on average — when they hit the
cold inland air of the U.P.</p>
<p>Consider it the Midwest's snow reservoir. We did, when we made
reservations for the week before Christmas, which is iffy elsewhere in
the Upper Midwest. And the U.P. came through, not only with the snow,
but with great skiing, too.</p>
<p>The first ski hill, Big Powderhorn Mountain, is just five miles inside
Michigan; it has 25 runs in a nice variety that attracts families.</p>
<p>Snowriver Mountain's Black River Basin, formerly Blackjack, has 24 runs, including mogul fields that attract experts and a
100-foot-long, 10-foot-high half-pipe chute that attracts snowboarders.
It's known as the locals' favorite.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Snowriver Mountain's Jackson Creek Summit, formerly Indianhead, has 30 runs and lots of good runs for intermediates. Its main
lodge and chalet are on top of the mountain, and clusters of condos sit
next to the chair lifts; it's a destination resort that draws skiers
from around the region.</p>
<p>They all sit within five miles of each other on either side of the
village of Bessemer, along the Gogebic Range, and all face Lake
Superior, 17 miles to the north.</p>
<p>Iron ore was found here in 1880, and Bessemer, Ironwood and neighboring
Hurley became rough-and-tumble mining towns until the 1960s, when their
deep-shaft mines no longer could stand competition from the open-pit
taconite mines of Minnesota's Iron Range.</p>
<p>Today, the old-fashioned downtowns of Ironwood and Hurley look stuck in
the '60s; they're a fascinating side trip off U.S. 2.</p>
<p>But there's not much of a glamour factor, despite the nearby ski
resorts. So don't expect apres-ski bars and French bistros.</p>
<p>&quot;This isn't a ski town, it's a mining town,&quot; said Gary Alkire, an
Indianhead ski instructor. &quot;It's a lot like the Iron Range up here;
they're East Rangers.&quot;</p>
<p>But the friendliness factor makes up for the lack of glamour.</p>

<p>&quot;One of the first things I noticed when I moved here is people are so
nice and friendly,&quot; said Norway-born instructor Bjorn &quot;Bing&quot;
Bang. &quot;I thought, 'These Finlanders are so nice' — of course,
they're not all Finlanders.&quot;</p>
<p>At the former Indianhead, we got to know Alkire, Bang and the other instructors as
well as Leonard, an elderly man in a Santa hat who roams the chalet
putting logs on the fire and busing trays in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Friendly young people adjusted our bindings, sold us a gaiter and stored
our skis overnight.</p>
<p>The prices were friendly, too. Peak-season skiing and lodging cost
quite a bit more, but specials and packages cut costs.</p>
<p>In three days, we packed in a lot of skiing. After the first run on the
first day, my son Peter was shouting, &quot;I love skiing; it's my favorite
sport!&quot;</p>
<p>We schussed right from the slopes onto the chairlifts, progressing from
green to blue runs, and on the second day Peter and his sister,
Madeleine, were ready for the five-hour Cruiser camp.</p>
<p>After they'd finished that, they took the plunges with aplomb, Peter
still with the bat-out-of-hell technique but Madeleine with tidy little
turns.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The temperature hadn't risen above zero, so they'd earned some play
time in the lodge pool. In the hot tub, I discussed local snow
conditions with Mary Loven of Northfield, Minn., who, like me, had been
checking U.P. websites before she drove up.</p>
<p>The inland resorts had gotten 41 inches of snow, but Porcupine Mountains
Wilderness State Park, right along the lake, had barely received any.</p>
<p>But just before she and her husband, Tom Holt, and two sons drove up for
a cross-country skiing vacation, the snow fell.</p>
<p>&quot;We really got lucky, but we didn't realize how lucky until last
week,&quot; she said. &quot;It was so beautiful. The snow was this thick on
the branches.&quot;</p>
<p>Cross-country skiers and snowmobilers also flock to the U.P., especially
when their home conditions are bad.</p>
<p>In Michigan, the U.P. is so remote it's considered the state's own
Alaska — 600 miles from Detroit, contributing only 4 percent of the
state's population and no longer good for mineral wealth.</p>
<p>The U.P., however, has one last resource — snow and more snow. And to
winter-loving residents in neighboring states, that's a rich resource
indeed.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Alpine skiing in the Upper Peninsula</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> It's a 4½-hour drive from the Twin Cities, the
closest metropolitan area. For the most reliable road conditions, take
I-35 to Duluth and U.S. 2 across Wisconsin.</p>
<p><em>Downhill skiing:</em> <a href="https://www.snowriver.com/">Snowriver Mountain's</a> Jackson Creek Summit and nearby <a href="http://www.bigpowderhorn.net">Big
Powderhorn</a> have vertical drops of 638 and
622 feet, a little less than Spirit Mountain in Duluth. Snowriver Mountain's Black River Basin has a drop of 465 feet.</p>
<p>For the best deals, go midweek, before Christmas and after March 1.
Always ask for specials and packages. Children 9 and under ski free per
paid adult.</p>
<p>On the northeast edge of Ironwood, <a href="https://www.gogebic.edu/Welcome/StudentLife/mtzion.html">Mount Zion Recreational
Complex</a>, part
of Gogebic Community College, has a 300-foot drop and inexpensive lift
tickets.</p>
<p>It also has a <em>snow tubing hill</em> with three chutes and a lift.</p>
<p><a href="https://whitecapresort.com/"><strong>Whitecap</strong></a>: The woodsy ski resort just
across the Wisconsin border from Ironwood has the prettiest terrain of
the group. See <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/spring-skiing-up-whitecap/">Cruising at Whitecap</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dining:</em> In downtown Hurley, just across the Montreal River from
downtown Ironwood, the <a href="https://www.ironnugget.com/">Iron
Nugget</a> on Silver Street is
friendly, has a nice atmosphere and a menu that includes gnocchi,
spinach ravioli and other Italian specialties.</p>
<p><em>Nightlife:</em> The 1928 <a href="https://www.ironwoodtheatre.net/">Historic Ironwood
Theatre</a> downtown is a renovated
vaudeville house that showcases visiting performers.</p>
