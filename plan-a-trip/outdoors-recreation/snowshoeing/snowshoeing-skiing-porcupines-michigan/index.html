<h2>In the Upper Peninsula, a wilderness park rewards those who love snow.</h2>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the far end of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Porcupine Mountains
Wilderness State Park always rewards those who make the effort to get
there.</p>
<p>When 12 of us did, steering through a blizzard in cars heaped with
snowshoes and skis, our prize was even more snow-falling every day
from the sky, swirling in stiff winds and piled high on the earth.</p>
<p>Luckily, we retain a child-like love of the white stuff. So we had
ourselves a snowpalooza, gliding through snow-draped forests, making
snow angels and taking countless photos of snow mushrooms, snow arches
and snow slabs on Lake Superior.</p>
<p>And the snowshoeing? The best of our lives.</p>
<p>A hundred miles of trails crisscross the 94 square miles of the park,
whose ridges rise 1,000 feet above 23 miles of Lake Superior shoreline.</p>
<p>Only the eastern corner of the park is open in winter, because it's a
pain to keep roads plowed. Park employees got stuck three times just
plowing the short drive to Kaug Wudjoo Lodge, the former park manager's
residence where we stayed.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We envied the snowmobilers who were whizzing along the groomed Lake of
the Clouds Trail to the magnificent overlook that's the main tourist
draw in summer. In winter, it's accessible only by sled or a very long
hike.</p>
<p>Other than that, we were happy to explore on foot.</p>
<p>On the first afternoon, we snowshoed from our door to the little marina
on Union Bay and along Lake Superior, where winds had pushed ice and
snow against the shore and arranged slabs that, in one spot, formed a
perfect whale.</p>
<p>For blazing trail through the woods, we strapped on big Greenland and
Ojibwe snowshoes that gave us the loft we needed for the thigh-deep
snow.</p>
<p>We were awestruck by the lavish quantities of powder and the beauty it
created just by falling. One favorite photo op: square dollops of snow
that sit atop stumps and look like giant mushrooms.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On Saturday, we joined a free snowshoe hike. The park also has a
downhill area run by ski-industry students at Gogebic Community College
in Ironwood, so we snowshoed over there on the Nonesuch Trail to meet
park naturalist Bob Wild.</p>
<p>In the snowshoe hut near the chalet, he gave those of us with
traditional snowshoes more modern ones with metal crampons, for traction
descending the ski hill.</p>
<p>Then we got on the chairlift and rose into the air, craning our necks to
see  the panoramic view of Lake Superior behind us.</p>
<p>From the top, it was all down, down down. We bounded along the Hidden
Valley alpine run and then into deep forest, to a warming house on the
Log Camp cross-country trail, where we passed other guests on their way
to the rustic Union River Cabin.</p>
<p>A spur took us to East Vista, where we gazed out at the lake and along
the shore as it starts to form the Keweenaw Peninsula.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At least three of us asked Wild about the big &quot;lake&quot; just beyond the
park's eastern boundary. He said it actually is a sea of tailings from
the White Pine mine, which extracted nearly 2 million metric tons of
copper from 1955 to 1995 and has just been purchased for continued
mining.</p>
<p>There were mines in the park, too, and the Cuyahoga run and Nonesuch
trail are named for them.</p>
<p>While the copper left, the trees stayed. Loggers were eager to get to
the area, known as the &quot;Great Uncut,&quot; but in 1945 it was made a
state park, preserving a stand of old-growth forest that is is
considered the biggest and best of its kind east of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>Bears are plentiful in the park, and Wild told us of one that
cross-country skiers had found hibernating nearby-right in the
middle of a trail.</p>
<p>When the bear got sleepy at the beginning of winter, Wild said, it
simply dug a hole and flopped down. Machine groomers had been driving
over it all winter, but no one spotted it until the skiers came by in
late winter and saw it underfoot. Male bears, Wild added, aren't very
picky about where they sleep.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porcupines_narnia.jpg" alt="Snowy trail in the Porcupines." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Caribou were native to the area, but deer moved in only after mining
created open spaces. They spend the winter under a canopy of hemlocks
near the lake, off the Deer Yard ski trail, trying to avoid the park's
wolves.</p>
<p>We headed to that area Saturday evening for the weekly lantern-lit ski
on the 1.6-kilometer Superior Loop, just west of the two Union Bay yurts
and our lodge.</p>
<p>From the road, we spotted the first of a string of kerosene lanterns and
followed them through the woods to a roaring bonfire tended by Wild, who
told us to help ourselves to hot chocolate in the warming hut.</p>
<p>On Sunday, we had a choice: More snowshoeing, downhill skiing or
cross-country skiing on trails newly tracked after a groomer was fixed?
A friend advocated for downhill skiing: &quot;How often do you get to ski on
powder like this in the Midwest?&quot;</p>
<p>But the wind was blowing again, so I joined one of two snowshoe groups
heading for the waterfalls at the junction of the Union and Little Union
rivers.</p>
<p>Half of us went over the hill via chairlift, following the first part of
Bob Wild's route, and the rest of us took the River Trail on the east
edge of the park.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porcupines_snow_mushroom.jpg" alt="A snow mushroom in the Porcupines." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When we reached the ravine where the Union River meets the Little Union
River, we were awestruck anew: snow-coated branches formed a canopy over
the trail, creating what a friend dubbed &quot;Narnia.&quot;</p>
<p>It was the way you want winter to be: quiet, serene and drop-dead
gorgeous. We passed three young men, dragging their stuff back to their
car from the Little Union River yurt, and we were glad we didn't have
to leave yet.</p>
<p>A lone skier from Land O' Lakes, Wis., came by and told us he had
rented the yurt for the next weekend with a Kentucky friend and was
checking out the route.</p>
<p>On the way back, we saw he had left us a message in the snow:
&quot;Grouse!&quot; with an arrow pointing to a hole where the bird had
emerged from its snow roost.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other snowshoe group had used a compass to make a beeline
to the Union River, where, like us, they hadn't found any waterfalls
but had exulted in the Narnia-like wonderland.</p>
<p>They didn't straggle in until nearly 6 p.m., and I marveled that we all
had spent so much time in the cold and wind instead of our comfortable
1950 lodge.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/o/porcupines_lodge.jpg" alt="Kaug Wudjoo Lodge in the Porkies." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Kaug Wudjoo Lodge is on Union Bay and sleeps 12 in comfort.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Bearing the area's original name — Kaug Wudjoo, Ojibwe for &quot;place of
the crouching porcupine&quot; — the two-story log lodge has four
bedrooms, two bathrooms, a fieldstone fireplace and as much wood as you
feel like burning.</p>
<p>A picture window provides a view of Lake Superior that is a bit
monochromatic in winter but still worth staring at from one of the
rocking chairs.</p>
<p>We hung our wet hats and mittens on a 10-point buck in the living room
and crowded around a trestle table to eat our meals, prepared in the
fully equipped kitchen.</p>
<p>Still, a lodge is a lodge. There's only one Porkies, and we wanted to
spend as much time in it as we could.</p>
<p>It does take a while to get to the park, and you do have to bring
everything you need, because the nearest town is 13 miles way.</p>
<p>But once you're there, you don't want to leave.</p>
