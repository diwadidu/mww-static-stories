<h2>On Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a series of cascades tumble down to Lake Superior.</h2>

<p>On the western tip of Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the Black River is
only one of more than 200 rivers that feed Lake Superior.</p>
<p>It punches far above its weight, however, in providing waterfalls: Five
of them in one short stretch draw visitors year-round.</p>
<p>Part of the million-acre Ottawa National Forest, the Black River is so
scenic it's part of two national trails — the North Country Trail for
hiking and the Black River National Forest Scenic Byway for driving.</p>
<p>The waterfalls were the draw for me and some friends one March. Coursing
over slabs of volcanic rock, they punctuate the last three miles of the
river before it flows into Lake Superior.</p>
<p>In winter, people can get close and even clamber right into the river
gorge to see them.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>My friends and I stayed across from Great Conglomerate Falls at Bear
Track Cabins, in an old logging-camp bunkhouse and a 1938 chinked-timber
former tavern that once catered to loggers and fishermen.</p>
<p>Now it's a roomy lodge, with a wood stove, a piano and decor that
includes snowshoes, a stag head, a vintage radio and twinkle lights
wrapped around thick ceiling beams.</p>
<p>Once, the scenic byway that passes its front door was a wagon road,
connecting Lake Superior to the iron mines on the Gogebic Range. A
fishing village formed around the river's mouth, and 200 people once
lived around Black River Harbor.</p>
<p>Today, it's a recreation area operated by the U.S. Forest Service and
frequented by boaters and campers. The most spectacular waterfall is the
last, Rainbow Falls, less than a mile away.</p>
<p>From the road, we climbed down a long flight of wooden steps and stood
staring at its furious waters, pounding over a 40-foot ledge and into a
frothing pool.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/bessemer_black_river_boardwalk.jpg" alt="Hiking along the Black River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Temperatures had risen, and mist drifted along the cliff face, shaping
draped snow into femurs and shin bones. On the rocks, plumes of spray
had created a patch of cauliflower snow.</p>
<p>Aside from the froth, dyed by hemlock bark, the whole world was a grimy
white. Then a few rays of sun broke through the clouds, and we saw the
shimmer of a rainbow in the mist.</p>
<p>From the falls, we hiked through hemlock forest, following the blue
diamonds of the North Country National Scenic Trail toward Lake
Superior.</p>
<p>A suspension bridge crossed the river, and we climbed to an overlook,
where we could see the setting sun reflected in pools of golden water.</p>
<p>People were poking around the little harbor, wandering from the marina
dock out to the big beach on Lake Superior.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From there, it's just five miles over wind-packed snow to four
picturesque waterfalls around the mouth of the Presque Isle River, in
Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park.</p>
<p>It's a fast ski in colder temperatures. But when we were there, the
snow was too soft to allow the trip.</p>
<p>The next day, we strapped on snowshoes and headed into the forest across
the road. Gorge Falls squeezes through a narrows lined with cedar, and
water was spurting over the 20-foot drop like the ball in a pinball
machine, hitting first one side, then the other.</p>
<p>Blue-tinted icicles had sprouted on the cliffside, and the foam at the
bottom of the falls was frosted with tannins and heaving like a
waterbed. The roar of water filled the narrow gorge.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/l/black_river_lodge.jpg" alt="Lodge of Bear Track Cabins on the Black River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The lodge of Bear Track Cabins once was a tavern that catered to
loggers.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then the roar stopped. We waited, but all we heard was a muffled whoosh.
The water no longer was crashing; ice had given way and allowed it to
flow straight into a channel under the frozen surface.</p>
<p>In winter, ice shifts as quickly as a mirage. From Gorge Falls, we hiked
upstream to Potawatomi, which is almost as tall as Rainbow. It had split
into two torrents, one shooting under a snow bridge and one dropping
straight into a hole, from which vapor floated up like a bridal veil
hanging on breeze.</p>
<p>At Great Conglomerate Falls, the river had split, bumping down three
steps and around a dimpled patch of snow. Under our feet, the snow had
turned slushy; it seemed as if the whole forest was leaking water.</p>
<p>Most of the group decided to head to deeper snow inland, at Big
Powderhorn ski hill and the ABR cross-country trails.</p>
<p>We decided to spend a little more time on the North Country Trail, near
the back side of <a href="https://copperpeak.net/">Copper Peak</a>, the only
ski-flying hill outside of Europe.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Algonquin Falls is more like a rapids, but we walked there anyway.</p>
<p>The trail is popular with deer, too, and we frightened one away as we
made our way through the hemlock and cedar.</p>
<p>Once at the river bank, we stood watching thick shingles of
honey-colored ice butting their way down river, like tectonic plates
bobbed up from the depths.</p>
<p>There's not much to see along the Black River except water and rock.
But the view changes every minute.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Waterfalls of the Black River on the Upper Peninsula</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> It's a 4½-hour drive from the Twin Cities, 5 hours
from Madison and nearly 6 hours from Milwaukee.</p>

In winter, the mouth of the Black River on Lake Superior is a moonscape
of rock and ice.

in April and May, and the last two weeks of May are peak for spotting
spring ephemerals in the woods.</p>
<p>In the heat of summer, the Black River Recreation Area is very popular,
especially the sand swimming beach. In fall, the forest colors are among
the best in the region.</p>

snowshoes.</p>
<p>In the woods behind the resort, there are 7.5 miles of trails that are
groomed but not tracked. Call 906-932-2144.</p>
