<h2>National forests, state parks and wildlife preserves roll out the white carpet for winter hikers.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/a/hayward_birkie_snowshoe.jpg" alt="Hayward's Birkie Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Birkebeiner trail near Hayward is a snowshoeing superhighway.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the week before Christmas, I figured I'd found the prettiest place in
the world.</p>
<p>Fresh snow had fallen around Hayward, and the forest was sparkling. We
made our way down the intimate lanes of the Makwa Trail on snowshoes,
brushing past heavily laden balsam boughs as we scaled gentle ridges and
descended into snowy glades.</p>
<p>Each new tableau was more beautiful than the last, and I congratulated
myself on the discovery that single-track mountain-biking trails are
great for snowshoeing.</p>
<p>Then one of those boughs snapped into my face, and I wrenched my neck
whipping it away. We had to cut the hike short so I could get some
heavy-duty muscle relaxants from the local clinic, but I'll always
remember it.</p>
<p>On snowshoes, I've had the most fun bushwhacking on new snow. The first
time, it was in Nicolet National Forest, and a friend and I set off from
Bear Paw Outdoor Adventure Resort wearing rounded bear paw snowshoes.</p>
<p>That part of Wisconsin is too remote to have many trails, so we made our
own as we wove through old-growth pines to the Wolf River, gurgling
under a sheath of ice. It was the only sound and we were the only
people; we thought we were in heaven.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Most people want trails, but the best are the ones you make yourselves,
and they can be anywhere.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't encourage people to use trails because we want them to
strike off on their own,&quot; says Brenda Rederer, manager of Chippewa
Moraine Ice Age State Recreation Area, which supplies snowshoes to
visitors. &quot;Why snowshoe on trails then; why not just walk it?&quot;</p>
<p>It's all good when there's snow. Many chapters of the Ice Age Trail
Alliance sponsor snowshoe hikes; check its
<a href="http://www.iceagetrail.org/calendar">calendar</a> for dates.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best places to go in Wisconsin .</p>
<p>For lighted hikes, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/candlelight-ski-snowshoe-events/">Ski or snowshoe by
candlelight</a>.</p>
<p>Before going, check the Wisconsin <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/snow_report.aspx">snow-conditions
report</a>.</p>

<h3>Northwest</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.cambatrails.org/">CAMBA trails</a> between Hayward and Cable.</strong>
This network of mountain-biking trails
includes more than 300 miles of marked and mapped routes in six clusters
around the towns of Hayward, Seeley, Cable, Drummond, Delta and
Namakagon.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/e/bearpaw_snowshoers.jpg" alt="Snowshoers walk through the snowy forest near Bear Paw Outdo" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Guests at Bear Paw Outdoor Adventure Resort snowshoe through Nicolet
National Forest.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For intimate lanes and rolling hills, seek out the more difficult single
track. The Makwa Trail is close to Hayward and very scenic. To reach the
trailhead, drive six miles east of Hayward on Wisconsin 77 to Mosquito
Brook Road and head north.</p>
<p>Pick up maps and rent snowshoes at <a href="http://www.newmoonski.com/">New
Moon</a>, on U.S. 63 just north of Hayward.
Reserve in advance for weekends, 800-754-8685.</p>
<p>There's plenty of room to snowshoe on the broad Birkebeiner ski trail,
which the CAMBA trails cut across, but it's not as fun.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://northendskiclub.org/trails/">North End Snowshoe Trails</a> near
Cable.</strong> Stop at the fine <a href="http://www.cablemuseum.org/">Cable History
Museum</a>, then drive two miles on Randysek
Road to these three marked loops in the woods.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/chipmoraine/">Chippewa Moraine State Recreation
Area</a> near New Auburn.</strong>
This rolling glacial moraine north of
Bloomer, part of the Ice Age National Scientific Reserve, has 23 miles
of marked trails, including three loop trails around kettle lakes
outside the Interpretive Center, which has more than 50 pairs of
snowshoes to lend out.</p>
<p>To reserve snowshoes for them, call 715-967-2800.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://landmarkwi.org/brownstone-trail-updates/">Brownstone Trail</a>,
Bayfield.</strong> The Bayfield Regional Conservancy maintains this five-mile
trail, which starts across from Maggie's at Manypenny Avenue and Third
Street.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Another good place to snowshoe in town is on the Big Ravine
Trail, at the
end of North Third Street behind the outfield fence of the baseball
field, and the Iron Bridge Trail, on the other side of the ravine at
Washington Avenue and Broad Street.</p>

<p><strong>Mawikwe Bay ice caves near Cornucopia.</strong>
If there's fresh snow, you have to use snowshoes to get to these
magnificent, ice-draped cliffs on the Lake Superior shoreline.</p>
<p>Before you go, call the National Park Service at 715-779-3397, Ext. 3,
to see if the lake is frozen enough to allow access. If it's not, you
can snowshoe toward them on the clifftop <a href="https://www.nps.gov/apis/planyourvisit/hiking.htm">Lakeshore
Trail</a>, reached from
the Meyers Beach parking lot off Wisconsin 13, five miles east of
Cornucopia.</p>

snowshoeing. From Wisconsin 13 south of Bayfield, take County Road J 2Â¼
miles to the trailhead.</p>

explore on snowshoe.</p>
