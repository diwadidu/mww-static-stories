The Gunflint Trail in northeast Minnesota always has ample snow.

<p>Everyone likes to snowshoe. It's cheap, easy and you can do it
anywhere.</p>
<p>In winter, snowshoes are the bridge into the wild white yonder. They
allow you get off the beaten path and to places that otherwise would be
hard to explore-islands, overgrown woods, bogs and marshes.</p>
<p>In deep snow, the first person to break trail has to expend some serious
effort. If you're the fourth or fifth person on the trail, though,
that's just about right.</p>
<p>If you're the 20th, you can just wear hiking boots. Often, I've wound
up ditching my snowshoes when I'm in a state park, because the trail to
wherever I'm going is so packed I don't need them.</p>
<p>Yet trails give you a cleared path through brush and are laid to take in
the best scenery, so it's hard to ignore them.</p>
<p>Any state park or nature center is good for snowshoeing; look for wooded
areas that are protected from the sun and wind. Sheltered sections of
bicycle trails work, too.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>If you'd like to get away from the crowds, try a state forest, wildlife
area or natural area. On mountain-biking trails, single track provides
interesting terrain for snowshoeing.</p>
<p>Anywhere you can hike, you can snowshoe. For more ideas, see our
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/">Hiking</a> section.</p>
<p>Be careful on lakes; they freeze at night and thaw during the day,
creating a crust that snowshoers might break through to slush.</p>
<p>Before you go, check a state's Department of Natural Resources website
for snow conditions in
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snow_depth/index.html">Minnesota</a> and
<a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/snowreport/snowmobile">Wisconsin</a>. The
Upper Peninsula of Michigan almost always has excellent snow.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best places to snowshoe in the Upper Midwest. For a
list of lighted treks, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/candlelight-ski-snowshoe-events/">Ski or snowshoe by
candlelight</a>.</p>
<h3>Michigan</h3>
<p>The sparsely populated Upper Peninsula is almost solidly national and
state forest, providing unlimited snowshoe opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Porkies</strong> : On the western edge of the
peninsula, along Lake Superior, <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/porcupines-wilderness-park/">Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State
Park</a>
has 100 miles of trails and lots of snow.</p>
<p>It rents four year-round yurts, two on Lake Superior's Union Bay and
two that require guests to hike in by snowshoe or skis.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-skiing-porcupines-michigan/">White gold in the
Porkies</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mtbohemia.com/"><strong>Mount Bohemia</strong></a> : This ski resort on the
Keweenaw Peninsula also has more than 20km of snowshoe trails, free and
open to the public.</p>
<p>Here are 12 other places to snowshoe in the nearby <a href="https://www.keweenaw.info/12-best-keweenaw-snowshoeing-destinations/">Keweenaw
Peninsula</a>.</p>

In northwest Wisconsin, the Birkebeiner ski trail and CAMBA
mountain-biking trails are perfect for snowshoeing.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong>Black River</strong> : Just to the west, five
waterfalls line the last few miles of the Black River as it flows into
Lake Superior, and snowshoeing is the perfect way to tour them.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/black-river-michigan/">Waterfalls of the Black
River</a>.</p>
<p>This area north of Bessemer is part of <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/ottawa">Ottawa National
Forest</a>, and marked sections of the
North Country National Scenic Trail provide even more possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Sylvania Wilderness</strong> : On the southwest
edge of the peninsula, near Watersmeet and just across the border from
Land O' Lakes, Wis., <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/ottawa/recreation/wilderness/index.html">Sylvania
Wilderness</a>
and Sylvania Recreation Area have more than 18,000 acres of old-growth
forest with 34 named lakes.</p>
<p>Once owned by the elite Sylvania Club, which hired armed guards to keep
intruders out, it's now part of Ottawa National Forest.</p>
<p>Pick up trail maps at <a href="http://www.sylvaniaoutfitters.com/">Sylvania
Outfitters</a> on U.S. 2, which rents
snowshoes and also grooms 10 ski/snowshoe loops that connect to
wilderness trails.</p>
<p>The wilderness is less than half an hour from Afterglow Resort in
Wisconsin, which makes a nice base. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/afterglow-ski-resort-wisconsin/">Snow
asylum</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/michigan-pictured-rocks-national-lakeshore/">Pictured Rocks National
Lakeshore</a></strong>
: East of Marquette, the 43-mile Lakeshore Trail along the cliffs of
Lake Superior, in Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, makes scenic
snowshoeing. Much of it is remote, though. The closest trail to Munising
is the 1.2-mile Miners Falls Trail.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nps.gov/slbe">Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore</a> :
Rangers lead <a href="https://www.nps.gov/slbe/planyourvisit/ski.htm">snowshoe
hikes</a> from the visitors
center in Empire every Saturday at 1 p.m. from January through February
and beyond, if conditions permit.</p>
<p>Reserve at 231-326-4700, Ext. 5010. The hike and use of snowshoes is
free.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.visitludingtonstatepark.com/stories/guided_snowshoe_walks_at_the_ludington_state_park">Ludington State

: This popular park on the shore of Lake Michigan offers free 1½-hour
guided snowshoe walks through woods and dunes at 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. on
Saturdays in January and February.</p>
<p>Snowshoes are available on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://northcountrytrail.org/trail/">North Country National Scenic
Trail</a></strong> : This trail has many
other developed sections on the Upper Peninsula and also the Lower

<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/best-snowshoe-trails-minnesota/">Minnesota</a></h3>
<p>In many parts of north-woods Minnesota, especially the Boundary Waters
Canoe Area Wilderness, snowshoes give you the luxury of going anywhere
you want.</p>
<p>The Ely area and the Gunflint Trail, which border the BWCAW, make good
jumping-off points and have good trails of their own through thick
forest.</p>
<p>The Superior Hiking Trail follows the scenic North Shore of Lake
Superior from the Canadian border to Duluth. It's popular, so many
segments quickly become packed. But when there's fresh snow, hiking up
rivers and along gorges is unsurpassed.</p>
<p>In bluff country, trails follow streams through coulees. Even the Twin
Cities have miles of dedicated snowshoe trails.</p>
<p>The state parks offer many naturalist-led snowshoe events, and 31 parks
rent snowshoes for $6 per day.</p>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/best-snowshoe-trails-minnesota/">Snowshoeing in
Minnesota</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-north-shore/">North Shore by
snowshoe</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/best-snowshoe-trails-wisconsin/">Wisconsin</a></h3>
<p>With the 1,000-mile Ice Age National Scenic Trail winding across the
state, there's lots of great terrain-and glacial moraine-on
which to snowshoe.</p>
<p>Wisconsin also has two huge national forests, Chequamegon in the
northwest and north-central part of the state, and the remote Nicolet in
the northeast. Sections of the <a href="https://northcountrytrail.org/the-trail/wisconsin/">North Country
Trail</a> provide good
snowshoeing, especially around Cable.</p>
<p>Along Lake Superior, thousands look forward to making the mile-long trek
over the frozen lake to the mainland ice caves on the Bayfield
Peninsula.</p>
<p>On the Mississippi River in the southwest part of the state, snowshoes
take bird-watchers onto frozen sloughs to see bald eagles.</p>
<p>And this is the state that pioneered snowshoeing and skiing by
candlelight, one of the most magical experiences.</p>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/best-snowshoe-trails-wisconsin/">Snowshoeing in
Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<h3>Illinois</h3>
<p>Near the northern Illinois town of Wonder Lake, McHenry County parks
offer snowshoe rentals at Lost Valley Visitor Center in <a href="https://www.mccdistrict.org/visit___explore/places_to_go/find_a_site/glacial_park.php">Glacial
Park</a>, $10 per day.</p>
<p>In the west Chicago suburb of Lisle, the <a href="https://mortonarb.org/">Morton
Arboretum</a> has 1,700 acres open for snowshoeing.
It rents snowshoes.</p>
<p>Admission to <a href="https://www2.illinois.gov/dnr/Parks/Pages/default.aspx">Illinois state
parks</a> is free,
so take your pick. In winter, one of the most popular is <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/starved-rock-park-illinois/">Starved Rock
State
Park</a>, which features a string of canyons along the Illinois River.</p>
<h3>Iowa</h3>
<p>At <a href="https://www.mvr.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/Lake-Red-Rock/">Lake Red
Rock</a>, just east of Des Moines near Pella, adult and youth snowshoes can be
checked out for a day or weekend, free of charge. Call 641-828-7522 or
641-628-8690 to reserve.</p>
<p>Rangers also guide several Winters Wonders snowshoe hikes each winter,
looking for wildlife.</p>
<p>Admission to <a href="http://www.iowadnr.gov/Destinations/StateParksRecAreas/IowasStateParks.aspx">Iowa state
parks</a>
is free.</p>
<h3>What to wear snowshoeing</h3>
<p>In deep, powdery snow, Ojibwe or Alaskan snowshoes, which have long
tails, are best because they give wearers the most loft.</p>
<p>Rounded bear paws are best for maneuvering in the woods. Metal shoes
with crampons are best for packed, icy snow and for scaling hills.</p>
<p>Don't forget to carry poles if you'll be climbing or descending hills.
Choosing the right bindings also is important; those that are hard to
put on and keep on will take the fun out of the sport.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/buying-making-snowshoes/">Choosing snowshoes</a>.</p>
<p>Mukluks or pac boots, such as Baffins or Sorels, work best with
snowshoes. And to keep snow out of your boots, buy a pair of gaiters to
wear on your shins. They're available at sport shops and from catalogs.</p>
<p>Don't wear too much, since you'll be generating body heat. For more,
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/warm-winter-clothes/">Staying warm in winter</a>.</p>
