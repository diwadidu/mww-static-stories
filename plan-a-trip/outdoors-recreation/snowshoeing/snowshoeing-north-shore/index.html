<h2>In winter, hikers find serenity and stark beauty on trails above Lake Superior.</h2>

Road, on the Superior Hiking Trail near Schroeder.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In summer and fall, hikers by the thousands take to the hiking trails on
Minnesota's North Shore.</p>
<p>In winter? Not so many. But those who strap on snowshoes to climb river
gorges and follow the blue blazes of the Superior Hiking Trail are
rewarded by stark beauty.</p>
<p>The brittle winter sun throws everything into high relief: Black
lenticel pores seem to pop out on trunks of birch that are a brilliant
white against the blue sky.</p>
<p>Sounds sharpen: the snapping and popping of trees in the cold, the
crunch of snow underfoot, the grating croak of a raven. A coating of
snow records the life-and often, death-of small animals.</p>
<p>One January, I snowshoed up to Carlton Peak on a 10-below day with
70-below wind chills. It was so cold the forest's trees were popping
their skins, expanding as the moisture within them froze; the snapping
sounded like the first raindrops before a thunderstorm.</p>
<p>But the wind never found its way to me through the trees, and I was warm
in mukluks, snowsuit and fleece balaclava.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In less than an hour, I was winding my way around the darkened heel of
the peak, a moonscape of ice and frozen lichen on a wall of granite, and
up to the sunny summit.</p>
<p>Lake Superior, about 50 degrees warmer than the air, was steaming away
924 feet below; in the distance, I could see miles of hazy shoreline and
a plume of vapor from the ore-processing plant in Taconite Harbor.</p>
<p>From the summit, the cold seemed rather exhilarating, and the rest of
the three-mile hike was a cakewalk.</p>
<p>The next day was a little warmer, and I walked the five-mile Split Rock
River loop. Newly fallen snow had frosted the fingerlike branches of
baby firs and made the birches a paler shade of white.</p>
<p>Plump little cedar waxwings flitted around like Cinderella's helpers as
I followed the packed trail, high above the open yellow mouth of the
Split Rock River.</p>
<p>There was plenty to look at: a small, frozen waterfall into a creek,
looking just like stalactites in a cave. Piles of chewed-up pinecones
left by a squirrel. Deer tracks into the woods. Coyote scat, bristling
with the hair of some small, unfortunate mammal.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/o/gooseberry_candlelight.jpg" alt="The candlelight ski at Gooseberry Falls State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Paul Sundberg</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The candlelight snowshoe/ski in Gooseberry Falls State Park is very
popular.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Soon, I noticed rows of snowshoe tracks on the surface of the river and
descended the banks. I could hear gurgling under the ice, but it was
good and thick, and I walked upriver until the red-rock walls of the
gorge trailed away into riverbank.</p>
<p>The trail returns on the east side of the river, but I followed the
riverbed back, climbing back to the western spur along a beaver trail
lined with toppled aspen.</p>
<p>On the highway, sharp little flurries had replaced what, only a few
steps inland, had been softly falling snow. I remembered something city
people tend to forget: In the embrace of the forest, winter is much
gentler.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not news to people who live on the North Shore. Ann
Russ, a Tofte teacher and naturalist, loves winter for the serenity it
gives to the forest and for what it reveals to those who venture there.</p>
<p>She shows it all to her students, from the tracks of animals invisible
in other seasons to a birch tree's luminous peach underskin, unnoticed
amid summer's greenery.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;I really get a charge out of taking people out, and oohing and aahing
about what we see,&quot; she says. &quot;The interesting thing about taking a
walk in the woods is that we always see something, but we never know
what it's going to be.&quot;</p>
<p>On a snowshoe hike in George Washington Memorial Pines, a small preserve
just up the Gunflint Trail from Grand Marais, I could see the dramas of
northwoods life sketched in the snow.</p>
<p>Rabbit tracks were everywhere, threading in and out of flocked heaps of
downed boughs and, occasionally, meeting sets of larger tracks with a
longer stride.</p>
<p>Just east of Grand Marais, I hiked atop the sheer, 100-foot walls of the
Devil Track River gorge.</p>
<p>It was a good thing I had poles to help me grip the slippery inclines,
because I was giving all my attention to the scenery-red-rock
cliffs, frozen waterfalls, cascades of icicles.</p>
<p>Scenery is one thing the North Shore has in spades. For hikers, snow
literally is the icing on the cake. Go and enjoy-just don't forget
those long johns.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: North Shore by snowshoe</h3>
<p><em>Events</em> : The naturalist at <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/gooseberry_falls/index.html">Gooseberry Falls State
Park</a>
leads many snowshoe hikes, and there's a candlelight skiing and
snowshoeing event Presidents' Day weekend.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/split_rock_lighthouse/index.html">Split Rock Lighthouse State
Park</a>
also offers hikes, some by candlelight.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://superiorhiking.org/news-events/guided-hikes/">Superior Hiking Trail
Association</a>
offers monthly hikes, guided by a naturalist. The group shuttles itself
back to the starting point.</p>
<p><em>Snow conditions</em> : Check the <a href="https://superiorhiking.org/trail-conditions/">Conditions
page</a> of the Superior
Hiking Trail web site for the latest news. Sometimes, the trailhead
parking lots aren't plowed.</p>
<p><em>Snowshoe rental</em> : At most resorts, use of snowshoes is free for
guests. Gooseberry Falls State Park lends snowshoes for use during
events; call in advance to reserve them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cascadelodgemn.com/">Cascade Lodge</a> between Lutsen and Grand
Marais rents them, and so does <a href="http://www.sawtoothoutfitters.com">Sawtooth
Outfitters</a> in Tofte.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/split_rock_lighthouse/index.html">Split Rock
Lighthouse</a>
and
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/tettegouche/index.html">Tettegouche</a>
state parks rent snowshoes for $6 per day.</p>
<p>For guests at many hotels and resorts, use is free (see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/cabins-resorts/">Where to stay
on Minnesota's North
Shore</a> ). Be sure to take
poles for climbs and icy spots.</p>
<p><em>Good snowshoe hikes</em> : Any place with snow is a good spot. Sometimes,
trails in state parks are so packed you don't evenÂ  need snowshoes.</p>
<p>If there's not fresh snow, choose a spot off the beaten path, away from
the state parks. The <strong><a href="http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/superior/recreation/wintersports/recarea/?recid=64783&amp;actid=90">George Washington Memorial
Pines</a></strong>
preserve, six miles up the Gunflint Trail from Grand Marais, is a good
choice.</p>
<p>A universal favorite is the <strong>Split Rock River Loop</strong> of the Superior
Hiking Trail. The trail starts four miles north of Gooseberry Falls
State Park, at the mouth of the Split Rock River; there's a parking
area.</p>
<p>Not far from the trailhead on the west side of the river, there's a
20-foot blue-ice waterfall on a creek, around the corner from the first
bridge. It's five miles up the west side of the red-rock gorge and back
along a ridge on the east side and down through forest and wetlands.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/caribou_snowshoeing2.jpg" alt="Snowshoeing on the Caribou River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Snowshoers go up the Caribou River on a Superior Hiking Trail
Association guided hike.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's three miles round-trip to <strong>Carlton Peak</strong> from the Britton Peak
parking lot, which is three miles up the Sawbill Trail (County Road 2)
from Tofte.</p>
<p>From the same trailhead, you can snowshoe on the two-mile <strong>Oberg
Mountain loop</strong> , popular in every season.</p>
<p>If you bring skis, you can return to Tofte on a wonderful 3-kilometer
stretch of the <a href="http://www.sugarbushtrail.org/">Sugarbush Trail</a> system
known as the Tofte Ski-Down (see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/ski-north-shore/">Skiing the North
Shore</a> ).</p>
<p>Five miles west of Schroeder, there's a one-mile interpretive trail
through the <a href="http://www.sugarloafnorthshore.org/">Sugarloaf Cove</a>
preserve.</p>
<p>The trails that hug both sides of <strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/cascade_river/index.html">Cascade River State
Park</a></strong>
are scenic in every season.</p>
<p>To the Devil's Kettle in <strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/judge_cr_magney/index.html">Judge C.R. Magney State
Park</a></strong>
, it's 2Â½ miles round-trip along the Brule River.</p>
<p>You can snowshoe along the <a href="http://www.ggta.org/">Gitchi-Gami State
Trail</a>, which has an 17Â½-mile stretch from
<em>Gooseberry Falls State Park to Silver Bay</em> , but much of it is open to
the highway. Try the three-mile stretch through <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/temperance_river/index.html">Temperance River State
Park</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.visitcookcounty.com/the-best-snowshoe-trails-in-cook-county-mn">Visit Cook
County</a>
recommends additional trails.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baptism_snowshoeing.jpg" alt="Snowshoeing on the Baptism River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Snowshoeing up rivers</em> : You can snowshoe on a river itself, but be
careful. Ask a local naturalist for advice, bring a buddy and carry a
stick that you can tuck under your arms horizontally if you fall in.</p>
<p>Thick snow is no guarantee of safety; it's an insulator and may be
keeping water from freezing.</p>
<p>Near Schroeder, there's a 1Â½-mile hike along the <strong>Caribou River</strong> past
Caribou Falls to a bridge and back.</p>
<p>Three miles west of Lutsen, you can snowshoe through the slot canyons on
the <em>Onion River</em> from the Ray Berglund Memorial Wayside parking area.</p>
<p>A 2.4-mile stretch of the Superior Hiking Trail follows the rim of the
<strong>Devil Track River canyon</strong> , with views of the red cliffs and
waterfalls below.</p>
<p>To get there, drive five miles north of Grand Marais to County Road 58
and turn; there's a parking area on the left.</p>
<p>It's 1Â½ miles round-trip up the narrow gorge of the <strong>Kadunce River</strong>
from a wayside 10 miles north of Grand Marais.</p>
