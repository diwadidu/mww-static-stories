<h2>In the land of lakes, it's easy and fun to get off the beaten path.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_headwaters_snowshoeing.jpg" alt="Snowshoeing at Itasca headwaters." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Lauren Gagner</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Itasca State Park, snowshoers can visit the headwaters of the
Mississippi River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There are many good reasons to go off trail, and the chance to see moose
definitely is one of them.</p>
<p>When we were at Bear Head Lake near Ely one January, we hiked first
along a lakeside ski trail that was so packed we didn't need
snowshoes.</p>
<p>But then the ranger mentioned she'd seen moose tracks in fresh snow
near the park entrance, and we decided to go moose-tracking. Strapping
on our snowshoes, we plunged from the road into deep woods.</p>
<p>It was a whole different world. The snow that barely covered our toes on
the edge of the ski trail came up to our knees under the tree cover.</p>
<p>The moose had been everywhere, leaving dainty oval scat. Sometimes
they'd made the tell-tale posthole tracks with their spindly legs, but
more often they'd created cavernous holes as they wallowed through the
snow.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We wallowed, too, but at least we were staying more or less on top of
the snow as we followed the dips and rises of the glade. It was
beautiful, with fresh snow outlining spruce tops and making waffle
patterns on the boughs.</p>
<p>We didn't see any moose, but we felt a little like voyeurs as we
stomped through their tucked-away hangout.</p>
<p>It was one of the best times I'd had on snowshoes, because I'd used
them to go somewhere that otherwise would be off-limits. And by the time
the two of us had shuffled through twice, we'd left a pretty decent
path.</p>
<p>On a trail, your path is decided for you. Off trail, who knows where
you'll end up — or what you'll see?</p>
<p>Minnesota has plenty of everything, marked and groomed snowshoe trails
as well as remote wilderness.</p>

It's easy to snowshoe over lakes, including giant Lake Mille Lacs.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>More than 30 <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/snowshoeing.html">Minnesota state
parks</a> rent
snowshoes for $6 a day. Many parks also offer guided snowshoe hikes,
during which snowshoe use is free (register in advance).</p>
<p>And many state parks offer <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/events.html">guided hikes and snowshoe-making
workshops</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with popular state parks is that trails there often are
quickly packed down. Minnesota's <a href="http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/eco/sna/SNAstatemap.pdf">state natural
areas</a> —
protected spots that are lovely, but without services — often are a
better bet. They're small, but then, you can't travel all that far on
snowshoes, anyway.</p>
<p>Here are some of the best places to snowshoe in Minnesota. For
conditions, check the weekly <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snow_depth/index.html">DNR snow-depth
report</a>.</p>

<h3>North-central lakes</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/itasca/index.html">Itasca State
Park</a> north
of Park Rapids</strong> : There's no bad place to
snowshoe in this beautiful park, but the 3.2-kilometer Dr. Roberts
Nature Trail, 3.1-kilometer Mary Lake Trail near Douglas Lodge and
1.8-kilometer Schoolcraft Trail near the headwaters are groomed for
snowshoeing.</p>
<p>Within the park, <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/snas/sna00958/index.html">Itasca Wilderness Sanctuary state natural
area</a> includes the
Bohall Wilderness Trail.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/itasca-skiing/">Itasca in winter</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.deep-portage.org/">Deep Portage Learning Center</a> near
Hackensack</strong> . At this large reserve an hour
north of Brainerd, the public is welcome to snowshoe on nearly 10 square
miles of forest set on rolling glacial moraine, with seven lakes. There
are snowshoe as well as ski trails; pick up a map in the lodge.</p>
<p>For naturalist-led snowshoe hikes, the snowshoes are supplied.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.brainerd.com/winter/xcskiing/upgaard.html">Uppgaard Wildlife Management
Area</a> near
Crosslake** . Just off the <a href="http://www.paulbunyanscenicbyway.org">Paul Bunyan
Scenic Byway</a>, this 110-acre
non-game wildlife is very quiet in winter and a good place to look for
wildlife. It's nine miles east of Minnesota 371 and Jenkins on County
Road 16.</p>
<p>There are other good spots along the 54-mile byway, which winds around
the Whitefish Chain. The Veterans Walking Trail also is along County
Road 16, 2½ miles east of Jenkins.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.northlandarb.org/recreation">Northland Arboretum</a> in
Brainerd</strong> . This 540-acre preserve, also a trailhead on the Paul Bunyan
State Trail, has many 100-foot red pines and is frequented by fox,
beaver, deer, timber wolves and bears.</p>
<p>It also has nearly 20 kilometers of ski trails, some lighted nightly.
Trails are open from sunrise to sunset, and the visitors center is open
Monday through Friday. A parking donation of $5 is requested.</p>
<p>From Thanksgiving evening until the Saturday after New Year's, the
arboretum also features the Sertoma Club's <a href="http://www.sertomawinterwonderland.com">Winter

<p><strong><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/superior/recreation/recarea?recid=64834&amp;actid=91">North Arm
trails</a>
of Burntside Lake</strong> . These hilly trails are popular for skiing and
hiking, too. From the trailhead, several loops wind through magnificent
old-growth forest and up rocky ridges for spectacular views of
surrounding lakes and forests.</p>
<p>They're reached by turning onto North Arm Road or County Road 644 from
the Echo Trail north of town.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ely.org/things-to-do/winter/snowshoeing/"><strong>North Hegman Lake
pictographs</strong></a>.
It's three kilometers across South Hegman Lake to these ancient red
figures.</p>
<p>Drawn on rock 500 or 1,000 years ago, they depict a moose, an otterlike
animal, a figure that may be human or superhuman and perhaps some
constellations — no one knows for sure. Park off the Echo Trail or
County Road 116, 15 miles north of town.</p>
<p>Outward Bound hosts a free guided snowshoe hike to the pictographs
during Ely's <a href="http://elywinterfestival.com/">Winter Festival</a> in early
February.</p>
<p>If the sun is strong, the lake can get slushy, so wear waterproof boots.</p>

<h3>Duluth</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.hartleynature.org/">Hartley Nature Center</a>. There are more
than 10 miles of hiking trails in this rolling, wooded preserve,
bisected by the Superior Hiking Trail.</p>
<p>It has 70 pairs of <a href="https://hartleynature.org/hartley-park/equipment-rental/">rental
snowshoes</a>,
traditional wooden ones for adults and youths and metal shoes with teeth
for preschoolers through first-graders. Cost is $10 for non-members.</p>
<p>The center is just north of the University of Minnesota-Duluth campus,
off Woodland Avenue/Skyline Parkway.</p>

<p><a href="https://superiorhiking.org/trail-section/mnwi-border-to-duluth/"><strong>Superior Hiking
Trail</strong></a>. Now, 50 miles of the Superior Hiking Trail stretch from the Wisconsin
border to the northeast end of Duluth. In Duluth, it follows roughly the
same ridges and glacial beach terraces used by Skyline Parkway.</p>
<p>Many of the sections may be packed down, but the scenery can't be beat.
One of the best places to snowshoe (if you don't mind hills) is
Magney-Snively Park, on Skyline Parkway just west of Spirit Mountain.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/superior-hiking-trail-duluth/">Hiking in
Duluth</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-north-shore/">North Shore</a></h3>
<p>There are dozens of good places to snowshoe along Lake Superior.</p>
<p>The last three miles of the Duluth-Two Harbors section of the Superior
Hiking Trail mostly follows <strong>Silver Creek</strong> , lined by low cliffs. To
get to the trailhead, take County Road 3 from Betty's Pies, just east
of Two Harbors, and turn onto County Road 301.</p>
<p>Four miles north of Gooseberry Falls State Park, at the mouth of the
Split Rock River, there's a parking area that's the start of the
five-mile <em>Split Rock River</em> loop of the Superior Hiking Trail.</p>
<p>Not far from the trailhead on the west side of the river, there's a
20-foot blue-ice waterfall on a creek, around the corner from the first
bridge.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/caribou_snowshoe_bridge.jpg" alt="Snowshoeing on the Superior Hiking Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the North Shore, it's a four-mile out-and-back hike from the Caribou
River Wayside to the covered bridge over Crystal Creek.

<p>Five miles west of Schroeder, there's a one-mile interpretive trail
through the lovely <a href="http://www.sugarloafnorthshore.org/">Sugarloaf Cove</a>
preserve. Two miles farther west, there's a 1½-mile hike along the
<em>Caribou River</em> past Caribou Falls to the covered bridge over Crystal
Creek and back.</p>
<p>Naturalists at Gooseberry, Tettegouche and Split Rock Lighthouse state
parks lead frequent snowshoe hikes. For times, check the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/events.html">state-park

<h3>Gunflint Trail</h3>
<p>You can snowshoe nearly anywhere, but resorts on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/gunflint-trail-winter/">Gunflint
Trail</a> offer
snowshoeing on 25 miles of marked and groomed trails.</p>
<p>You can also snowshoe into the <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/visit/destination/boundary-waters-canoe-area-wilderness">Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness</a>
; be sure to fill in a free day-use permit. You can plunge in anywhere,
but if you're looking for a trail, you can reach the Boundary Waters
via the <a href="http://www.banadad.org/">Banadad Trail</a> ; Ted and Barbara Young
of <a href="https://www.poplarcreekbnb.com/">Poplar Creek Guesthouse</a> will

just past the Flour Lake Campground.</p>
<p>From here, this trail climbs wooden steps to an iron-streaked cliff high
above the labyrinthine waters of Hungry Jack Lake and, beyond, West
Bearskin Lake. It's especially lovely at sunset.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/superior/recreation/recarea/?recid=40353&amp;actid=50"><strong>Caribou Rock
Trail</strong></a>. Another four miles farther, turn onto County Road 65/Hungry Jack Road
and go to the trailhead. The trail leads to overlooks of West Bearskin
Lake and Moss Lake.</p>
<h3>Twin Cities area</h3>
<p>The problem with snowshoeing in the Twin Cities is that so much of it
already is packed by the time you get there. So try to head out while
the snow is fresh.</p>
<p>The University of Minnesota's <a href="http://recwell.umn.edu/programs/outdoor-adventures">Center for Outdoor
Adventure</a>, in the
basement of the University Rec &amp; Wellness Center at 123 Harvard St. SE,
rents snowshoes. Rentals must be picked up and returned Monday-Friday
between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. or Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. To reserve,
call 612-625-8790.</p>
