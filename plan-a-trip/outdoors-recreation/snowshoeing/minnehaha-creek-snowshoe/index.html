<h2>In winter, walk through south Minneapolis on a famous creek.</h2>

<p>If you're a paddler, you're done for the winter. But when one door
closes, another opens.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to paddle Minnehaha Creek through the heart of
Minneapolis for years, but the water won't stand still-sometimes
it's too high, sometimes too low.</p>
<p>This 22-mile creek, named for a romantic character in an 1855 hit poem,
connects everything that makes Minneapolis famous: the Mississippi
River, Minnehaha Falls, the Chain of Lakes, Lake Minnetonka.</p>
<p>It's a favorite of paddlers when conditions are right-and of
snowshoers in deep winter, when the water freezes.</p>
<p>In Minneapolis, parkland surrounds the last eight miles of the creek. In
mid-January, my friend Cathy and I started at Lynnhurst Park on the
south end of Lake Harriet.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The outlet from the lake was frozen, but a big flock of ducks was
keeping the creek open. On our canoe-route map, we read, &quot;Fish were once
so thick in spring at this spot that early settlers used pitchforks to
toss them onto the banks.&quot;</p>
<p>A little storybook bridge lay beyond the next curve. It was the first of
many delightful bridges, some high, some low, many with elegant steel
rails and graceful arches.</p>
<p>One craggy limestone bridge was lined by pale slabs that looked like
stalactites; another was in the Arts and Crafts style, adorned with
square slots that looked like battlements on castle towers.</p>
<p>For a while, we followed the creek on its banks. There are paved trails
on both sides, but our snowshoes let us stay close to the creekbed. We
passed a snowman with wild straw hair, orange-slice eyes and a pink
polka-dot scarf.</p>
<p>Its makers must have come from one of the handsome, half-timbered Tudor
houses lining Minnehaha Parkway. In Minneapolis, houses are set back but
still part of the scenery; in the affluent Edina and Minnetonka sections
of the creek, lined by private estates, they <em>are</em> the scenery.</p>
<p>Near the I-35W bridge, the creek widened and froze, and we walked the
rest of the way over solid ice.</p>
<p>An occasional runner passed on the trails, but still we saw only animal
tracks on the creek, and a pile of turkey feathers marked an apparent
skirmish. Four plumped-up, bright-red cardinals flitted inside a clump
of dogwoods on the bank, then scattered as we advanced.</p>
<p>At Portland, we passed the sculpture &quot;Cottontail on the Trail,&quot; a
landmark known as the big bronze bunny to hikers. A man and his dog
joined us on the creek, and we added our snowshoe prints to ski tracks
and mountain-bike treads.</p>

<p>As the creek approaches Lake Nokomis, the banks flatten. We passed the
first of two sledding hills, filled with shouting children, then the
Cedar Avenue bridge, the first one marked with its name.</p>
<p>We came to a fork at Lake Nokomis and turned toward Hiawatha Golf Course
instead of the lake. A sign hung on the next bridge: &quot;Canoeists Caution
Golf Playing Area.&quot;</p>
<p>Leaving the golf course, we walked onto the south end of Lake Hiawatha
and back onto the creek. There was more open water at 28th Avenue, so we
walked along the banks. When I tried again to walk on the creek near
some rushes, I broke through-good thing I was wearing waterproof
boots.</p>
<p>Then the creek widened and froze solid again. Soon, we saw the back of a
sandstone statue of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, alone in the middle of a
meadow, then the buoy marking the point where paddlers have to get off
the creek.</p>
<p>Just beyond is Minnehaha Park and the more famous statue of Minnehaha,
held in the arms of her lover Hiawatha. Beyond that, Minnehaha Falls
drops into a gorge and the creek flows another mile to the Mississippi
River.</p>
<p>In 1822, the 14-year-old son of the commander at Fort Snelling paddled
upstream with a runaway drummer boy and portaged around the big falls
and onto the creek.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Twenty-one miles later, they became the first Europeans to see Lake
Minnetonka. They were the vanguard of a wave of paddlers-and
snowshoers-that never has stopped.</p>
<h4>Ice trails in other places</h4>
<p>Frozen creeks, lakes and rivers are great places to snowshoe in cities
and countryside alike. In Chicago, the parks district holds <a href="http://www.chicagoparkdistrict.com/events/polar-adventure-days/">Polar
Adventure
Days</a>
on Northerly Island, across the harbor from Soldier Field.</p>
<p>You could also try snowshoeing on the North Branch of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/canoeing-chicago-river/">Chicago
River</a>, which barely has a
current. On rivers, always stay close to the shore.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.cityofmadison.com/parks/snowshoeing">Madison</a>, walk
from Lake Monona to Lake Waubesa and to Lake Wingra along Wingra Creek.</p>
<p>On the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/mississippi-winter/">Mississippi
River</a>, use
snowshoes to look for bald eagles in sloughs that are way too buggy to
explore in summer. Don't go onto the river unless you see ice fishermen
there, and even then, be very careful.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boundary-waters-tips/">Boundary Waters</a>, use
snowshoes to hike from lake to lake, over portages that are muddy in
summer. Be careful on lakes; they freeze at night and thaw during the
day, creating a crust that snowshoers might break through to slush.</p>
<p>On <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-north-shore/">Minnesota's North
Shore</a>, snowshoe up frozen
rivers through gorges. One of the most scenic is the Devil Track River
north of Grand Marais, lined by 200-foot cliffs.</p>
<p>The Caribou and Kadunce rivers also are good bets. Bring poles when you
have to snowshoe up and down hills.</p>
<p>Lake Superior never is safe, but rangers at Apostle Islands National
Lakeshore let people know when they can walk over it to the mainland
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/ice-caves-apostles/">ice caves</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/ely/">Ely</a>, walk to ancient pictographs
across frozen Hegman Lake.</p>

Skiers like Minnehaha Creek, too.

<p><em>Where to walk</em> : On the east end of the trail, the four-mile stretch
between Lynnhurst Park, on the south end of Lake Harriet, to Lake
Nokomis takes about three hours, less if the whole thing is frozen.
There's parking at Lake Nokomis Community Center.</p>
<p>There are two good coffee/treat stops on the east end of this stretch:
Mel-O-Glaze Bakery at 28th Avenue and Minnehaha Parkway and Nokomis
Beach Coffee at 28th Avenue and 50th Street, just off the easternmost
part of Lake Nokomis.</p>
<p>It's another two miles to Minnehaha Park. There's free parking at
Longfellow Gardens, just across Hiawatha Avenue from the park.</p>
<p>In Minneapolis, parkland adjoins the creek and you can get on anywhere.
On the west end of the creek, parkland adjoins the first two miles, and
there are landings at Gray's Bay Dam, Jidana Park and the Minnetonka
Civic Center.</p>
<p>Much of the creek in the middle is adjoined by private land, but there
are landings almost every mile.</p>
<p><em>Safety</em> : Snowshoes do distribute your weight, making walking on ice
safer. But it's best to walk with a friend.</p>
<p>On Minnehaha Creek, there are many places where water flows into the
creek and may keep pockets of water open: &quot;There's always a risk
because you have the potential of water flowing underneath the ice,&quot;
says Dr. Udai Singh, water-quality specialist of the Minnehaha Creek
Watershed District.</p>
<p>However, the creek is shallow, and you'll just get your feet wet if you
break through. If you want to take risks, wear waterproof boots or carry
an extra pair of socks and boots in a backpack.</p>
<p>Watch out for clumps of rushes on the banks-they capture snow, which
insulates the water. Snowshoers may be more likely to break through
there than in the middle of the creek.</p>
