<h2>In winter, ice creates scenic new routes for hikers.</h2>

<p>On Minnesota's North Shore, winter opens new avenues for explorers.</p>
<p>Miles of hiking trails already follow the gorges of rivers that flow
into Lake Superior. But why hike the trails when you can hike on the
river itself?</p>
<p>A frozen river takes you straight into the scenery — the slot canyons
of the Onion, the steep red cliffs of the Devil Track, the waterfalls of
the Baptism.</p>
<p>Snowshoeing up the rivers of the North Shore is not particularly
dangerous if you have any sense at all. And yet, it's not without
excitement.</p>
<p>Crusted snow and thin ice often conceal large pockets of air, and as we
walked up the Onion one February, we heard a loud boom behind us.</p>
<p>On the way back, we found a crater where four people and a dog suddenly
had plummeted at least a foot — not down to open water, but far enough
to cause hearts to stop.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>North Shore rivers aren't exactly quiet and serene in winter. We could
hear the Onion noisily gurgling under our feet, and at the Baptism
River's High Falls, water drummed against its cloak of ice like bongos.</p>
<p>You can see three waterfalls on the broad Baptism, and the Caribou is an
easy jaunt with a waterfall of its own.</p>
<p>But our favorite snowshoeing river was the little Onion, just south of Lutsen.</p>
<p>You can hop onto it from the Ray Berglund Wayside, and it feels like a secret,
though it's not. Its route through narrow slot canyons is a favorite of
locals, including Tofte photographer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThomasjSpenceImages">Tom
Spence</a>, whom we found in
a round opening he called the &quot;Onion theater&quot; and &quot;crying room.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can rarely get in here in summer; it's just too deep,&quot; he said.
&quot;Winter is the time to be here, that's for sure. I meant to go home
half an hour ago, but I kept saying, 'Oh, what's around this corner?' &quot;</p>
<p>Ice and snow changes the scenery every day. In the theater, icefalls
oozed down the pink rock, and tiny globes of ice hung across its wall
like Christmas lights.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baptism_high_falls.jpg" alt="Frozen High Falls on the Baptism River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Upstream, the gorge widened, and more snow had found its way onto the
river. Gaping slits in its crust were lined with ice crystals, dainty as
moth wings.</p>
<p>Our next stop was the Baptism River in Tettegouche State Park. From the
trailhead parking lot, we made our way down to the river.</p>
<p>Being farther from shore, this time we paid close attention to where
other people had walked, and we were surprised to see tracks going right
up to High Falls.</p>
<p>Miniature volcanoes of tan foam were erupting from the base of the
falls, and we could see bits of open water, so we admired it from a
distance.</p>
<p>It was Super Bowl Sunday, and we had that beautiful bowl all to
ourselves.</p>
<p>From High Falls, we walked downriver to Two Step Falls, hugging the
banks just to be safe, and back to our car.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We tried another river in Beaver Bay. From the riverside rest stop,
we walked up the Beaver River far enough to see a waterfall we didn't
have time to scale.</p>
<p>We weren't done with ice. We had slushy cosmopolitans waiting for us at
an ice bar at Grand Superior Lodge, just south of Gooseberry Falls State
Park.</p>
<p>Under a tent, there were two rooms, one with the ice bar and one with
animal skins over an ice bench and a fish sunk into ice over an ice
fireplace near an ice sink and an ice faucet.</p>
<p>&quot;People ask, 'What's the bar made of?' &quot; the bartender told us
with a smile. &quot; 'Does the faucet work?' &quot;</p>
<p>The next weekend, we snowshoed up Tischer Creek in Duluth's Congdon
Park, one of our favorite hikes in every season. But we got lured off
the creek when we noticed a freakishly large number of people traipsing
up the east side of its banks.</p>
<p>Curious, we followed them and ended up looking at a boreal owl sleeping
in a tree. The birders had come from all over the United States on a
moment's notice, just to add the owl to their life lists.</p>

<p>And once, we snowshoed up the Caribou River with a group. It was
flat, scenic and had a big waterfall — perfect for beginners.</p>
<p>We have more river gorges we want to explore. Photographer <a href="http://www.northshorephotoart.com/">Rudi
Hargesheimer</a>, a longtime board
member of the Superior Hiking Trail Association, also recommends the
Manitou, the Cascade and the Kadunce.</p>
<p>Along with Tischer Creek in Duluth, he likes Chester Creek, both
&quot;splendid little streams that equal those on the North Shore, and
they're right in the city.&quot;</p>
<p>The Beaver River is one of Hargesheimer's favorites because both banks
are private land, and traveling on the river itself is the only way to
see it.</p>
<p>To cover more ground, he likes to ski down the rivers with friends,
leaving one car at the beginning of the ski, up in the hills where
there's plenty of snow, and one at the river's mouth.</p>
<p>They make a day of it. On the Baptism, they start near Finland, and on
the Beaver, they start where Lax Lake Road/County Road 4 crosses the
river.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But it's tricky to navigate waterfalls on skis. On snowshoes, he says,
&quot;anything goes.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: River canyons of Minnesota's North Shore</h3>
<p><em>What to know:</em>  Snow insulates ice, so a thick snow cover is no
guarantee of safety on a river. Go with a buddy, and look for tracks of
other people.</p>
<p>If you're on snowshoes, you decrease your risk of breaking through ice.
In winter, most North Shore rivers have only a foot or two of water, but
you risk frostbite or even hypothermia if you get your feet wet far from
your vehicle.</p>
<p>Avoid the bases of waterfalls, where water circulates in deep pools and
keeps ice from forming.</p>
<p><em>What to bring:</em>  Snowshoes with crampons, poles and extra clothing,
especially socks.</p>
<p><em>Good rivers to explore:</em>  The rivers below are especially scenic,
shallow and easy to reach.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Tischer Creek in Duluth.</em>  Park half a block up from Superior Street at
32nd Avenue East. The Congdon Park Trail follows Tischer Creek 1½ miles
up the hillside.</p>
<p>The steep banks can be icy, so bring poles and ice crampons or cleats.</p>
<p><em>Beaver River at Mile 51 on the east edge of Beaver Bay.</em>  From County
Road 4 just up from Minnesota 61, there's a parking lot from which you
can walk to the river.</p>
<p><em>Baptism River at Mile 58.5 east of Silver Bay.</em>  From Minnesota 61,
take the Tettegouche State Park road (vehicle permit required) up to the
trailhead/campground parking lot.</p>
<p><em>Caribou River at Mile 71.3 between Little Marais and Schroeder.</em>
From the wayside parking lot, it's a flat and easy hike on the river to a waterfall.</p>
<p><em>Onion River at Mile 87 near Lutsen.</em> Park at the Ray Berglund Wayside,
less than half a mile west of the Sea Villas and the Cliff
Dweller motel and 3.7 miles west of Lutsen Lodge.</p>
<p><em>Devil Track River at Mile 114, four miles east of Grand Marais.</em>  Take
County Road 58 up from Minnesota 61, park at the Superior Hiking Trail
lot and head west into the river gorge.</p>
<p>The walls of this gorge are very tall and steep, so be especially
careful not to get in trouble.</p>
