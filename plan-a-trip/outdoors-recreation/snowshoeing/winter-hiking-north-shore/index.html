<h2>Snow and ice give intriguing new faces to the miles of trails above Lake Superior.</h2>

<p>In summer and fall, hikers by the thousands flock to the Superior Hiking Trail, in the Sawtooth Mountains above Minnesota's North Shore.</p>
<p>It's been called one of the nation's most beautiful trails. But in winter, this lush landscape is stripped down. The stark winter sun throws everything into high relief: Black lenticel pores pop out on the trunks of birch that are a brilliant white against the blue sky.</p>
<p>Sounds sharpen: the snapping and popping of trees in the cold, the crunch of snow underfoot, the grating croak of a raven. A coating of snow records the life � and, often, death � of small animals.</p>
<p>Humans who traverse the trail in winter are rewarded.</p>
<p>Curtains of leaves drop, revealing panoramic views of Lake Superior from many angles. There are no bugs, no mud, no sweat � and, on a 10-below day with 70-below wind chills, no people.</p>
<p>I sat in Coho Caf� in Tofte, giving myself a pep talk over cappuccino and a croissant. At Lutsen Mountains, a parking-lot attendant had warned me to keep my engine running, because two other cars had stalled. The man at the outfitters had said I�d walk only half an hour on the trail to Carlton Peak before I�d be caught by the ferocious wind.</p>
<p>ADS:4</p>
<p>But I drove three miles up the Sawbill Trail to the parking lot at Britton Peak, southern trailhead for the 196 kilometers of tracked and groomed trails in the North Shore Ski Trail System. It�s also a trailhead on the Superior Hiking Trail, with a stretch to Carlton Peak that often is used for snowshoeing and winter hiking.</p>
<p>I'd rented snowshoes with crampons for climbing, but when I saw how packed the trail was, I stowed them behind a fallen log and walked, crossing Carlton Creek and the wide, temptingly tracked Tofte ski trail, which begins a five-kilometer downhill schuss to the shore from the Britton Peak trailhead.</p>
<p>Another winter, I hiked to Carlton Peak in 70-below wind chills. It was so cold the forest�s trees were popping their skins, expanding as the moisture within them froze; the snapping sounded like the first raindrops before a thunderstorm. But the wind never found its way to me through the trees, and I was perfectly warm in mukluks, snowsuit and fleece balaclava.</p>
<p>In less than an hour, I was winding my way around the darkened heel of the peak, a moonscape of ice and frozen lichen on a wall of granite, and up to the sunny summit.</p>
<p>Lake Superior, about 50 degrees warmer than the air, was steaming away 924 feet below; in the distance, I could see a plume of vapor from the processing plant in Taconite Harbor, and miles and miles of hazy shoreline.</p>
<p>From there, the cold seemed rather exhilarating, and the rest of the three-mile hike was a cakewalk. And the next day, only a few degrees warmer but with less wind, seemed balmy.</p>
<p>This time, I walked the five-mile Split Rock River Loop, a favorite of the Superior Trail Hiking Association, the group of volunteers who maintain the trail. Newly fallen snow had frosted the fingerlike branches of baby firs and made the birches a paler shade of white.</p>
<p>Plump little cedar waxwings flitted around like Cinderella�s helpers as I followed the packed trail, high above the open yellow mouth of the Split Rock River.</p>
<p>There was plenty to look at: a small, frozen waterfall into a creek, looking just like stalactites in a cave. Piles of chewed-up pinecones left by a squirrel. Deer tracks into the woods. Coyote scat, bristling with the hair of some small, unfortunate mammal.</p>
<p>Soon, I noticed rows of snowshoe tracks on the surface of the river and descended the banks. I could hear gurgling under the ice, but it was good and thick, and I walked upriver until the red-rock walls of the gorge trailed away into riverbank.</p>
<p>The trail returns on the east side of the river, but I followed the riverbed back, climbing back to the western spur along a beaver trail lined with toppled aspen.</p>
<p>On the highway, sharp little flurries had replaced what, only a few steps inland, had been softly falling snow. I remembered something city people tend to forget: In the embrace of the forest, winter is much gentler.</p>
<p>Of course, that�s not news to people who live on the North Shore. Ann Russ, a Tofte naturalist who leads Saturday snowshoe hikes into the woods from Bluefin Bay and Cascade Lodge, loves winter for the serenity it gives to the forest and for what it reveals to those who venture there.</p>
<p>She shows it all to her followers, from the tracks of animals invisible in other seasons to a birch tree�s luminous peach underskin, unnoticed amid summer's greenery.</p>
<p>&quot;I really get a charge out of taking people out, and oohing and aahing about what we see,&quot; she says. &quot;The interesting thing about taking a walk in the woods is that we always see something, but we never know what it's going to be.&quot;</p>
