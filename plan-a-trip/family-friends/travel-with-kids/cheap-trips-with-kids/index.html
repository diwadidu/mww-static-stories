<p>When it comes to travel, it costs a lot less to make kids happy than
parents think.</p>
<p>Oh, kids are happy to let adults spend money on big-ticket trips —
Disney World, Six Flags, the Wisconsin Dells.</p>
<p>But what do they prefer? It's elemental, my dear parents: rocks, water
and sand.</p>
<p>No matter where I took my own kids, they always gravitated to places
where they could poke around on their own — cobblestone beaches, sand
dunes, river gorges, rock outcroppings.</p>
<p>When they were little, they'd squat and start sifting through pebbles
wherever we'd stop.</p>
<p>When they were older, they'd eschew arcades and entertainment centers
to jump between boulders or slide down dunes. It was amusing — and
easy on the wallet, too.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When they got older, I had them rate the local trips we've taken over
the years, and their choices were surprising.</p>
<p>The <em>Badlands and Black Hills</em> were the top pick for Peter (&quot;Climbing
is fun,&quot; he wrote on his survey), followed by
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/duluth/">Duluth</a> (&quot;climbing&quot;) and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/milwaukee-kids/">Milwaukee</a>, where we climbed on lakefront rocks
and saw a Brewers game.</p>
<p>For Madeleine, <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/">Minnesota's North
Shore</a> was No. 1 (&quot;so fun&quot;),
followed by a tie between <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/duluth/">Duluth</a>
(&quot;Everybody loves Duluth&quot;), the <strong>Circle Tour of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/">Lake Michigan</a></strong> (&quot;very good trip&quot;)
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/">Door County</a> (&quot;lots to do;
beautiful&quot;).</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/wisconsin-dells/">Wisconsin Dells</a> made their
Top 10, barely, but the Boundary Waters and Circus World Museum in
Baraboo didn't, though I know they liked them.</p>
<p>They liked <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/chicago-kids/">Chicago</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/madison-with-kids/">Madison</a>, too, though each town made only one
list.</p>
<p>It could be because those places don't have a lot of rocks, but I think
it's also because the &quot;attractions&quot; aren't as attractive to kids as
their own explorations. My kids, anyway, would rather explore on their
own than be shepherded around by a parent or guide.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/j/u/jumping_kids_crow_wing.jpg" alt="children jumping off raft at Minnesota resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Crow Wing Crest resort in northern Minnesota, children take a running
leap off a raft.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Their favorite week of the year is spent at a <em>lake resort</em> in northern
Minnesota, because they get cut loose to find their own fun. The place
has everything they like: rocks, water and sand, plus other kids.</p>
<p>When they were little, they splashed in the water and played with a
shovel and bucket in the sand.</p>
<p>When they grew older, they swam to the raft, paddled kayaks and biked on
the nearby trail.</p>
<p>Then, they played cutthroat volleyball, hung out in the wood-fired sauna
and stayed up late with the other teens.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, the kids decide what they'll do. One year at our lake
resort, kids were flitting all over the place as I sat on the beach with
Michelle Rademacher of Blaine, Minn., whose young daughter, Carly,
rarely was seen without a fishing rod in her hand.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;We went to Disney World this year, and I asked my kids, 'If you could
go to Disney World or the cabin, which would you pick?'&quot; Rademacher
said. &quot;And they said, 'The cabin.' &quot;</p>
<p>My children's Aunt Lynn lives in Orlando, so they've done Disney and
more. They've seen the sights in Europe and Mexico as well as New York,
Colorado, Utah, Oregon, Arizona and Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>But if they had to pick only one place to go, it'd be Minnesota lakes
country in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>For them, that's where all good things come together.</p>

<h2>Water</h2>
<p>A week at a <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/all-inclusive-resorts-minnesota/">lake
resort</a></strong>
is the best possible vacation for kids.</p>
<p>Use search engines to find a resort you'll like: On the <a href="http://www.minnesota-resorts.com">Community of
Minnesota Resorts</a> website, for
example, I get 41 possibilities when I ask for a resort with a beach,
game room and children's activities.</p>
<p>You can also search for last-minute openings and resorts with
campgrounds.</p>
<p>The CMR is a group of family-owned and -operated Minnesota resorts.
There are also search engines at <a href="https://www.exploreminnesota.com/places-to-stay/resorts">Explore
Minnesota</a> and
<a href="https://www.travelwisconsin.com/places-to-stay/resorts-lodges">Travel
Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<p>People in Minnesota and Wisconsin take these lake resorts for granted,
but be warned: Theme parks always will be around, but family resorts are
disappearing. Let's help keep them in business, so everyone can have a
week at the lake.</p>
<p>If you can't afford a week at a resort, ask about partial weeks; many
resorts allow short stays at the end of summer.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>If you can't afford a short stay, go
<a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/">camping</a> ; many campgrounds are much
like resorts.</p>
<p>And some campsites in national and state forests have their own
pine-fringed beaches, like the ones on Cass Lake's South Pike Bay,
which is on the paved, 17-mile Migizi Trail, where kids can bike or
skate.</p>
<h2>Rocks</h2>
<p>There's just something about kids and rocks. My kids have loved them
ever since they could crawl, maybe because they were both so close to
the ground. Even today, my tech-loving daughter is thrilled by ordinary
pieces of basalt, not to mention quartz and agates.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/duluth-kids/">Duluth</a></strong> is a lode of climbing rocks, which can be
found along the shoreline in Canal Park and also on the eastern edge of
town, on Brighton Beach in Kitchi-Gammi Park.</p>
<p>Kids love all of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-north-shore/">beaches on the North
Shore</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_rocks_madeleine.jpg" alt="A girl jumps over rocks on Duluth's Canal Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A girl jumps on the rocks that line Duluth's Canal Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Farther up the North Shore, the volcanic outcroppings of <em>Lighthouse
Point in</em> <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/visiting-two-harbors-minnesota/"><strong>Two
Harbors</strong></a>
are good for clambering around, and so is the rock at <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/gooseberry-falls/"><strong>Gooseberry
Falls State
Park</strong></a> in
summer (bring old sneakers or water shoes) or winter.</p>
<p>The pebble beach in front of <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/lutsen-lodge-north-shore/">Lutsen
Lodge</a> holds
all kinds of treasures, and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/finding-agates/">agate-hunters</a> should check
out the <em>mouth of the Beaver River</em> , just east of Beaver Bay, and
<em>Cutface Creek Wayside</em> , west of Grand Marais.</p>
<p>The best playground of all is Artists' Point in <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Grand
Marais</a></strong>
, a pile of fractured rock Peter once called &quot;my idea of the perfect
place to play.&quot;</p>
<p>If you have time, keep going into Ontario and around to Michigan and
Wisconsin: The <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/circle-tour-lake-superior/">Circle Tour of Lake
Superior</a></strong>
is one of the very best trips to take with kids, even small ones,
because there's always a pebble beach to stop at.</p>
<p>For older kids and adults, there are fur posts, shipwrecks, lighthouses
and ore boats to watch.</p>
<p>For a trip in Minnesota, drive over to <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/taylors-falls-minnesota/">Interstate State Park at
Taylors
Falls</a></strong> ,
where your little Pebbles and Bam-Bam can explore a rocky playground
that includes the Devil's Parlor, the Bake Oven and the 67-foot
Bottomless Pit.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, just south of the Dells, explore <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake/">Devil's Lake State
Park</a></strong> .</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/l/sleeping_bear_platte_girls.jpg" alt="Girls run into the Platte River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h2>Sand</h2>
<p>When my daughter said the <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-circle-tour/">Circle Tour of Lake
Michigan</a></strong>
was her second-favorite trip, I was shocked, because she's generally
not fond of following her mother from one new place to another.</p>
<p>But she liked it all, citing the meat pasties on the Upper Peninsula,
the hilltop fort and pebble beaches of Mackinac Island and the sand at
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/sleeping-bear-dunes/">Sleeping Bear Dunes National
Lakeshore</a></strong> .</p>
<p>Unlike Minnesota's North Shore, the leeward side of Lake Michigan has
sand, tons of sand. It's lined by beaches, including Sleeping Bear
Dunes, a 35-mile-long playground.</p>
<p>Kids in particular like to do the Dune Climb, up a 150-foot inland dune
that seems to rise out of nowhere.</p>
<p>They like to walk to the 450 Dune, a sheer wall of sand that falls 450
feet into Lake Michigan. They like to hang out at the mouth of the
Platte River, where they can run down small dunes into the crystal-clear
water and dart between the warm Platte and cold Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>My friend Rebecca took her three children on a trip to Sleeping Bear
Dunes, camping in the state parks that line the coast, and she reports
they adored the dunes — climbing and digging but mostly playing soccer
on them, even sacrificing swim time so they could play more.</p>
<p>And of course, they loved taking the S.S. Badger car ferry across Lake
Michigan between Ludington, Mich., and Manitowoc, Wis.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_kids_climbing.jpg" alt="Kids climbing on Artists' Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Grand Marais, Minn., kids adore climbing on the rocks of Artists'
Point.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-michigan/lake-michigan-tour/">Lake Michigan with
kids</a>.</p>
<p>There are more big dunes on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, in the
little fishing village of Grand Marais. Just to the west, at the edge of
<strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/michigan-pictured-rocks-national-lakeshore/">Pictured Rocks National
Lakeshore</a></strong>
, the 300-foot Grand Sable Dunes rise at the edge of Grand Sable Lake.</p>
<p>They're a stop on the Circle Tour of Lake Superior. On the other end of
the national lakeshore, in the town of Munising, there's a good
swimming beach at Sand Point, with a delicate 50-foot waterfall to see
on the way.</p>
<p>In Duluth, hike the four-mile <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/minnesota-wisconsin-points/">Park Point
Trail</a></strong> , on the
spit of sand that created Duluth-Superior Harbor.</p>
<p>Starting at the airport, across the Aerial Lift Bridge from Canal Park,
it passes through a thicket of red pine and emerges onto sand dunes,
which my kids like to schuss down on their feet, like snowboarders.</p>
<p>There are smaller dunes beyond, but watch out for poison ivy. At the end
of the trail, at the Superior Entry, a breakwall curves around a
polished-pebble beach that also holds a trove of bleached driftwood.</p>
<p>Most of these places cost nothing to visit. Time, however, is precious.</p>
<p>Go now, because soon enough, your kids will be gravitating not to rocks
and sand but to iPods and cell phones. And that will be a hard place,
indeed.</p>
