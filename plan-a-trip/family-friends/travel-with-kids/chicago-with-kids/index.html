<h2>For curious children, this inviting city overflows with treasures.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_kids_art_institute.jpg" alt="Kids outside the Art Institute of Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For parents, it's hard to predict what kids will like best about
Chicago.</p>
<p>During spring break one year, my friend Rebecca and I took our children
to Chicago, with an itinerary that alternated visits to museums with
visits to zoos and parks.</p>
<p>Pitting high culture against popular culture, we knew what the biggest
hits would be: the Ferris wheel at Navy Pier, Lincoln Park Zoo, the
elevated train, deep-dish pizza, perhaps the Museum of Science and
Industry.</p>
<p>But we were wrong.</p>
<p>This is what they really liked: Miniature French boudoirs and English
drawing rooms at the Art Institute. Seahorses disguised as seaweed at
Shedd Aquarium. Quesadillas and freshly squeezed limeade at Frontera,
one of the hippest restaurants in town.</p>
<p>They loved the museums, where they learned that if it's naked, it's
French, and if it's sharp and dangerous, it's German.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The skyscrapers for which Chicago is famed, however, was not a hit. They
were more interested in the beggars sitting beneath them.</p>
<p>In Chicago, our five children learned a lot about the world. And we
learned a lot about them.</p>
<p>Our first stop was Shedd Aquarium. Climbing its steps, in the middle of
Chicago's lakefront Museum Campus, we could see the skyline stretching
north and south and sailboats bobbing in the harbor.</p>
<p>Inside, we watched dolphins jumping and heard beluga whales &quot;talking&quot;
with high-pitched squeaks. We walked from hall to hall, looking at sting
rays as big as bathroom rugs, porcelain anemones with lavender-tipped
arms, green moray eels peering out from crevices with maniacal eyes.</p>
<p>We could hardly stop watching the sleek river otters at play: &quot;If
there's such a thing as reincarnation, that's what I want to be next
time around,&quot; said my daughter Madeleine.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_hippo.jpg" alt="A hippo at the Lincoln Park Zoo." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A baby hippo snuffles in the water at the free Lincoln Park Zoo.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But nothing captivated us like the leafy seadragon, a foot-long seahorse
with floating appendages that could not be distinguished from seaweed.</p>
<p>&quot;They're so weird, they're the weirdest thing in the world,&quot; said my
son Peter, even after watching a video of a male seahorse giving birth
to 150 babies.</p>
<h3>Picking out dinner</h3>
<p>From Shedd, we drove down Lake Shore Drive to Water Tower Place, where
we parked, expensively, and went to dinner.</p>
<p>We should have gone next door to the top of the 94-floor John Hancock
Center, for the view of the city at sunset. And we could have walked two
blocks from our hotel to the Chicago Cultural Center, to hear a free
Scandinavian folk-music concert under the world's largest Tiffany dome.</p>
<p>They were the first of many concessions to fatigue.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The next morning, Peter wanted to go back to Water Tower Place, to give
money to a woman who had asked us the night before. &quot;She was wearing
designer jeans,&quot; Madeleine said scornfully.</p>
<p>&quot;She bought those before she lost her job,&quot; Peter replied. But we
persuaded him to walk to the Art Institute instead.</p>
<p>It was Van Gogh's birthday, so we celebrated by looking at his famous
&quot;Bedroom&quot; portrait, in a room that also contained Rousseau's
&quot;Waterfall,&quot; Toulouse-Lautrec's &quot;At the Moulin Rouge,&quot; two Gauguins
and, as if those weren't breathtaking enough, Seurat's &quot;Sunday
Afternoon on the Island of the Grande Jatte.&quot;</p>
<p>Peter loved walking close to the Seurat, then fading back to see how the
famous dots changed. But he thought the Thorne Miniature Rooms, dozens
of intricately decorated interiors from the 13th century on, were even
cooler.</p>
<p>Passing a variety of statues in the buff — &quot;Yep, it's French,&quot;
Madeleine said of Rodin's &quot;Adam&quot; — we made our way to another kid
favorite, the Arms and Armor Hall. Peter's eyes glittered as he gazed at
a German pole ax.</p>
<p>&quot;If you'd get me one of those, you wouldn't have to get me a
babysitter, because if a robber broke in, Bam! I'd scare him away,&quot; he
said.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Welcome to the blues</h3>
<p>Then I hustled everyone back down Michigan Avenue to the Chicago
Cultural Center for a free concert.</p>
<p>That day, the Matthew Skoller Band, regulars at the House of Blues, was
paying tribute to local blues harmonica pioneer Sonny Boy Williamson,
born that day in 1914.</p>
<p>It was a perfect introduction for children &amp;mdashg; Skoller's hilarious
harmonica imitation of a woman scolding a man over the phone told them
exactly what the blues are, without the adult language.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the three oldest children and I left Rebecca with
Jonathan, 6, and Rachel, 2, and hopped a taxi to Navy Pier, which has a
Ferris wheel, carousel, children's museum, shops, restaurants and docks
for excursion boats and the schooner Windy.</p>
<p>We rode the Ferris wheel, which was too slow for us, then went into the
Children's Museum, where their favorite feature was a Treehouse Trail
that, considering the admission price, was too much like McDonald's
Playland.</p>
<p>Leaving, we watched the resident Improv Comedy Troupe perform a
3½-minute version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; on a raised stage in the
middle of the mall.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>After stuffed pizza that night at friendly Bacino's, Peter and I
strolled 12 blocks down Michigan Avenue.</p>
<p>The Magnificent Mile's temples of commerce shimmered in the evening:
Pottery Barn, Banana Republic, Crate &amp; Barrel, the Apple store.</p>
<p>Near the neo-Gothic Tribune Tower, Peter gave a man sitting on the
sidewalk two pennies he had found.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we should give all homeless people $30,&quot; he said. &quot;It makes
me feel really good to give money.&quot;</p>
<h3>Just like an animal</h3>
<p>The next day, we caught the bus to free Lincoln Park Zoo, where
volunteers were bringing out the residents in the Children's Zoo — a
hedgehog, a parrot, a screech owl named Otis.</p>
<p>In the primate house, we watched a mandrill, which the children
immediately identified as the &quot;Lion King&quot; monkey, and a group of
Western Lowland gorillas, which included a lively 10-month-old baby.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_windy_kids.jpg" alt="The schooner Windy in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the schooner Windy, children help "pirates" hoist the sails.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Something about the way she played seemed familiar to us.</p>
<p>&quot;She looks just like Rachel, except she's black and furry,&quot; 9-year-old
Ben finally said.</p>
<p>The zoo café was packed, so we walked the seven blocks west to Oz Park,
and while the children were playing on the wooden towers of Dorothy's
Playlot, I fetched sandwiches from the nearby Potbelly Deli.</p>
<p>Then we took the El back to the Loop, soaking up great views of the city
as we clattered around each curve.</p>
<p>The children still weren't out of energy. That evening, Rebecca and I
watched them careening all over the sidewalk as we walked along Michigan
Avenue to dinner at Panda Express.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the excitement of the city stimulates them,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>We needed energy the next day for free day at the Museum of Science and
Industry, which was packed and clamorous. By 10 a.m., there was already
an hour's wait for the submarine tour, but we stuck it out, looking at
propaganda posters as we moved along.</p>
<p>The German U-505, seized off the coast of French Africa two days before
D-Day, was the first enemy vessel to be captured on the high seas since
the War of 1812, and it contained the codes to the German shipping
routes.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_oak_beach_girls.jpg" alt="little girls at oak street beach in chicago" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Little girls play on Oak Street Beach, a stone's throw from the
Magnificent Mile.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's a thrilling story that, unfortunately, was mostly lost on the
children, though they were interested in the scatological aspects of
life at 120 degrees, with two toilets and no showers for 60 men.</p>
<p>We moved on to the giant heart, the flight simulators, the LEGO room,
the 1911 ice-cream parlor in Yesterday's Main Street. The Museum of
Science and Industry is a wonderful place, but after four hours, we were
exhausted.</p>
<h3>Fashionable food for kids</h3>
<p>Later, when Rebecca suggested we go to Frontera Grill for dinner, I
thought she was insane. An Internet restaurant guide had praised its
&quot;extraordinary décor, extraordinary service and near-perfect food&quot; but
included no mention of families.</p>
<p>We went anyway, and it turned out to be the hit of the week. The walls
were covered with brightly colored folk art, and giant papier-mache
bears hung in the rafters.</p>
<p>The children gobbled quesadillas and taquitos off the children's menu,
and I had a fabulous plate of cobia with garlic achiote and garlic
mashed potatoes and parsnips. The pickiest kid of all was the happiest.</p>
<p>&quot;These quesadillas are a fiesta for my taste buds,&quot; Ben said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_lakefront_family_bicycling.jpg" alt="A family bicycles on Chicago's Lakefront Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was an easy walk back to the hotel. When we stopped at the White Hen
Pantry to pick up breakfast pastries, I noticed Peter's face was
splotched with soot, from hands trailed along bridge rails. The clerk
also noticed, and, bringing out a wet cloth, cleaned him up.</p>
<p>I have to say I'm biased about Chicago. I always have a great time
there, and I always run across the friendliest people. Now I've
indoctrinated my children. Funny — they don't seem to mind a bit.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Chicago with kids</h3>
<p><em>Getting around:</em> For families, taxis to Navy Pier and the Museum Campus
are economical.</p>
<p>It's also very easy to use the <a href="http://www.transitchicago.com">CTA</a>,
which operates subway/El trains and buses.</p>
<p>Get a multi-day pass. They're for sale at airport stops (also museums,
Navy Pier and visitors centers), and you also can order the passes
online, with no shipping charges.</p>
<p><em>Planning an itinerary:</em>  I planned around <a href="http://www.choosechicago.com/articles/view/FREE-MUSEUM-DAYS-IN-CHICAGO/556/">free days at the
museums</a>, which change frequently (and are reserved mainly for Illinois
residents). You'll save the most at <a href="http://www.sheddaquarium.org">Shedd
Aquarium</a>,  the <a href="http://www.artic.edu">Art Institute of
Chicago</a>, <a href="http://www.adlerplanetarium.org">Adler
Planetarium</a> and the <a href="http://www.fieldmuseum.org">Field Museum of
Natural History</a>.</p>
<p>Because waits already are long at the <a href="http://www.msichicago.org">Museum of Science and
Industry</a>, it may be best to avoid free day
there.</p>

<p><em>Accommodations:</em>  The big question for families: Pool or no pool? Kids
like them, but you may not get much sightseeing in if your kids just
want to play in the pool.</p>
<p>You'll probably want a room that includes breakfast or has a
kitchenette. At Grand and State, a short walk to Michigan Avenue, the
<a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/chihwhw-homewood-suites-chicago-downtown/">Hilton Homewood
Suites</a>
has two-room suites with kitchenettes, a pool and buffet breakfast.</p>
<p>At State and Ohio, the <a href="http://www.embassysuiteschicago.com">Embassy
Suites</a> has a pool and rooms with
mini-fridge and microwave.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/ordmdhf-hilton-chicago-magnificent-mile-suites/">Hilton Suites
Chicago</a>
has a pool and two-room suites with mini-fridge and microwave. It's
near the Oak Street Beach and two blocks from Water Tower Place, with
its eight movie screens and Foodlife.</p>
<p>Larger families can get a great deal at a hostel. The <a href="https://freehandhotels.com/chicago/">Freehand
Hotel/Hostel</a>, in a former 1927 hotel
in River North, has a communal kitchen as well as bar, cafe and
activities concierge. It has rather chic private rooms, even a
penthouse, as well as bunks in a shared quad.</p>
<p>In the South Loop, Hostelling International  <a href="http://www.hichicago.org/">family
hostel</a> has a carpeted great room with
foosball, ping-pong and a pool table.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://www.getawayhostel.com/">Chicago Getaway Hostel</a> near
Lincoln Park, you can get a private room with shared bath or share a
quad, with breakfast included.</p>
<p>Closer to Navy Pier, the <a href="https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/chidmhx-hampton-chicago-downtown-magnificent-mile/">Hampton Inn
Chicago</a> on Huron Street has a 40th-floor rooftop outdoor
pool and includes breakfast.</p>
<p>And for something a little different, spend the night in a museum. Shedd
Aquarium, the Field Museum, Adler Planetarium and the Museum of Science
and Industry offer sleepovers for children and their parents. For more,
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/museum-family-overnights/">Nights at the museum</a>.</p>
<p><em>Dining:</em>  It's easy to eat well for very little at delis. Cosi, the
Corner Bakery, Caffe Baci and Chipotle all are on Michigan near the
Cultural Center, and L'Appetito, a great Italian place, is at the foot
of the John Hancock Tower.</p>
