<h2>Like Oz, Green Bay glows green and gold.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/green_bay_curly_lambeau.jpg" alt="A statue of Curly Lambeau in Green Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>The man with the big, Dentyne smile and Marlboro voice slammed his fist
into his palm.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay, here's the game plan,&quot; he bellowed. &quot;No. 1! You WILL see
Lambeau Field. You WILL see the press box. You WILL see the executive
skyboxes. You WILL sit in the club seats and see a video.</p>
<p>&quot;So where are you all from? How many of you are not Packer fans?
Ma'am, you have my condolences. The rest of this group, we know the
Packers are the best team in the NFL this year.</p>
<p>&quot;OK now!&quot; he shouted. &quot;Gene and I have fine-tuned this tram. When
it hears the words 'Go Pack Go' it'll turn over, but it can't just
be 'Go Pack Go.' It has to be . . .&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;GO PACK GO!&quot; we screamed.</p>
<p>The indomitable spirits of Curly Lambeau and Vince Lombardi were at full
force in Grant Turner, who should have been portraying coaches in
Hollywood but instead was leading tours of Green Bay's Lambeau Field
after retiring from — what else? — coaching high-school football.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Green Bay, Wis., is not just the home of the Packers, it's the throne
of the Packers. The city motto is a double-entendre: &quot;We Know How to
Play.&quot;</p>
<p>The Pack is in the supermarkets, the schools, the bars and, especially,
on the pages of the Green Bay Press-Gazette, in whose newsroom the team
was organized in 1919.</p>
<p>&quot;Green Bay would survive without the Packers,&quot; associate editor Tom
Perry mused in one column. &quot;. . . Green Bay would continue to exist
without the Packers about the way a junkie continues to exist on skid
row.&quot;</p>
<p>Green Bay is not much bigger than some big-city suburbs. But it's the
oldest city in Wisconsin and occupies a choice spot, at the foot of Lake
Michigan's Green Bay and around the mouth of the Fox River.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/green_bay_zippin.jpg" alt="Zippin Pippin in Green Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bay Beach Amusement Park boasts the Zippin Pippin, a replica of Elvis
Presley's favorite ride in Memphis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It was a base for fur traders in the 17th century and later became a
thoroughfare for industrialists.</p>
<p>For tourists, it's the gateway to the northwoods and to the Door
Peninsula.</p>
<p>Those who spend time in Green Bay itself will find a modest but pleasant
town with a college campus and restaurants, craft breweries and shops
springing up in the old port, railroad and tavern districts.</p>
<p>It has bona-fide attractions: the National Railroad Museum, the Neville
Public Museum, Weidner Center for the Performing Arts and one of
Wisconsin's favorite family destinations, the old-fashioned Bay Beach
Amusement Park, where most rides cost 25 or 50 cents.</p>
<p>But mainly, Green Bay is Titletown USA. That refers to the Packers, who
have won more national championships than any other NFL team. But
townsfolk have claimed a title of their own — Best Fans in the NFL.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The proof is in the numbers. Tickets to games in Lambeau Field have been
sold out since 1960, and there are more than 100,000 names on the
waiting list. That's about the population of Green Bay, where TVs
everywhere, even in supermarkets, tune in on game days.</p>
<p>In fact, more people own the Packers than can go to games. The team,
publicly owned since 1923, increased its shareholders to 111,031 during
a 1997-98 offering of $200 shares.</p>
<p>They don't appreciate in value or pay dividends, and they can't be
sold. But each one is a piece of the Packers, and they were snapped up
by people in all 50 states.</p>
<p>We had more fun with numbers after Coach Grant delivered us to the big,
green sheet-metal doughnut of Lambeau Field and turned us over to
another guide, Sara. How much did the Packers pay to join the NFL in
1921? $50. How much does it cost to buy an NFL franchise today? At
least $1 billion.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/green_bay_hornung.jpg" alt="Statue of Paul Hornung at Packers Heritage Plaza." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Halfback Paul Hornung is one of the figures in Packers Heritage Plaza.
During the 1960 season, he scored 176 points, an NFL record that stood
for 46 years.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>When Sara found out some of us were from Minnesota, she held out her
bare fist. &quot;What's this?&quot; she asked. &quot;It's a Vikings Super Bowl
ring! Ha! They don't have one!&quot;</p>
<p>A tour of Lambeau Field is fascinating for its window into Packermania.
And the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame is a window into the team that
inspired it.</p>
<p>Colorful exhibits tell the story of the team, first sponsored by a
meat-packing company. Founder and pioneering coach Curly Lambeau led it
to four of its  national championships, 1929-31 and 1944, but it's
Vince Lombardi's famous gap-toothed grin that is seen everywhere.</p>
<p>His tenure, between 1959 and 1967, is considered the glory years, during
which he led the Packers to five national titles, including the first
two Super Bowls. The highly quotable Lombardi is best known for his
motto &quot;Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing.&quot;</p>
<p>But it was his never-say-die spirit — &quot;You are never beaten, time
just runs out on you&quot; — that made him patron saint of Packers fans,
who endured a long dry spell until quarterback Brett Favre led the team
to a Super Bowl victory after the 1996 season.</p>
<p>The Favre era ended after the 2007 season, and quarterback Aaron Rodgers
led the Pack to another Super Bowl victory after the 2010 season.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/green_bay_trail.jpg" alt="Fox River State Trail in Green Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Fox River State Trail downtown is lined with sculptures.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's much more in the museum — Vince Lombardi's office, a replica
of the team locker room, greatest-games highlights and enough trivia and
statistics to keep a Packers fan supplied with bar talk year-round.</p>
<p>But only one number is really important, and it's the envy of every
other city with a major sports franchise.</p>
<p>And that's the odds that the Packers will leave Green Bay. The answer
is a big, fat 0, because no shareholder can own more than 4.2 percent of
the team, and if it ever were to be sold, profits would be turned over
to charity.</p>
<p>To the townsfolk, all other numbers are just gravy.</p>
