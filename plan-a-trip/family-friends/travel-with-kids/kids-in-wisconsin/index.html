<h2>From farm to city to beach, the state is one big playground for children.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/devils_lake_beach.jpg" alt="The beach at Devil's Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Baraboo, Devil's Lake is said to be the cleanest and clearest in
the state.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Over the years, my children logged many crossings of the St. Croix
River.</p>
<p>Like all who are young at heart, we love traveling in Wisconsin. Not
only is it beautiful, but it also tends to produce people who remember
how much fun it was to be a kid.</p>
<p>Take Laura Ingalls Wilder and Caddie Woodlawn, whose adventures were
recounted in famous children's books.</p>
<p>And the Ringling Brothers' youthful spectacles in Baraboo grew into the
world's biggest circus.</p>
<p>Thanks to them, it's really fun to be a kid in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>When they were younger, my children were thrilled by the Big Top Circus
in Baraboo, the water parks in the Dells, the vintage-train rides out of
Osceola.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When they grew older, they began to appreciate the theaters and shops of
Door County, the counterculture atmosphere of Madison's State Street
and baseball games under the retractable roof of Milwaukee's Miller
Park.</p>
<p>But their favorite spots weren't always the biggest or best-known
attractions. They loved picking blueberries in the bluffs near Laura
Ingalls Wilder's birthplace and playing with puppies on Amish farms in
Vernon County.</p>
<p>They loved any beach on Lake Superior or Lake Michigan, especially if it
had rocks on which they could climb.</p>
<p>Not all kids like the same things, of course. Still, it's a good bet
that any of them can have a good time in the Badger State. After all,
said John Ringling, one thing we never lose is &quot;the universal instinct
to be young again.&quot;</p>
<p>Below are some of Wisconsin's greatest destinations, for young and old.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baraboo_clowns_kids.jpg" alt="At Circus World, a clown poses with a boy." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Circus World, a clown poses with a graduate of the daily clown class.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/circus-world-baraboo/">Baraboo</a></h3>
<p>Who doesn't like a circus? Along the Baraboo River at the Ringlings'
old winter quarters, <a href="http://circusworld.wisconsinhistory.org">Circus World
Museum</a> includes an authentic
Big Top Circus that has all the classics-jugglers, clowns,
aerialists and illusionists. Be sure to spend the entire day.</p>
<p>Just to the south, <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/devils-lake/">Devil's Lake State
Park</a> has one of the
state's most popular beaches on the state's clearest lake. Older
children will love climbing around on the boulders and rocks that
surround the lake, as well as hiking on the spectacular East and West
Bluff trails.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/">Door County</a></h3>
<p>This peninsula in Lake Michigan has fine restaurants, shops, B&amp;Bs, music
festivals and outdoor theaters, so many people think of it as an adult
getaway.</p>
<p>But Door County is lined by sand beaches on which little kids can spend
hours, and older kids will find lots of chances to bicycle, sail, swim
and explore-and there's even a drive-in theater.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/door-county-outdoors/">Outdoors in Door
County</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/green_bay_amusement_park.jpg" alt="Rides at Bay Beach Amusement Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Most rides at Bay Beach Amusement Park in Green Bay cost 50 cents.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/green-bay-kids/">Green Bay</a></h3>
<p>Once, many towns had places like <a href="https://greenbaywi.gov/445/Bay-Beach">Bay Beach Amusement
Park</a>; now, Green Bay's
city-owned park is a rare treasure.</p>
<p>It's peaceful, wholesome and scenic, and rides are a bargain — $1
for a ride on the Zippin Pippin, a replica of Elvis' favorite roller
coaster; 50 cents for the Ferris wheel, Scrambler, Tilt-A-Whirl and
Yo-Yo; and only 25 cents to go down a giant slide.</p>
<p>On many Mondays and Wednesdays, there are Teen Nights for high-school
kids, featuring free rides and a live radio broadcast. It's on the Lake
Michigan shore east of downtown.</p>
<p>Of course, there's one other little attraction in Green Bay. Little
Packers fans can tread the hallowed grounds of Lambeau Field and absorb
nuggets of Vince Lombardi's wisdom — &quot;Winning isn't everything;
it's the only thing&quot; — at the 25,000-square-foot Packers Hall of
Fame.</p>

<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/indulgent-retreats/hayward-wisconsin-shops-inns/">Hayward</a></h3>
<p>It's known for big fish, big lakes-and big men swinging axes and
chain saws.</p>
<p>Hayward still is a lumber town, and muscle-bound jacks and jills perform
six days a week in the summer, entertaining visitors with speed
climbing, logrolling, log-jousting and axe-throwing at the Lumberjack
Bowl.</p>
<p>On the last weekend of July, see the best of the best compete in the
Lumberjack World Championships, where the lithe and speedy athletes from Hayward often dominate.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/lumberjacks-hayward/">Hayward's
lumberjacks</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/lac-du-flambeau-ojibwe-culture/">Lac du Flambeau</a></h3>
<p>This is lakes country, and the busy resort town
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/minocqua-wisconsin-lake-vacation/">Minocqua</a> is
nearby. But the village of Lac du Flambeau has retained a low-key
atmosphere as well as northwoods traditions.</p>
<p>Kids can meet local Ojibwe and learn about their traditions at the
George W. Brown Jr. Ojibwe Museum and Cultural Center and at the weekly
powwows at the Waaswaaganing Indian Bowl, where everyone who wants to
dance is invited into the circle.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madeline_sand_sculpture.jpg" alt="A sand sculpture on Madeline Island." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
For Madeline Island's sandcastle competition, children pitch in and
often create their own.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/madeline-island-wisconsin/">Madeline Island</a></h3>
<p>There are no go-karts, water parks or fast-food restaurants on the
largest of the Apostles, but children will find some of the region's
more charming pleasures.</p>
<p>For the annual Fourth of July parade, visiting children are invited to
make papier-mache puppets at a drop-in workshop. For the annual
sand-castle competition at Big Bay State Park in August, children are
asked not only to create sand sculpture but to create &quot;stories&quot; about
them as well.</p>
<p>Of course, the beaches on Lake Superior are a big draw, and adventurous
teens can explore by kayak or bicycle, perhaps dropping by Tom's Burned
Down Cafe, where &quot;Normal is just a setting on a washing machine.&quot;</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/madison-with-kids/">Madison</a></h3>
<p>For such a college town, this city is remarkably child-friendly, with a
children's museum, a children's theater and regular free concerts,
storytelling and festivals at the Overture Center for the Arts on State
Street. Of course, it's teens who will most appreciate the iconoclastic
pleasures of State Street.</p>
<p>In summer, go to Capitol Square for the weekly Dane County Farmers
Market and a tour of the gleaming white Capitol. On the other end of
State Street go to the lakefront terrace of the Memorial Union and rent
a canoe or listen to music.</p>
<p>And visit Henry Vilas Zoo any time, where admission still is free.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/milwaukee_discovery_world.jpg" alt="Discovery World in Milwaukee" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Milwaukee's Discovery World, kids can explore technology and the
natural sciences.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/milwaukee-kids/">Milwaukee</a></h3>
<p>This pint-size big city is a great place to take children, especially in
the summer, when festivals are held every weekend and beaches are open
along Lake Michigan, some with rocks for climbing.</p>
<p>For nonstop views of the lake, rent a <a href="https://bublrbikes.org/">Bublr
bike</a> and ride along the Oak Leaf Trail,
stopping to tour the 1888 North Point Lighthouse.</p>
<p>Downtown, the Milwaukee Public Museum has been a favorite for
generations, with dinosaur exhibits, a butterfly wing and a
turn-of-the-century downtown with cobbled lanes.</p>
<p>Red trolley cars take baseball fans to Miller Park, an old-style
ballpark with a retractable roof. And even kids love watching the
Milwaukee Art Museum's giant &quot;wings&quot; fold and unfold.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Osceola</h3>
<p>The golden era of passenger trains is alive and well in the St. Croix
River town of Osceola in western Wisconsin, where passenger trains on
the <a href="https://transportationmuseum.org/">Osceola &amp; St. Croix Valley
Railway</a> leave on summer weekends
for Dresser, Wis., and Marine on St. Croix in Minnesota, reached by a
swing bridge.</p>
<p>Run by volunteers from the Minnesota Transportation Museum, the big
locomotives give young people a glimpse at a long-gone era; for an extra
treat, book tickets on the pizza train.</p>
<p>There are also vintage-train rides in nearby Spooner and in Laona, North
Freedom and East Troy. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/vintage-trains/train-rides-midwest/">Riding the
rails</a>.</p>
<h3>Pepin</h3>
<p>In the 1870s, Pa Ingalls left the family home on the bluff above Pepin
-twice. Today, people flock to the lovely area. His daughter Laura
also loved the woods and her &quot;little gray house made of logs&quot;; it was
the location of her first book, &quot;Little House in the Big Woods.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/e/pepin_3_laura_lookalikes.jpg" alt="Laura look-alikes compete in Pepin." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Laura look-alikes compete during Laura Ingalls Wilder Days in Pepin.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the village, the Pepin Historical Museum tells what life was like in
Laura Ingalls Wilder's day, and the log cabin where she was born is
re-created in the hills seven miles above town, on County Road CC.</p>
<p>In September, the town holds Laura Ingalls Wilder Days, with a parade,
puppet theater and Laura Look-Alike contest.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ingalls-wilder/laura-ingalls-wilder-sites/">Laura
land</a>.</p>
<p>Just up Lake Pepin, in the bluffs above Maiden Rock, children can
exercise their hunter-gatherer instincts at <a href="http://www.rushriverproduce.com">Rush River
Produce</a>, where blueberry season
starts around the Fourth of July.</p>
<p>It's three miles up County Road A, with a spectacular view of the
surrounding valleys.</p>
<h3>Spooner</h3>
<p>For kids, pizza comes with the scenery on a ride along the Namekagon
River on the Wisconsin <a href="http://www.spoonertrainride.com">Great Northern
Railroad</a> out of Spooner.</p>
<p>In town, tour the <a href="http://spoonerhatchery.com/">state fish hatchery</a>,
and go to the <a href="http://www.spoonerrodeo.com">Spooner Rodeo</a> in July.</p>
<p>Just to the north in Trego, at the junction of U.S. 53 and 63, you can
rent tubes, canoes and kayaks for floating down the Namekagon River.
<a href="http://www.jackscanoerental.com">Jack's</a> and <a href="http://www.logcabin-resort.com/">Log Cabin
Resort</a> both rent tubes and boats and
provide shuttles.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/downsville_caddie_house.jpg" alt="The Caddie Woodlawn house near Downsville, Wis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
After competing in Downsville's annual Caddie Look-Alike Contest,
little girls run into Caddie Woodlawn's 1856 house.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Spring Valley and Downsville</h3>
<p>The formations of <a href="http://www.acoolcave.com">Crystal Cave</a>
near Spring
Valley will kick a child's imagination into high gear; it was a boy who
discovered it and later explored it with his brother, lowered into the
shaft by their parents. Tours are given daily during summer.</p>
<p>From Spring Valley, head south to Elmwood on Wisconsin 128, then east on
Wisconsin 72 to Downsville. From there it's only four miles south along
the Red Cedar River to the Caddie Woodlawn Home and Park, setting for
the 1935 children's classic &quot;Caddie Woodlawn.&quot;</p>
<p>Caroline Woodhouse, known as Caddie, is less-known than Laura Ingalls
Wilder, but her adventures were much more interesting. During her
childhood in the 1860s, she often ran off to gather hazelnuts in the
woods, dodge rattlesnakes and ford the river on tiptoe, to visit her
Santee Dakota friends.</p>
<p>The house and park are open daily, and there's no admission fee.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/caddie-woodlawn/">The first American
Girl</a> and
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/western-wisconsin-kids/">In Caddie and Laura's back
yard</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/elroy_sparta_bicyclists_spring.jpg" alt="Bicyclists pedal on Wisconsin's Elroy-Sparta State Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/vernon-county-wisconsin/">Vernon County</a></h3>
<p>The ridges and valleys of this picturesque county are a paradise for
children. The crooked Kickapoo River is a kick to canoe, and the
Elroy-Sparta State Trail is just over the border, famous for its three
dark and dank tunnels.</p>
<p>Mostly, Vernon County is a place to explore, on the trails of Wildcat
Mountain State Park, in a countryside sprinkled with 12 round barns and
at Amish farms, where children are fascinated by the electronics-free
lifestyle of Amish children.</p>
<p>Many Amish families sell pastries, plants, rugs, furniture and other
goods and welcome visitors every day except Sunday; Wisconsin 33 between
Ontario and Cashton is an especially good place to look.</p>
<p>Many cabins and cottages are for rent in pretty country locations.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_kayaker_peter.jpg" alt="Youth learns whitewater kayaking on Wolf River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Wolf River, a teen learns how to kayak in whitewater.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/whitewater-kayaking-101/">White Lake area</a></h3>
<p>The northeast corner of Wisconsin is a bubbling froth of rivers, a mecca
for whitewater kayakers.</p>
<p>This is the place to take a teen-ager-it offers danger and thrills,
but in a safe and structured environment. Near White Lake, Bear Paw
Outdoor Adventure offers cabins and campsites and rents boats.</p>
<p>Nearby, many outfitters offer rafting and tubing day trips on the Wolf,
Peshtigo and Menominee rivers, including <a href="http://www.shotguneddy.com/ShotgunEddy/Welcome.html">Shotgun
Eddy</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/quiet-wisconsin-dells/">Wisconsin Dells</a></h3>
<p>It's big, it's flashy, it's practically a Midwestern Las Vegas. But
fun is guaranteed, as long as you don't mind spending some money.</p>
<p>The bigger resorts now have <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/dells-water-parks/">indoor and outdoor water
parks</a> and
draw tourists year-round. People of all ages love the slides and rides.</p>
<p>And don't forget what made the Dells famous: the sandstone formations
along the Wisconsin River, as beautiful as when <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/bennett-studio-wisconsin-dells/">H.H. Bennett's
photos</a>
turned the area into a tourism destination in 1870s.</p>
<p>See them on excursions via launch, the amphibious Ducks or canoe. And
teen-agers like the jet-boat excursions.</p>
<p>For more about indoor water parks around the region, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/midwest-water-parks/">Water, water,
everywhere</a>.</p>
