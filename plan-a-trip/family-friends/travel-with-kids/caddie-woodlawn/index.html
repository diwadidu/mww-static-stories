<p>More than a decade before Laura Ingalls played on the banks of Plum
Creek, and 70 years before the fictional Kit Kittredge solved mysteries
in Ohio, a girl named Caroline &quot;Caddie&quot; Woodhouse roamed the
Wisconsin wilderness.</p>
<p>To many readers, Caddie was the first and best American Girl.</p>
<p>She came of age during the Civil War and loved the outdoors, gathering
hazelnuts in the woods, dodging rattlesnakes on the bluff and poling a
log raft on the lake.</p>
<p>She was friends with the local Indians, unlike Laura, who wanted her dog
to kill the ones who visited when the family was squatting on Osage land
in Kansas.</p>
<p>A Santee Dakota band lived near Caddie, who lived only half an hour
north of where Laura would be born, and she often forded the river on
tiptoe to watch them make birchbark canoes.</p>
<p>When she overheard settlers making plans to attack, the 11-year-old girl
got on a horse and rode over at dusk to warn them.</p>
<p>Caddie had pluck and a loyal heart. What she didn't have was a TV
series or a  Hollywood movie.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But her stories, relayed by her granddaughter in the 1935
Newbery-winning children's classic &quot;Caddie Woodlawn,&quot; still fires
the imaginations of young readers.</p>
<p>Many of them come to visit her childhood haunts south of Menomonie,
where two state bicycle trails meet near the confluence of the Red Cedar
and Chippewa rivers.</p>
<p>Her 1856 home still stands in Caddie Woodlawn Historical Park on
Wisconsin 25. It's a palace, if you're expecting the dugouts and
shanties of Laura Ingalls Wilder's childhood.</p>
<p>The stairs to the attic, where Caddie learned how to mend clocks, are
closed now, but visitors can walk onto the back porch, where she and her
six siblings churned butter.</p>
<p>Caddie's father John was a skilled millwright when the countryside
around Menomonie was being logged by Knapp, Stout Co., which became the
largest lumbering company in the world.</p>
<p>In Downsville, a restaurant occupies the 1857 Knapp, Stout company
store, established the year the Woodhouse family arrived from Boston.</p>
<p>Caddie's stomping grounds to the south is farmland now but still with
an untamed face, due to the rolling topography and the path cut by the
Red Cedar River, once the Menomonie.</p>

Caddie's Wisconsin house is unfurnished and can be visited any time.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's not hard to imagine the 1860s. The first time I visited Caddie's
house with my young daughter, Madeleine immediately caught her
heroine's spirit.</p>
<p>Tearing around the grounds, and venturing a few steps into the woods
behind the house, she found a white feather and came back brandishing
it, shouting, &quot;This is the secret treasure of Caddie Woodlawn! Think it
is?&quot;</p>
<p>A few years later, we visited again, and several boys of Asian heritage
were among the other visitors.</p>
<p>It reminded my daughter of a scene in a book that still chokes me up:
After witnessing the tearful farewell of a Dakota mother, sent away by a
white husband who became ashamed of her, Caddie spends a precious silver
dollar on candy, tops, combs and handkerchiefs to comfort three bereft
little boys.</p>
<p>&quot;Look, it's the Hankinson boys,&quot; Madeleine whispered.</p>
<p>Lois Schultz, who gives tours of Caddie Woodlawn Historical Park for the
Dunn County Historical Society, says boys like the book, too, since
Caddie's brothers Tom and Warren are along on many adventures in
&quot;Caddie&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Magical Melons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Caddie's father let her run wild, which was unusual,&quot; she says.
&quot;He was an unusual man. He was born in England and probably had never
seen an Indian, but he was friendly to them and felt they should have a
chance.&quot;</p>
<p>Her mother was a proper Bostonian who despaired of her tomboy daughter,
but when a letter comes from England offering a title and a big house
with peacocks, Harriet votes to stay in the frame house on 160 acres.
She's surprised to realize she loves it, too.</p>
<p>Today, bicyclists, paddlers, fishermen and turkey hunters traverse
Caddie country, which includes Dunnville Wildlife Area. When we went, we
followed a map of the area as it was in 1864, drawn by historian John
Russell.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Driving down County Road Y, we could see the wooded ridge that Caddie
and her brothers and sisters skirted on the way to school, run only in
winter and summer because the Dunnville kids had to share a teacher with
the kids in Durand.</p>
<p>Caddie's school isn't there, but there's the 1908 brick schoolhouse
that replaced it, now a private residence.</p>
<p>We saw Chimney Bluff, where Caddie braved rattlesnakes while picking
blueberries, and the shallow river. &quot;Don't you ever try to walk across
a river,&quot; I told  Madeleine, thinking of the many times Caddie, who
couldn't swim, crossed the river with her clothes on her head.</p>
<p>We saw the old ferry landing, where a trestle bridge now crosses the Red
Cedar. Crossing, we walked up the shaded bicycle trail for a stretch,
thinking of the steamer that docked here, bringing mail, supplies and
news of the Civil War to the Woodhouses, who could hear its whistle from
their farm.</p>
<p>Two years after the year chronicled in &quot;Caddie Woodlawn,&quot; the
steamer took Caddie and her family south to St. Louis. Caddie ended up
in Idaho and lived to be nearly  86. She was a wonderful storyteller,
inspiring her granddaughter and namesake, Carol Ryrie Brink, who lived
with her from the age of 8.</p>
<p>&quot;When Caddie got together with her sister Hetty, all they talked about
was living in Dunnville,&quot; Lois Schultz says. &quot;She was so happy here.
Carol Brink never got tired of hearing the stories, and her kids told
her to put them in a book.&quot;</p>
<p>As a character, little Laura Ingalls became more famous, in part because
of Michael Landon and the TV series &quot;Little House on the Prairie.&quot;</p>
<p>As a $90 doll and star of the Hollywood movie &quot;Kit Kittredge: An
American Girl,&quot; the fictional Kit also is more famous. Like Laura,
she was born in Wisconsin, protege of the American Girl corporation of
Middleton, a Madison suburb.</p>
<p>But Caddie, the girl with the heart as big as the outdoors she loved,
still resonates with readers.</p>
<p>&quot;People come in and they love, love Caddie Woodlawn,&quot; says Julie
Fuelling of the Red Balloon Bookshop in St. Paul. &quot;There's definitely
a following out there.&quot;</p>
