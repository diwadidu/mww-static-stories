<p>In Duluth, you can lead a child to water — but just try leading her
away.</p>
<p>&quot;Mom, it'd be worth moving to Duluth just so we could go to this beach a
lot,&quot; said my daughter Madeleine, jumping from rock to rock at Brighton
Beach at Kitchi Gammi Park.</p>
<p>Duluth is one of the best places in Minnesota to take children. On Canal
Park, the lineup of tourist attractions can keep a family entertained
for days.</p>
<p>There's the Great Lakes Aquarium, a skating and bicycle path, a
playground, a giant ore boat to tour and freighters to watch going under
the Aerial Lift Bridge.</p>
<p>There are tour boats to ride around the harbor and, nearby, a railroad
depot with trains to ride along the lake.</p>
<p>As parents discover, Duluth rocks for other reasons, too.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From the tip of Park Point to Brighton Beach, on the edge of town,
Duluth's <em>waterfront</em> is lined by endlessly entertaining rocks — rocks
to climb on, to skip in the lake, to hunt through for agates and
fossils.</p>
<p>Their pull is magnetic: No matter what else we did, soon I heard, &quot;Let's
go climb on the rocks.&quot;</p>
<p>Our first stop was the <em>Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center,</em> where
we saw the Canadian freighter Laurentien slipping out of the canal.</p>
<p>The sonorous horns, the clanging bells on the lifting bridge, the
screech of gulls and the lapping of waves create an air of excitement on
Canal Park that makes it hard to leave.</p>
<p>Still, we drove over the bridge onto Park Point, leaving the car at the
airport to walk along the <em>Park Point Trail,</em>  where Madeleine and Peter
&quot;snowboarded&quot; down a sand dune on their feet and played on a beach
covered with bleached driftwood.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_park_point_beach_kid.jpg" alt="A boy plays in the sand on Park Point." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On a warm day in August, a boy plays on the beach at Park Point
Recreation Area.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Then we headed over to the depot to catch the North Shore Scenic
Railroad's <em>Pizza Train.</em>  In a 1950s Budd Car, which has a built-in
engine, we trundled along the Lakewalk, earning smiles and waves from
walkers.</p>
<p>At the edge of town, we stopped to take on hot pepperoni and sausage
pizzas, delivered to us in our seats with cold cans of pop.</p>
<p>After the train turned around in Knife River, we went to the front and
watched for deer with two little girls, whom the engineer urged to help
blow the whistle every time a &quot;W&quot; sign popped up before intersections.</p>
<p>We thought we'd missed the nightly <em>s'mores roast</em> on the Inn on Lake
Superior's lakefront patio, but there were still plenty of Hershey bars
and marshmallows when we got back.</p>
<p>The next morning, Madeleine borrowed a sturdy bike and, with me and
Peter on in-line skates, set off along the eight-mile <strong>Lakewalk.</strong></p>
<p>There were lots of pebble beaches, but the kids waited until we got back
to Canal Park's jagged basalt boulders to play mountaineer and chase
ladybugs.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Next, we walked over the Minnesota Slip Bridge to the <em>Great Lakes
Aquarium.</em>  There was a lot to see: the scowling trout in the Baptism
River habitat, the giant sturgeon in the Isle Royale habitat, which
Madeleine thought were sharks — &quot;No? Oh, well, they're cool
anyway&quot; — and the river otters: &quot;If you think Peter is hyper, watch
these guys.&quot;</p>
<p>At the Isle Royale tank, we watched divers hand-feed the slow-moving
bottom-feeders. As the quicker trout tried to intercept the food, the
sturgeons' mouths popped out like nozzles, sucking it down to the teeth
in their throats.</p>
<p>After holding some crayfish and creating a miniature sandstorm, we
walked back to the lakefront and had lunch at <em>Dewitt-Seitz Marketplace.</em></p>
<p>We bought sweets at Hepzibah's candy store, whose wares made Peter so
excited that he offered to buy the shop for $8 million.</p>
<p>We only had time to do one more thing, so the kids decided they wanted
to head back to <em>Brighton Beach</em> to play on the rocks.</p>

<p>There was an astonishing amount of sibling agreement on our trip —
basically, they liked everything. It could be that Duluth is a parent's
kind of town, too.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Duluth with kids</h3>
<p><em>Where to stay and eat.</em> Reserve early for summer weekends at Canal
Park hotels. In winter and spring, check for deals.</p>
<p>For details on planning a visit, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/best-duluth-minnesota/">Duluth
101</a>.</p>
<p>You'll need to plan ahead in summer, when hotels fill up for nearly
every weekend. Don't even try to get a room for <a href="http://www.grandmasmarathon.com/">Grandma's
Marathon</a> weekend in mid-June.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.glaquarium.org/">Great Lakes Aquarium</a>: It's open daily.
Admission is $18 adults and $15 for children 3-17.</p>
<p><strong>Train excursions</strong>: The 2½-hour Music &amp;
Pizza Train of the <a href="https://duluthtrains.com/">North Shore Scenic
Railroad</a> goes to the Sucker River, halfway
to Two Harbors; reservations required. It's $28, $18 for children
3-13.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Thomas the Tank Engine appears at <a href="http://thomasthetrain.net/index.php/pages/north-shore-scenic-railroad.html">Day Out With
Thomas</a> over two weekends in August.</p>
<p>The railroad also offers many other excursions.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.lsmrr.org/">Lake Superior &amp; Mississippi Railroad</a>, run
by train-buff volunteers, travels along the St. Louis River for
90-minute, 12-mile round-trip tours at 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. on
weekends.</p>
<p>It leaves from the Waabizheshikana/Western Waterfront Trail parking lot
at Grand Avenue and 71st Avenue West, across from the Lake Superior
Zoo. It's closed due to Superfund clean-up but expects to reopen in 2023.</p>
<p>For more about the west Duluth and St. Louis Bay, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/water-sports/duluth-st-louis-river/">Duluth's other
waterfront</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Playgrounds</strong>: Playfront Park at
<a href="https://duluthmn.gov/parks/parks-listing/bayfront-festival-park-playfront-park/">Bayfront Festival
Park</a>
is Duluth's largest playground. The Bayfront Family Center lends out
rec equipment — frisbee golf, kites, volleyball sets, kickballs,
croquet sets — Monday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Lester Park also has an attractive playground.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_kids_seagulls.jpg" alt="Kids talk to gulls on Duluth's Canal Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Beaches</em>: Brighton Beach, or Kitchi Gammi Park, is at the end of the Lakewalk on the east edge of
Duluth, just past the Lester River. It's a great place to picnic, look
for agates and sunbathe. It's lined with slippery rocks, not sand, so
few people swim.</p>
<p>There are good swimming holes in the Lester River in Lester Park and in
Amity Creek along Seven Bridges Road. Or cross the Aerial Lift Bridge
and drive to the Park Point Recreation Area, which starts at 43rd Street
and has a beach house with restrooms.</p>
<p><em>Boat watching</em>: The free <a href="http://www.lsmma.com">Lake Superior Maritime Visitor
Center</a> gives daily programs and pier history
walks in summer. For boat arrival and departure times, check <a href="https://www.duluthboatforecast.org/">Duluth Boat Forecast</a>.</p>
