<h2>In western Wisconsin, a loop tour explores the homeland of two real-life heroines.</h2>

<p>When I was a child, I had a wild imagination. Anything would fire it up,
especially tales of exploration: in dank, twisting caves; along rushing
creeks shadowed by stone bluffs; on sun-kissed hilltops, with the world
stretching out all around.</p>
<p>And I loved the tales told by two real-life children's-book heroines:
the resourceful tomboy Caddie Woodlawn, who roamed the wilderness of
western Wisconsin during the Civil War, and Laura Ingalls Wilder, who
relished life in the Big Woods above Lake Pepin before they became
farmland.</p>
<p>Western Wisconsin, it seems, has fired many young imaginations. One
September, I took my own two children there, on a 185-mile tour with six
spots that appeal particularly to kids.</p>
<p>We started just outside Spring Valley at Crystal Cave, discovered in
1881 by a boy chasing a squirrel.</p>
<p>When it disappeared into the ground, he poked around with a stick and
found a hole. The next day, his parents lowered him and his brother into
it, along what now is called &quot;the slide.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Would any of you have sent your boys down here?&quot; asked our bubbly
young guide, April. &quot;Better not have,&quot; muttered my son Peter.</p>
<p>But he loved the cave and its fanciful formations of Popeye, Casper the
friendly cave ghost, Caveman Charlie and, according to Peter, a dragon's
head.</p>
<p>He liked the two bats we found sleeping near the ballroom, but was more
impressed by fossils of 435 million-year-old sea creatures: crinoids,
which look exactly like Spaghetti-Os, and centipede-like trilobites.</p>
<p>In the wish room, we each pressed a nickel into walls gleaming with
coins. &quot;I wished for a camera,&quot; Peter said.</p>
<p>We bought a picnic lunch at the grocery store in Spring Valley and
followed County Road B and Wisconsin 128 through the picturesque Eau
Galle River valley to Elmwood.</p>
<p>From there, we took Wisconsin 72 east to Downsville, and 25 south to the
Caddie Woodlawn Home and Park.</p>
<h3>Visiting Caddie Woodlawn</h3>
<p>In the early 1860s, a red-haired girl named Caroline Woodhouse lived
here, in a cottage that still stands.</p>
<p>She was the daughter of a millwright and a proper Boston mother, whom
she drove to distraction by running off to visit her Santee Dakota
friends, by braving the rattlesnakes of Chimney Bluff to pick
blueberries and by playing pranks of all kinds.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/e/pepin_laura_cabin.jpg" alt="A re-creation of Laura's Pepin house." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But mostly, Caddie had a heart as big as the outdoors she loved.</p>
<p>In 1935's Newbery-winning children's classic &quot;Caddie Woodlawn,&quot;
written by her granddaughter, Caddie spends a precious silver dollar to
buy candy, tops, combs and handkerchiefs for three bereft little boys
whose Dakota mother has just been sent away by their white father.</p>
<p>It's a scene that chokes me up even today and, apparently, was just as
vivid to my daughter, Madeleine.</p>
<p>&quot;Look, it's the Hankinson boys,&quot; she whispered, as several boys of
Asian heritage ran up to Caddie's house.</p>
<p>After exploring the house, we ate our lunch at one of the park's picnic
tables. Then we drove on down Wisconsin 25 to the Eau Galle Cheese
Factory. It was Sunday, and the cheesemakers weren't working, but we
sampled half a dozen kinds of cheese and ordered ice-cream cones.</p>
<p>A mile further, we turned west on U.S. 10 toward the town of Arkansaw,
where we stumbled on an enchanting little park along a creek.</p>
<p>It was squeezed between a sheer limestone bluff and a rock face beneath
County Road N and crossed by a Z-shaped wooden bridge.</p>
<p>It even had a time capsule inside a pyramid of mortared rocks, &quot;to be
opened in 2029.&quot; The children loved it.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's go fossil-hunting,&quot; shouted Peter, before he and Madeleine
shucked off their shoes and went wading in Arkansaw Creek.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I couldn't persuade them to leave until after they'd played on an
old-fashioned merry-go-round. Then we headed south on N and west on SS,
a roller-coaster, until we hit County Road CC.</p>
<p>That led south to the Little House Wayside, a re-creation of the log
house on the spot where the famous author lived for two years after her
birth in 1867 and for another two years after her family's brief stint
in Kansas.</p>
<h3>Just a replica</h3>
<p>But the cabin, surrounded by fields of clover, soybeans and corn, left
Madeleine cold.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just not that interesting to me, &quot; she said. &quot;I think, 'Wait a
minute, this isn't where Laura and Mary were born. It's not their cabin.
It's just <em>like</em> it.' &quot;</p>
<p>I thought about Pa Ingalls as we followed CC back north to H and
Wisconsin 35 in Maiden Rock, then north again on A along the Rush
River.</p>
<p>Pa, who yearned to get away from people, moved his family seven times in
10 years and ended up with nothing in a town on the South Dakota
prairie.</p>
<p>Yet this land he forsook is one of the most beautiful and least citified
pockets of the Midwest, and the bluffland is as wild as it's always
been.</p>
<p>&quot;That looks like the hill where Davy Crockett and his men were when the
Indians attacked,&quot; Madeleine remarked as we descended to the river.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/maiden_rock_rush_river.jpg" alt="Children pick berries at Rush River Produce." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On a ridge above Maiden Rock, children pick blueberries at Rush River
Produce.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Three miles above Maiden Rock, we found Terry Cuddy, who was a little
wiser than Pa. She and her husband, John, founded Rush River Produce in
1987 on a hill with a sweeping view of the river valley. Now they grow
gooseberries, currants and blueberries.</p>
<h3>Hunting and gathering</h3>
<p>&quot;It'll be berry hunting, not picking,&quot; Cuddy said cheerfully, as she
led us to the least-picked-over rows. &quot;So have fun, enjoy, and eat as
many as you want. It's all part of the experience.&quot;</p>
<p>Soon both children were intently hunched over the bushes, along with a
buzzing symphony of insects far too busy to bother with them. It seemed
to activate Peter's hunter-gatherer instincts. &quot;Can we come back
tomorrow?&quot; he asked. &quot;The day after tomorrow?&quot;</p>
<p>We drove down into the pink sunset over Lake Pepin and got home long
after dark. I tucked them into bed, Madeleine to dream of a rushing
creek and Peter of a blueberry patch in the hills.</p>
<p>We'd been gone 11 hours, and never once had I heard the dreaded &quot;B&quot;
word. In Caddie and Laura's back yard, boredom is the furthest thing
from a child's mind.</p>
