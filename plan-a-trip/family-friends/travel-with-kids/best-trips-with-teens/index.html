<h2>Sure, they'd rather be with their friends. But you're the one with the wallet.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_kayaker_peter.jpg" alt="Youth learns whitewater kayaking on Wolf River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Wisconsin's Wolf River, a teen kayaker paddles over rapids.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>By the time children turn 10, the day already is looming when they no
longer want to spend time with you, their loving parent.</p>
<p>Jeremy Southworth of La Crosse, Wis., saw that day coming. So when his
son Gavin got older, he took him jet-boating in the Dells and zip-lining
in Door County.</p>
<p>&quot;He'd been wanting to try zip-lining, so as soon as we came up here,
we decided, 'We're doing that,' &quot; he said.</p>
<p>Luckily, parents still are in demand when they're willing to pay for
thrills.</p>
<p>The riskier, the bette-though you can make sure no one gets hurt.
When I took my 14-year-old son whitewater kayaking, the first thing he
did was capsize and bash his head against a rock. But he was wearing a
helmet designed for that, and an instructor was nearby.</p>
<p>My son's Montessori teacher, who drove her parents crazy when she was a
teen, had a theory. Teens <em>need</em> to take risks, she says, and they also
need to burn off a lot of energy.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>For her, one of Outward Bound's <a href="https://www.outwardbound.org/classic/high-school-expeditions/">wilderness trips for
teens</a>
<a href="http://www.outwardbound.org/teens-outdoor-camp/?gclid=CMOq1qjgua8CFQda7AodSVmHmQ"></a>
would have been perfect. Those are pricey, though.</p>
<p>You don't need to be a Daddy Bigbucks or Mama Moneybags to get your
teens to enjoy a vacation with you.</p>
<p>In addition to thrills, they prize independence, which you can give them
on a fund-raising bicycle tour or at a family-friendly music festival
(the ones without alcohol).</p>
<p>Here are 10 ideas for fun things to do with teens on vacation.</p>
<h3>Whitewater kayaking and rafting</h3>
<p>When my son was 14, we headed deep into northeast Wisconsin's Nicolet
National Forest to learn
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/whitewater-kayaking-101/">whitewater-kayaking</a>
at Bear Paw Outdoor Adventure Resort.</p>
<p>He thought it was a lot like snowboarding, with face plants into water
instead of snow.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like catching air, except you don't get any air,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm
just grinding and trying stuff out. It's fun.&quot;</p>
<p>Bear Paw offers rentals and a list of local instructors. There's also
great whitewater rafting nearby. Outfitters include <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HerbsRafts/">Herb's Wolf River
Rafts</a> and <a href="http://www.shotguneddy.com/ShotgunEddy/Welcome.html">Shotgun
Eddy</a> on the Wolf
and <a href="https://www.kosirs.com/">Kosir's</a> on the Peshtigo.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_alpine_slide.jpg" alt="Riding the Alpine Slide on Lutsen Mountains." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Lutsen Mountains, one ride down the alpine slide is not enough.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Alpine slides</h3>
<p>In summer, some ski areas operate luge-style rides. At <a href="http://www.lutsen.com/summer/sawtooth_park/alpineSlide.cfm">Lutsen
Mountains</a>
on Minnesota's North Shore, it's a pair of twisting concrete chutes
with banked sides, and people run them in plastic sleds with hand
brakes.</p>
<p>It's especially fun for teens (and everyone else) because they can race
friends or family, and they can go as fast as they dare.</p>
<p>There are also alpine slides at <a href="https://www.chestnutmtn.com/">Chestnut
Mountain</a> near Galena, Ill., and <a href="http://www.crystalmountain.com/activities/alpine-slide">Crystal
Mountain</a> near
Michigan's Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore (where teens like to
do the Dune Climb).</p>
<p>In Duluth, <a href="https://www.spiritmt.com/adventure-park/">Spirit Mountain</a>
has an alpine coaster in its Adventure Park.</p>
<h3>Zip lines</h3>
<p>Zip lines have a high cool quotient, though they're not all created
equal.</p>
<p>Some are quite short. Some aren't in the tree canopy or a scenic
place.</p>
<p>We're guessing that teens would most enjoy racing friends or family on
dueling zip lines, which you can find near Lake Michigan at the ski
resorts <a href="https://www.boynehighlands.com/activities/zipline-adventures">Boyne
Highlands</a>
near Harbor Springs, Mich., and <a href="https://www.boynemountain.com/summer-activities/summer-zipline-adventure">Boyne
Mountain</a>
near Charlevoix. Their courses also are among the longest in the region.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>One of the longest indoor zip lines in North America is the  Barnacle
Blast over <a href="https://nickelodeonuniverse.com/home/">Nickelodeon Universe</a>
in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn. It's part of the
<a href="http://nickelodeonuniverse.com/rides/dutchmans-deck-adventure-course/">Dutchman's Deck Adventure
Course</a>, which includes a high-ropes course and slides.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/zip-lines-midwest/">A zeal for zip lines</a>.</p>
<h3>Ropes courses</h3>
<p>Many environmental centers have treetop ropes challenges.</p>
<p>One of the most scenic is at <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/environmental-center/eagle-bluff-ELC/">Eagle Bluff Environmental
Center</a> near the
southeast Minnesota town of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Lanesboro</a>. People get into harnesses and cross a series of cables, logs and
planks that are three stories high.</p>
<p>Some stretches are scarier than others-such as the Cherry Picker,
where there's nothing to hold onto except the knotted ends of ropes
above your head.</p>
<p>The reward is a zip line ride back to the ground, and relief-you did
it.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanesboro_cherry_picker.jpg" alt="The high ropes course at Eagle Bluff." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Cherry Picker is the scariest stretch of Eagle Bluff's ropes
course.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;It was certainly different from what I expected,&quot; said my daughter
after she finished it. &quot;But now I have something to brag about.&quot;</p>
<p>During the summer, Eagle Bluff's <a href="http://www.eagle-bluff.org/top/events/">ropes
course</a> is open to the public
most Saturdays and Tuesdays; register in advance. There's also a
Haunted Ropes Course in October.</p>
<p>On Minnesota's North Shore, the <a href="https://northshoreadventurepark.com/">North Shore Adventure
Park</a> in Silver Bay is built in a
wooded area around a cliff and has six ropes courses with four
difficulty levels and 10 zip lines.</p>
<p>To ramp up the thrill, it occasionally offers a Glow in the Park night
climb. Reserve in advance to get a discount and guaranteed start time.</p>
<h3>Jet boating</h3>
<p>The best-known teen attractions in the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/quiet-wisconsin-dells/">Wisconsin
Dells</a> are
the <a href="http://www.wisdells.com/wisconsin-dells-water-parks/outdoor.htm">water
parks</a>, whose rides get bigger and badder every year.</p>
<p>Teens also like high-speed, high-decibel jet-boat rides on the Wisconsin
River, powered by 1,200-horsepower engines. Of course, everyone is
soaked by the end.</p>
<p>Two companies offer the rides, <a href="http://www.jetboatadv.com/">Jet Boat
Adventures</a> and <a href="http://www.dellsducks.com/wildthing.html">WildThing Jet Boat
Tours</a>.</p>
<h3>Mountain biking</h3>
<p>This sport has everything teens like, including speed and danger.</p>
<p>Anyone can rent a mountain bike and try out a trail, but it helps to
have some instruction, such as &quot;If you don't want to run into it,
don't look at it,&quot; or, &quot;Keep your eyes on the trail, not on the
trees.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/e/kettle_moraine_biking.jpg" alt="Biking on the John Muir Trails." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The John Muir trails in Wisconsin's Kettle Moraine State
Forest-Southern Unit has a course where beginners can practice trail
skills.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Minnesota state parks have added <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/can_mountain_bike.html">I Can Mountain
Bike!</a> to
their list of beginner programs. Sessions are given on the popular
mountain-bike trails at <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/cuyuna_lakes/mtnbiking.html">Cuyuna Country State Recreation
Area</a>
in Ironton, east of Brainerd. They're for ages 10 and up.</p>
<p>Many parks have beginner loops, such as the popular <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/kms/trails.html">John Muir
trails</a> in Kettle
Moraine State Forest, near La Grange in southeast Wisconsin.</p>
<h3>Bicycle touring</h3>
<p>On a well-organized, family-friendly bicycle tour, parents can let their
teens ride ahead with their friends. In fact, some parents encourage it
-so the teens can get the tent set up by the time the parents roll
in.</p>
<p>My favorite is the MS Society's Ride Across Minnesota in late July,
which raises money to fight multiple sclerosis. Benefit rides tend to
attract a very nice group of folks, and they're also one of the
cheapest vacations a parent can take with a child, after the minimum
funds are raised.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Riders are treated to bountiful food at rest stops. For dinner, they can
buy food from various civic groups at the evening stop, usually a city
park or fairground, and there's also wholesome evening entertainment.</p>
<p>For more good tours, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/bicycle-tours-trips/">Sightseeing by
bicycle</a>.</p>
<h3>Music festivals with camping</h3>
<p>This is another place where teens can go off on their own and still be
near parents. Look for the ones that advertise children's activities
and don't sell alcohol.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best is the <a href="https://www.winnipegfolkfestival.ca/">Winnipeg Folk
Festival</a>, on the first long
weekend of July.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin's Kickapoo Valley, there's
<a href="https://www.kvama.org/">Larryfest</a> in August. In northwest Michigan
near Cross Village, <a href="http://www.blissfest.org/festival">Blissfest</a> is in
July.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, the <a href="http://www.riversongfestival.org/">RiverSong Music
Festival</a> on the Crow River in
Hutchinson is in July, and the <a href="http://www.minnesotabluegrass.org/">Minnesota Bluegrass &amp; Old-time Music
Festival</a> near St. Cloud is in
August.</p>
<p>But many festivals offer family camping. For more, check our list of
<a href="./events/midwest-music-festivals%3Fy=2020.html/">music festivals in
2021</a>.</p>
<h3>Lake resorts</h3>
<p>This is the best teen vacation of all, because they can go off on their
own and stay up as late as they want, usually hanging around with other
teens.</p>
<p>Small or medium-size family-run resorts are best, so teens can make
friends and can't go <em>too</em> far off on their own. Look for a resort that
has a lodge with a game room and, of course, WiFi.</p>
<p>Chances are your teens will like it so much they'll want to go every
year, even after they grow up and have teens of their own.</p>
