<p>As soon as we turned off the highway into Nisswa, my children's heads
began to swivel.</p>
<p>&quot;Souvenirs . . . Gift Shop . . . Moccasins,&quot; read my daughter
Madeleine. &quot;And look-Candy Store.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a cute town,&quot; said my son Peter, noticing the covered
sidewalks. &quot;It's like a cowboy town.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as we parked, Madeleine was pulling on my arm; she'd spied the
words &quot;Rainy Days Toy Store and Bookstore&quot; above one shop.</p>
<p>I first spent time in Nisswa when I rode into it on the Paul Bunyan
State Trail, which cuts through town on a corridor once used by logging
trains. It was Crazy Days, and throngs of shoppers prowled the
boardwalks.</p>
<p>Nisswa became a resort town after the loggers left, with the usual
souvenir and ice cream stores in the three-block downtown, 20 minutes
north of Brainerd.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But its complexion changed in the 1990s, with the opening of top-flight
golf courses nearby.</p>
<p>Now, people who can afford to spend $350 for a day's lodging and golf
at neighboring Grand View Lodge can come into town and spend even more
in the 50-plus boutiques.</p>
<p>But we were in town for an event started even before upscale was a word:
The Nisswa Turtle Races, held every Wednesday afternoon in summer since
1966.</p>
<p>First, we checked out the shops. When we walked into Zaiser's, heard
Pachelbel's Canon over the sound system and saw shelves of aromatherapy
wraps and soap by the slice, I started shaking my head over the
disappearance of good old-fashioned junk stores-until I heard an
excited cry, &quot;Look, Mom!&quot;</p>
<p>And there it was, a whole room full of sling shots, magic ink, lucky
rabbit's feet, arrowheads and exploding golf balls.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/nisswa_totem_pole.jpg" alt="Totem Pole in Nisswa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Totem Pole souvenir shop is a longtime kid favorite.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Everywhere we went, storeowners asked, &quot;Going to the turtle races?&quot;
After lunch, we headed for the parking lot behind the Chamber of
Commerce, where big circles were painted on the parking lot.</p>
<p>There was already a crowd, so we went to pick out turtles, a big one
that Peter named Charger and a medium one Madeleine called Tortoise.</p>
<p>I asked vendor Robert Litzau if it was true that bigger is better. He
smiled and put a finger to his lips.</p>
<p>&quot;Mum's the word,&quot; he said slyly. &quot;If I said so and they didn't win,
I'd be in hot water, wouldn't I?&quot;</p>
<p>As we waited for the races to begin, we talked with Clark Christiansen
and his son Sam, who had brought his own turtle; Christiansen was
attending his first race in Nisswa in three decades.</p>
<p>&quot;I was a turtle hunter as a child; all the local kids were,&quot; he said.
&quot;I had a whole stable, and we'd have tryouts in the yard.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The races haven't changed much, said Christiansen, though Nisswa has:
&quot;It used to be the real boondocks around here; we used to think we were
way out there,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, it's a strip all the way from
Minneapolis.&quot;</p>
<p>Then the first heats began, with children kneeling inside the first
circles, pounding the pavement and shouting their turtles on to victory.
Charger moved a respectable distance, but Tortoise just sat at the
starting line as Madeleine stared at him forlornly.</p>
<p>Finally, a 7-year-old from Iowa won the grand championship, earning $5
and his name on the radio, though he got to race again: After the main
race come races for button-holders, out-of-staters, resort guests and
&quot;mighty midgets.&quot;</p>
<p>That day, 229 turtles were entered, with more than 600 people looking
on.</p>
<p>&quot;It gets bigger and bigger every year,&quot; Litzau said when we returned
our turtles.</p>
<p>Then he relented and gave us a tip: &quot;Yeah, the bigger ones are
faster,&quot; he said, handing me a 40-year-old turtle the size of a
football. &quot;They've got a bigger stride. When they get going, they go.&quot;</p>
