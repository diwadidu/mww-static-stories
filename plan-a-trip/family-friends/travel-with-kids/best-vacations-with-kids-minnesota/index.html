<h2>There's a world of adventure awaiting families in the Land of Lakes.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grandmarais_rocks.jpg" alt="Kids play on the rocks in Grand Marais." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Children from Australia play on the rocks of Artists' Point in Grand
Marais.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>To children, the breakwall of Grand Marais' harbor is one big amusement
park.</p>
<p>I watched in fascination as a barefoot 3-year-old in diapers zoomed from
one jagged outcropping to another, scrambling up a chest-high cleft in
the rock to follow her 6-year-old sister along a lichen-covered ridge.</p>
<p>&quot;They climb anything and everything,&quot; their mother said, smiling.</p>
<p>Ian and Jill Jenkinson of Adelaide, Australia, had ventured south of the
border from Thunder Bay, where they spent a year on a teacher exchange.
Their 8-year-old son also was running full-bore along the rocky
shoreline.</p>
<p>&quot;Where we live, it's all sand, so these pebbles and rocks are
fascinating,&quot; Ian Jenkinson said. &quot;We've been to the Mall of America
and Disney World, places where they're excited to be, of course, but
realistically, I think they're having more fun here.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Children don't need a lot of bells and whistles to have a great time in
Minnesota. To them, the rocks of Grand Marais are better than any theme
park.</p>
<p>That's why Grand Marais is our No. 1 place to take children in
Minnesota. Not only does it have endless rock-skipping and rock-jumping
opportunities, but it's near two of our other Top 15 destinations, as
well as the re-created fur post at Grand Portage National Monument.</p>
<p>Here are some of the many great places to take kids in Minnesota.</p>
<p>For travel to the east, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/kids-in-wisconsin/">15 great places for kids in
Wisconsin</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boundary-waters-tips/">Boundary Waters</a></h3>
<p>Kids like to get away from the rat race, too — at least, that's what
my now-grown son tells me.</p>
<p>It's not so much that they love the paddling as the exploring they can
do once they get to their own private island or bay. This million-acre
expanse of lakes in northeast Minnesota is a big playground for kids,
who can swim whenever they feel like it, help build fires and watch for
loons and eagles.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/niagara_cave_kids.jpg" alt="Kids play outside Niagara Cave." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Niagara Cave near Harmony, children play around models of the pigs
who "discovered" it.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/minnesota-caves/">Cave country</a></h3>
<p>In southeast Minnesota, it was children who discovered Niagara Cave,
while looking for three pigs who'd fallen into a sinkhole.</p>
<p>A farmer lowered them down a rope, and 75 feet down, they found the pigs
and a labyrinth of underground canyons. Tours started in 1934, and three
years later, Mystery Cave was discovered nearby.</p>
<p>All kids love caves, where their imaginations turn stalagmites into
skeletal shinbones and columns into cave ghosts. There are also cool
fossils embedded in the damp walls and, at Mystery Cave, thousands of
bats.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/duluth-kids/">Duluth</a></h3>
<p>The port of this Lake Superior town, once was known for dives and
drunken sailors, now is one of the most popular family destinations in
Minnesota.</p>
<p>Families bent on sightseeing can take the Pizza Train to the Lester
River and back, visit the Great Lakes Aquarium and ride the Timber
Twister at Spirit Mountain.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>But the best things are free: watching freighters go under the Aerial
Lift Bridge, jumping on the rocks of Canal Park, biking along the
Lakewalk and playing in the sand dunes of Park Point.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/best-ely-minnesota-summer/">Ely</a></h3>
<p>It's got real wolves and real bears — pretty cool for a kid and
adults, too. The wolves are behind a wall of Plexiglas at the
International Wolf Center, where naturalists explain why only Little Red
Riding Hood needs to fear wolves.</p>
<p>There are programs throughout the day, and a special feeding program
Saturday.</p>
<p>Black bears can be seen in a wooded enclosure at the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/ely-bear-center/">North American
Bear Center</a>, where
staff tell visitors charming stories about their bear-sized
personalities.</p>
<p>Not far away, near Orr, children can see bears in the wild at the <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/orr-bear-sanctuary-minnesota/">Vince
Shute Wildlife
Sanctuary</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/itasca-park-tips/">Itasca State Park</a></h3>
<p>There's one thing every child in Minnesota and most other places, too,
wants to do: Walk across the Mississippi River. The only place it's easy
to do that is at the river's headwaters in Itasca State Park, where a
line of boulders marks the end of Lake Itasca and the beginning of the
Mississippi.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/i/t/itasca_headwaters_girl.jpg" alt="Kids at the Itasca headwaters." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Itasca State Park, kids run across the rocks that mark the start of
the Mississippi.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There's also a swimming beach, biking and hiking trails and a
paddlewheeler that gives tours of Itasca Lake, almost always sighting
bald eagles.</p>
<p>In summer, naturalists lead several hikes and nature programs a day.
It's a favorite park for families, many of whom have been going for
generations.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/grand-marais-minnesota-arts/">Grand Marais</a></h3>
<p>When he was 10, my son called the rocks along this harbor town's
breakwall and on Artists Point &quot;my idea of the perfect place to play.&quot;</p>
<p>Small kids run and jump among the rocky crevices, medium-size kids stack
flat stones into towering cairns and big kids ride mountain bikes along
the top of the raised concrete walking path.</p>
<p>The town's cobblestone beach is perhaps the best place in the state to
skip stones, and Good Harbor Bay, just west of town, is one of the best
to find Thomsonite and agates.</p>
<p>Downtown, there's a fudge shop, a pizza place and the World's Best Donut
Shop, with glazed doughnuts handed out hot from the fryer every morning.
What's not to love?</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/r/crow_wing_raft_jumpers.jpg" alt="Kids jump off the raft at a Minnesota lake resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
For children, a lake resort is the best possible vacation.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/choosing-lake-resort/">Lake resorts</a></h3>
<p>It should be every child's birthright to spend a week at a lake resort
every year, because there's nothing — nothing — they like better.</p>
<p>My kids have been going since they were born, and it's the one week of
the year they'd never give up, even though they're both adults now.</p>
<p>When they were little, they loved being on their own to run around, from
beach to playground to lodge to cabin. When they were older, they loved
reconnecting with once-a-year friends and taking off on the nearby bike
trail.</p>
<p>Nearly every lake resort has the basics — housekeeping cabins, a
beach, a small playground, docks from which kids can fish for crappies.</p>
<p>And most also have a lodge, with a game room and snack counter that
dispenses ice cream and candy. For kids, it's heaven.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/minneapolis-riverfront/">Minneapolis</a></h3>
<p>In this big town, no kid will be bored. Teens can see a play at the
Guthrie, ride the Flour Tower at Mill City Museum and go kayaking from
Lake of the Isles to Cedar Lake. Little kids can build sand castles on
family-oriented Lake Harriet.</p>
<p>Everyone can go for a bicycle ride around the Chain of Lakes, even
babies and toddlers, who can be strapped into a bike trailer.</p>
<p>And three main attractions are connected by the Blue Line light-rail
trains: Target Field, where the Twins play downtown; Minnehaha Park,
home of the famous waterfall; and the Mall of America, home of the 
Nickelodeon Universe amusement park.</p>
<h3>Lutsen</h3>
<p>Lutsen Mountains is a year-round destination for thrill-seeking kids and
teens. In the winter, they can ski and snowboard; in the summer, they
can go screaming down the concrete chutes of the <a href="https://www.lutsen.com/plan-your-trip/lodging-activities/activity-finder/alpine-slide">Alpine
Slide</a> and
ride the Mountain Tram to the chalet on top of Moose Mountain.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_alpine_slide.jpg" alt="Riding the Alpine Slide on Lutsen Mountains." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On Lutsen Mountains, one ride down the Alpine Slide never is enough.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Lutsen is the heart of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/">North
Shore</a>, a favorite of any kid who
likes to explore the outdoors. There are many <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/north-shore-lodgings/">places to
stay</a>, there and
nearby.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.mnhs.org/places/sites/nwcfp/index.htm">Pine City</a></h3>
<p>At the re-created Snake River Fur Post, formerly known as the North West
Company Fur Post, children go back 200 years to live like a voyageur,
many of them only 14 or 15 themselves when they were hired to paddle
canoes into the wilderness.</p>
<p>One of the favorite pastimes is cat and mouse, a simple but addictive
voyageur game in which two people crouch on stumps, each holding one end
of the rope, and try to yank each other off.</p>
<p>They dip candles, visit the Ojibwe village and watch cannon
demonstrations. If they look able, re-enactors may hand them wooden
muskets and lead them in a charge.</p>
<p>&quot;Present! Aim and fire! Bang! Reload! All right, recruits, you've all
served the king well,&quot; they say. &quot;Turn in your arms, and you can now
retire with honor and 100 acres of land.&quot;</p>
<p>No child can resist the colorful voyageurs, who sang saucy ditties, told
tall tales and — boasting being a favorite pastime — loved to see
who could paddle fastest, carry the heaviest pack and throw a hatchet
hardest.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pine_city_fur_post_kids.jpg" alt="Kids and voyageurs in Pine City." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Kids join voyageurs in a drill at the Snake River Fur Post in Pine City.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Children can join living-history interpreters and re-enactors at <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/fur-trade/">fur
trade sites</a> and
rendezvous around the state. At Grand Portage National Monument,
Rendezvous and Powwow is the second weekend of August.</p>
<p>The Snake River Fur Post's Fall Gathering is the third weekend of
September, and the Big Island Rendezvous in Albert Lea is the first
weekend of October.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/pipestone-quarries-minnesota/">Pipestone</a></h3>
<p>Minnesota's two national monuments are on opposite sides of the state
— Grand Portage near the Canadian border, and Pipestone National
Monument near South Dakota.</p>
<p>Plains Indians made pilgrimages to the famous pipestone quarries long
before the 1855 poem &quot;Song of Hiawatha&quot; turned them into a tourist
attraction.</p>
<p>They saw the work of the Great Spirit here, where seams of soft red
stone extracted from red and pink quartzite could be carved into
effigies and pipes called calumets, whose smoke carried messages to the
Great Spirit.</p>
<p>It's still a sacred place, and children can meet carvers, who still
work the quarries. A trail leads to Winnewissa Falls, Leaping Rock and
the Oracle.</p>
<p>If you visit, stop to see two other places nearby where red quartzite
pops out of the prairie sod, <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/jeffers-petroglyphs/">Jeffers
Petroglyphs</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/blue-mounds-minnesota/">Blue Mounds State
Park</a>, which
includes a herd of bison.</p>
<p>See all three places on a <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/pipestone-road-trip/">Road trip to Southwest
Minnesota</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/u/p/upper_sioux_wacipi_girls.jpg" alt="Girls dance at the Upper Sioux wacipi." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/powwows-wacipi-upper-midwest/">Powwows</a></h3>
<p>When you hear your kids ask if Indians still exist, it's high time to
take them to a powwow. Dakota and Ojibwe children have been going to
them since birth; it's a key part of their culture.</p>
<p>For other kids, it's a good way to learn about a culture that thrived
long before Europeans arrived. Everyone is welcome at a powwow; the
tradition of welcoming outsiders is an old one.</p>
<p>There are two kinds. Traditional powwows are less formal and more like
family reunions. Competition powwows are flashier, because dancers and
sometimes drummers vie for cash prizes.</p>
<p>Powwows, often called wacipi by the Dakota, are held in the warm months,
and especially on the long Memorial Day, Fourth of July and Labor Day
weekends. Don't miss the Grand Entry, usually held at 1 p.m. Saturday
and Sunday and 7 p.m. Saturday.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/st-paul-sightseeing/">St. Paul</a></h3>
<p>It's funny that St. Paul first was settled by and named for a tavern
owner, because today it's known as the friendlier, more wholesome half
of the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>Most of its attractions are aimed at children, and most are within a few
blocks of each other downtown.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/a/taylors_falls_franconia_stand.jpg" alt="The Lizard Lounge at Franconia Art Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Franconia Sculpture Park near Taylors Falls, the Lizard Lounge sells
snacks.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From Harriet Island, take a cruise up the Mississippi River on a
paddlewheeler. On the second weekend of August, the family-friendly
Irish Fair is in the park.</p>
<p>The Science Museum of Minnesota sits atop the river bluffs across from
Harriet Island. Two blocks away, Rice Park is home to the turreted stone
Landmark Center, which hosts many free heritage festivals.</p>
<p>Walk another two blocks to Mickey's Diner. On the next block is the
Minnesota Children's Museum, geared to children from 6 months to 10
years. That's near the  History Theatre, which stages many family
shows.</p>
<p>There's more history up the hill at the Minnesota History Center,
between the Cathedral of St. Paul and the Minnesota State Capitol.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/taylors-falls-minnesota/">Taylors Falls</a></h3>
<p>Kids who love rocks turn into mountain goats on the craggy cliffs of the
St. Croix River, where water from a melting glacier roared by with such
fury that whirlpools drilled cylindrical holes into solid rock —
potholes, the world's deepest.</p>
<p>In Interstate State Park, several of them created the Devil's Parlor,
and two created the Bake Oven. The Lily Pond, Hourglass and the 67-foot
Bottomless Pit are nearby, fun to visit both in summer and winter.</p>
<p>Don't worry too much about sure-footed older kids, but keep a close
grip on younger ones. In town, stop for lunch or a root-beer float at
the Drive-In Restaurant.</p>
<p>Kids can do more climbing and exploring at Franconia Sculpture Park,
three miles west of Taylors Falls at the junction of Minnesota 95 and
U.S. 8.</p>
<p>It offers Kids Make Sculpture workshops once a month in summer, and its
kid-friendly Arts &amp; Artists Celebration and Festival is the fourth
Saturday in September.</p>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ingalls-wilder/wilder-pageants/">Walnut Grove</a></h3>
<p>This farm town in southwest Minnesota, not far from Pipestone, has few
traces of its most famous residents but is best known of all the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ingalls-wilder/laura-ingalls-wilder-sites/">Laura
Ingalls Wilder
sites</a>, thanks to the 1974-82 TV series &quot;Little House on the Prairie.&quot;</p>
<p>There's just a church bell, a quilt and the site of a dugout to show
for the 3½ years Laura Ingalls lived in Walnut Grove with her family at
two separate times. Luckily, kids' imaginations fill in the gaps with
no problem.</p>
<p>There's an interesting museum, and visitors can drive to see the site
of the family's creekside dugout. The best time to visit is in July,
when the town puts on an outdoor pageant with many fun special effects.</p>
<p>Drive another two hours west to De Smet, S.D., and you can see another
pageant on the shores of Silver Lake. Tours include the Surveyor's
House, the Ingalls' borrowed first home, and Ma and Pa's frame home,
which Pa built in 1887.</p>
