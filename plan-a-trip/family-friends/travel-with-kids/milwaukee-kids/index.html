<h2>For children, this easygoing city is just the right size.</h2>

<p>There's one city in the Midwest that never will get too big for its
lederhosen.</p>
<p>Milwaukee, sometimes called the biggest small town in America, doesn't
brag — though it should. It has a swell baseball stadium, a beloved
art museum and a beautiful lakefront.</p>
<p>Lake Michigan borders downtown, lined with beaches, bike trails and
playing fields. Craft breweries and restaurants reflect a culture
steeped in <em>Gemütlichkeit,</em> the German
term for congeniality and good life.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, Milwaukee was the 11th-largest city in the nation, a
blue-collar behemoth. It's been shrinking ever since but still is the
state metropolis.</p>
<p>It doesn't exactly bustle, though — it's just a big, good-natured city
that thinks it's small, the Baby Huey of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Milwaukee is a good place to take small people. My son
Peter and I went there one April, to watch the Brewers play under the
retractable roof of Miller Park, now American Family Field, and to see
what else was going on.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We stayed at the downtown Hilton Milwaukee City Center, from which we
walked to the Old World Third Street Historic District, once the center
of German culture and society. The Milwaukee Bucks were playing nearby
at Fiserv Forum.</p>
<p>The next morning, we walked to the <em>Milwaukee Public Museum,</em> a block
from the Hilton.</p>
<p>The big museum has been a favorite of Wisconsin schoolchildren for
generations, especially for its &quot;Streets of Old Milwaukee,&quot; where
cobbled lanes pass a toy store filled with tin soldiers, a candy store
stocked with old-style sweets and a drugstore with a ventilated jar of
leeches sitting on the counter.</p>
<p>The skeleton of a humpback whale hangs over a muskrat display that, in
1890, was America's first habitat diorama. The museum still is renowned
for the realism of its displays and environments, such as its rain
forest.</p>
<p>Children love that as well as the dinosaur exhibits, especially one in
which a Tyrannosaurus Rex attacks a Triceratops.</p>

<p>&quot;Cool, look at the guts,&quot; Peter said. &quot;Let's see what he bit out.&quot;</p>
<p>The <em>butterfly wing,</em> a humid haven for butterflies from around the
world, also is hugely popular. For a while, we shadowed a volunteer
docent, who carried a fading red swallowtail on her shoulder and a Blue
Morpho sucking at an orange in her hand.</p>
<p>The fragile lepidoptera, she said, live only seven to 10 days.</p>
<p>&quot;Every night, we go through and pick up 25 or 30,&quot; she said. &quot;And in
the morning, we open the door of the chrysalis house and let the ones
whose wings have hardened fly out.&quot;</p>
<p>Visitors aren't allowed to grab at the butterflies, but they can try to
attract them by wearing denim, khaki and orange colors, we were told.
Sure enough, a Heliconia landed on my light-blue pen, allowing me to
lift it and examine its delicately curled proboscis.</p>
<p>Under the same roof, we saw an <em>IMAX show.</em> In the science center, we tried out an exhibit that was highly practical, like the city.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Labeled &quot;Milwaukee muscle — outsmarting gravity since 1835,&quot; it
allowed us to lift a 100-pound fieldstone with a lever, a 300-pound
block of ice with a windlass and Peter's 85 pounds with a pulley.</p>
<p>We also played with electricity and let sound waves measure our height,
but we didn't have time to dabble in the R &amp; D Cafe, where a &quot;chef&quot;
takes orders for experiments and delivers boxes full of polymers,
plastics and old appliances.</p>
<p>We tried to do it all justice, but eventually wore ourselves out. So we
walked toward the Milwaukee River and <em>Mader's,</em> one of the city's
oldest German restaurants.</p>
<p>Mid-afternoon turned out to be a good time to arrive: We got our own
room and lounged there, listening to classical
music, sipping drinks out of crystal glasses and ogling the
high-Teutonic decor.</p>
<p>Dishes on the lunch menu were a bargain, and the children's menu
included Wiener schnitzel, beef goulash, breaded pork chop and boiled
knackwurst.</p>
<p>From Mader's, we walked along the river to <em>Pere Marquette Park,</em> where
Peter climbed a birch tree, and then crossed to the <a href="https://www.safe-house.com/"><strong>Safe
House</strong></a>, a goofy spy-themed bar and
restaurant in alley-like Front Street.</p>

<p>He didn't really get the Mad magazine and 007 references posted
throughout the maze-like place, but he did like operating the swinging
bookcase through which patrons enter.</p>
<p>At 6 p.m., we caught a special city bus outside the Hilton, and it took
us straight down Wisconsin Avenue to the $399 million <em>American Family
Field,</em>  pride of Milwaukee. With its clock tower and
fan-shaped roof, it's handsome inside and out, an old-style ballpark.</p>
<p>It definitely delights the locals. When that night's attendance was
announced — 34,998, just 7,500 short of a sell-out — the crowd
roared.</p>
<p>&quot;On an April night at the old stadium, it'd be maybe 2,000 or 3,000,&quot;
said my neighbor, Diane Knight of Wauwatosa. &quot;It'd be just too chilly.&quot;</p>
<p>Knight was my interpreter for the evening, explaining the twisting
yellow chute that lederhosen-clad Bernie the Brewer slides down after
homers and the seventh-inning sausage race, run by an oversized brat, a
hot dog, a Polish, an Italian sausage and a chorizo.</p>
<p>&quot;Only in Milwaukee,&quot; she said fondly.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The high point of the game came after it was over. As the theme from
&quot;2001: Space Odyssey&quot; played, the crowd watched raptly as the roof
gracefully folded back over itself, to let in air and sun for the grass
field.</p>
<p>City buses were waiting to take us back downtown, where honking marked
the end of an Admirals hockey game.</p>
<p>In the morning we drove through downtown, past the stunningly ornate
1876 Mitchell Building and other old stone buildings.</p>
<p>As we turned onto the lakefront drive, Peter pointed and said, &quot;What's
that boat?&quot; It was the <em>Milwaukee Art Museum's</em>  $100 million
expansion, designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava with a
blindingly white &quot;wing&quot; that also resembles a sail with mast and
rigging.</p>
<p>It was a sunny day, so we pulled in at <em>North Point</em>  for a last stroll.
Peter made a beeline for the boulders strewn along the shore, jumping
from one to another. Then he discovered a piece of rock embedded with
dozens of fossils, which made him jump for joy.</p>
<p>&quot;I love Milwaukee!&quot; he shouted. &quot;I could climb on these rocks all day.
I want to stay in Milwaukee forever.&quot;</p>

Children like to watch the Milwaukee Art Museum's brise soleil open and
close.

<p>Seeing neighboring <em>Bradford Beach,</em>  with its gleaming white sand, made
him love it even more. &quot;We have our swimsuits — just for half an
hour?&quot; he pleaded.</p>
<p>But it was April, way too cold for swimming in a Great Lake. So Peter
had to leave Milwaukee to the boys of summer — on the beach, in the
ballpark and everywhere else in this kid-friendly city.</p>
