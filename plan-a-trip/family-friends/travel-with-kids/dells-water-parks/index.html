<h2>The ever-expanding indoor water parks in the Wisconsin Dells have so many rides and slides, it's hard to know which one to pick.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_indoor_waterpark_tubes.jpg" alt="Children ride tubes at an indoor water park in the Wisconsin" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Children ride the waves at Wilderness Resort's indoor water park in the
Wisconsin Dells.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>First, we loved the water slides, geysers and whimsical fiberglass
figures at the Polynesian's Water Factory.</p>
<p>Then, we loved the bigger slides, chutes, lily-pad walk and tubing river
at Great Wolf's Spirit Mountain.</p>
<p>When the Wilderness opened Klondike Kavern, its second park, we loved
its indoor-outdoor hot tub and long tube slides.</p>
<p>An arms race was only beginning, as Wisconsin Dells hotels expanded on a
good idea — fill rooms year-round by offering indoor water parks.</p>
<p>Great Wolf added a second park, with a gigantic bucket that dumps 700
gallons of water over a maze of chutes and ladders. The Kalahari opened
with everything the other parks had, plus a wave pool, funnel slide and
family raft ride.</p>
<p>After the Wilderness built a third park, with a wave pool, family raft
ride and giant bucket, the Kalahari added the Master Blaster roller
coaster and the FlowRider, for surfing and body-boarding.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The Great Wolf put in the Howlin' Tornado, a six-story raft ride that
features a steep drop into a funnel.</p>
<p>Then the Wilderness added the Wild WaterDome, which lets in sunlight for
year-round tanning, the Hurricane and Cannonbowl rides and dueling
racing-raft rides.</p>
<p>Great Wolf added Bear Track Landing, with eight new rides and a wave
pool.</p>
<p>The Kalahari added a 100,000-square-foot giant indoor theme park with a
six-story Ferris wheel and and elevated go cart course.</p>
<p>The Wilderness came back with a 3-D pirate-themed miniature golf course
and an ocean-themed, 3-D, black-light course with six aquariums
containing nurse sharks, moral eels and reef fish.</p>
<p>Today's water parks are vast caverns that supply more thrills than
anyone needs — but not more than anyone wants.</p>
<h3>Rafting at Great Wolf</h3>
<p>I made my last trip to check out the indoor water parks with my friend
Adele, who'd never been to the Dells at all.</p>
<p>Before we checked in to Great Wolf Lodge, I drove Adele along the
Wisconsin River, where sandstone cliffs and oddly shaped formations,
named from the French dalles, have been drawing sightseers since the
1850s.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/wisconsin_dells_great_wolf_lilypad.jpg" alt="Kids on the lilypad walk at Great Wolf." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Kids pull themselves along the lily-pad walk at Great Wolf Lodge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Once, <em>they</em> were the big deal (see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/quiet-wisconsin-dells/">The
quiet side of the
Dells</a>.</p>
<p>Then we drove down the Vegas-like strip, past the gigantic Trojan horse
and roller coasters of Mount Olympus and the full-scale, upside-down
model of the White House at Top Secret.</p>
<p>By the time we got to Great Wolf's lobby, where an entire moose perches
on the side of a three-story fieldstone fireplace, Adele had caught on
to the spirit of the Dells.</p>
<p>&quot;Everything has to be big, doesn't it?&quot; she said.</p>
<p>We started at the first of Great Wolf's three indoor water parks, which
was the largest in the nation when it opened in 1997. Adele was
impressed, but I thought, &quot;Is this all there was?&quot;</p>
<p>It seemed so ordinary, though once I'd been thrilled with the
20,000-square-foot park. I felt like the grasping woman in the Grimms'
tale &quot;The Fisherman and His Wife&quot; — no matter how much I get, I want
more.</p>
<p>We started on the Lookout Mountain slide, a smooth, open raft ride
that's still a winner. Adele bumped her head in one of the closed,
narrow body chutes, so we took a break in a hot tub, with a waterfall
that poured out of faux cliffs.</p>
<p>Then we walked over to the newer park, where we lugged a four-person
raft up 89 steps to the top of the Howlin' Tornado.</p>
<p>For Adele, going over a sheer drop backward was too much, too soon. But
she rallied and did it twice more before finding a torrent of water to
stand under, letting it massage her tense shoulders.</p>
<h3>'Surfing' at the Kalahari</h3>
<p>After dinner on the strip at Moosejaw Pizza &amp; Brewing Co., we drove to
the Kalahari and bought evening passes to the water park. Adele, who
lived in Hawaii for two years and loves to surf, was looking forward to
trying the FlowRider, inaugurated by surfer Bethany Hamilton.</p>
<p>But the FlowRider turned out to be a miniscule slope with ferocious
torrents of whitewater — shooting backward.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that it? I can't surf on that,&quot; she said, disappointed.</p>
<p>Nearly everyone tried to body-board instead, though they wiped out
nearly as soon as people who tried to surf — in about two seconds.
Once they flipped into the water, the jets hurled them to the top of the
slope and slammed them against the foam backboard.</p>
<p>&quot;We had the Great Lakes Surfing Association here, and they couldn't do
it,&quot; one of the instructors told us. &quot;It doesn't really translate.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/wisconsin_dells_great_wolf_kids.jpg" alt="Kids at the Great Wolf Lodge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We suffered the same fate body-boarding, though Adele stayed on for a
few seconds on her second try. So we retreated to the wave pool, where
we bobbed on swells that Adele thought had potential.</p>
<p>&quot;You could probably surf on this, though you'd wipe out a few children
on the way,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>From there, we tried the Rippling Rhino, a smooth raft ride that Adele
loved, and the Master Blaster, a water roller coaster that dipped,
dropped and pulled us up, down and around a long series of curves. Now
<em>that</em> was an absolute hoot.</p>
<p>The beauty of these water parks is they bring out the kid in everyone,
no matter what age. At the Kalahari, we met Mary VandeHei of Eden
Prairie, Minn., who had brought her family in from around the nation to
celebrate her birthday as well as her son's recent return from Iraq.</p>
<p>&quot;You know what? I'm 60, and I love those slides,&quot; she said. &quot;I adore
them; I'm nuts about them.&quot;</p>
<p>In the morning, back at Great Wolf, we lay in the sun on chaises and
watched children pull on fire hoses and swing on ropes.</p>
<h3>Riding waves at the Wilderness</h3>
<p>Then we went over to the Wilderness and its Wild West water park, which
has a wave pool lined with water guns on both sides and a play area
called Ransack Ridge, from which a giant mining cart dumps water every
seven minutes.</p>
<p>Adele thought it had the liveliest tubing river of the three, and we
both loved the indoor-outdoor hot tubs.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_kalahari.jpg" alt="Children play in a water park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Sitting outdoors in the winter sun, steam curling around our ears, we
asked Denise Gillespie, of Lakemoor, Ill., why there were so many
school-aged kids around on a weekday, including her own daughter and
son.</p>
<p>She said the parks are too crowded and expensive on weekends, so they
bring homework and come on weekdays.</p>
<p>&quot;This is their Valentine's Day present,&quot; she said. &quot;I look at their
grades, I look at the deals, and then we go.&quot;</p>
<p>Sometimes, she and her husband, John Hearst, bring his two daughters.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a good thing for families; there's something for everyone,&quot; she
said.</p>
<h3>Chilling at Chula Vista</h3>
<p>This resort, the only one that's not on a strip, is a late entrant in
the water-park wars. Its Lost Rios indoor park is compact but nicely
designed, with a Mayan temple theme.</p>
<p>It was busy when we were there on a Sunday in mid-October, but we
didn't have to wait to ride the Fly'n Mayan roller coaster, Emerald
Run tube slide or Matador mat-race slide, and only a few minutes for the
Jungle Adventure &quot;toilet bowl&quot; ride.</p>
<p>My friend Debra liked the Jungle Adventure — &quot;We went around so many
times I lost count,&quot; she said — but I got a kick out of the roller
coaster, even if it literally kicked me (try to keep your butt elevated
an inch or so).</p>
<p>Kids were loving the Matador, especially those who had learned to go
fast (limit contact points to your elbows and knees) and beat their
parents.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_wilderness_indoor.jpg" alt="An indoor water park at Wilderness Resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Wild West water park at the Wilderness includes 70,000 square feet
of slides and rides.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The Action River was a little poky and choked with empty tubes, but a
man pushing his wife made it fun for us, too, giving us big pushes and
holding us under a waterfall. We ran from ride to ride, doing
everything.</p>
<p>As I was toweling off, I talked with a woman who said she'd gone to the
Wilderness in March.</p>
<p>&quot;It was so crowded it wasn't even fun,&quot; she said. &quot;This was more
fun, even if the rides aren't as intense.&quot;</p>
<h3>Who's best?</h3>
<p>There's a lot to consider when choosing a Wisconsin Dells hotel and
water park. Denise Gillespie had booked at Great Wolf but switched to
the Wilderness when it sent her an &quot;awesome&quot; deal;  she says the
Kalahari is too expensive.</p>
<p>The Kalahari has many bells and whistles, and its African-safari decor,
in the water park and throughout the hotel, is very attractive. But it
attracts many conventioneers, and it was crowded even on a Wednesday
night.</p>
<p>On the other hand, that Master Blaster is a great ride, and there are
all kinds of activities for families.</p>
<p>Great Wolf is across the highway from the Kalahari, alongside I-94/90.
It's also very attractive, with north-woods decor, and its atmosphere is
less frantic than the Kalahari's.</p>
<p>For a Wednesday night, we reserved a double-queen room, and when we
checked in, we got a $10 coupon as a reward for reserving on-line; we
used it to buy a nice breakfast the next morning in the Loose Moose Bar
and Grill.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Of the three, the Wilderness consistently offers the best specials. It,
too, is very attractive, and its lodging complex has the most attractive
setting by far, alongside a ravine filled with white pines.</p>
<p>Its water parks — one is for smaller children — are not contiguous,
however, and it's a long hike from the Wild West park to Klondike
Kavern.</p>
<p>All three hotels have day spas and big indoor play areas in addition to
the water parks.</p>
<p>And then there's Mount Olympus, a cavernous water park with lots of
slides, and a dozen other hotels with smaller water parks, any one of
which would delight children who hadn't already gotten a look at the
flashier places.</p>
<p>Now, the Dells have competition. Water parks are popping up all over the
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/midwest-water-parks/">Upper Midwest</a> and around the nation.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb is, all water parks are fun. But if you want to see
how the pros do it, go to the Dells.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Indoor water parks in the Wisconsin Dells</h3>
<p><em>Getting there:</em> It's 45 minutes from Madison, 3½ hours from the Twin
Cities and 4 hours from Chicago.</p>
<p><em>When to go:</em> Weekend and holiday rates are highest. The lowest rates
disappear during spring break, mid-March through mid-April. If you go
then, expect crowds.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/wisconsin_dells_polynesian.jpg" alt="Water park at the Polynesian." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Children come down a slide at the Polynesian's Water Factory.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Try to go on weekdays, when rates are much cheaper and lines are
shorter. November and early December are the slowest months, and you'll
find the best deals then.</p>
<p><em>What to know:</em> Sometimes, hotels send deals to past guests and those
on its e-mail lists. Sign up for e-newsletters and check websites for
coupons and specials.</p>
<p>All rooms have mini-fridges and microwaves. Usually, guests can swim all
day after checking out. There may be an extra charge for a Saturday
night-only stay.</p>
<p>All of the big parks are quite noisy and might be overwhelming for young
children.</p>
<p>If you buy a day pass, you might have to pay $5 or more for a locker.</p>
<p>Newer condo units and villas generally are farthest from the water parks
(but quieter).</p>
<p>Check for free or low-cost children's programs. And of course, all of
the bigger hotels also have outdoor water parks.</p>
<p><strong>Day passes:</strong> The Kalahari, Great Wolf,
Chula Vista and Hotel Rome/Mount Olympus sell them. Availability is
limited during peak times, but they do add to lines and congestion.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/dells_chula_vista_mayan.jpg" alt="The lazy river at Chula Vista." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3><a href="https://www.kalahariresorts.com/wisconsin/">Kalahari</a></h3>
<p>This large resort includes lobby shops,
restaurants and a large indoor theme park, and it's next to a 10-screen
cinema.</p>
<p><em>Best features:</em> Its roller-coaster ride, wave pool and long tubing
river. It's the largest water park with 125,000 square feet.</p>
<p>Besides the Ferris wheel and and elevated go cart course, the <a href="https://www.kalahariresorts.com/wisconsin/parks-and-passes/tom-foolerys/">adventure
park</a>
includes Laser Tag, bowling, a climbing wall and a ropes course.</p>
<p><em>Drawbacks:</em> It's huge and sprawling, so guests may have to walk quite
a distance to the water park. It includes a convention center and often
has a convention/party atmosphere. It's right along I-94/90.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.wildernessresort.com/">Wilderness</a></h3>
<p>This is an attractive resort with a north-woods theme, in a wooded
setting just up U.S. 12 from the Kalahari.</p>
<p><em>Best features:</em> Indoor-outdoor hot tubs, wave pool, water park just
for small children, frequent deals.</p>
<p><em>Drawback:</em> It's a long walk between the two parks for older
children.</p>
<p>It has many condos, villas and cabins in satellite complexes. That's
good if you're looking for more serenity or options for a large family
gathering, not so good if you want easy access to the indoor water
parks. The lodgings farther away are connected by shuttle bus.</p>
<p>It has a Laser Tag arena and Dodge 'Em City play area, which includes a
bowling game and climbing maze, the Timberland Play Fort and two 3-D
miniature golf courses.</p>

cannons.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's a handsome resort with a north-woods theme and well-designed,
100,000-square-foot water park.</p>
<p><em>Best features:</em> Raft funnel ride, adjoining water parks.</p>
<p><em>Drawbacks:</em> It's an 89-step climb to the raft funnel ride and, like
its neighbor the Kalahari, it's along the highway.</p>
<p>Its separate indoor play area, MagiQuest, features a wizard theme.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.mtolympuspark.com/">Mount Olympus Resort</a></h3>
<p>The former Treasure Island is an older resort with 87,500 square feet of
indoor water park.</p>
<p><em>Best features:</em> Medusa's Slidewheel rotating slide, loft area for lounging, wave pool,
deals.</p>
<p><em>Drawbacks:</em> Cavernous atmosphere, less attractive decor.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.chulavistaresort.com/">Chula Vista</a></h3>
<p>This is the only resort off the strip, on the bluffs of the Wisconsin
River. It has an 80,000-square-foot indoor water park that includes a
lazy river, raft slides, mat race, tipping bucket and coaster.</p>
<p><em>Best features:</em> Fly'n Mayan roller coaster (good if you don't like
to get wet, bad if you don't like bumps).</p>
<p>The resort has a variety of lodgings, including condos and villas.</p>
<h3>Other resorts with indoor water parks</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.dellspolynesian.com/">Polynesian</a>: This older hotel, on the
west side of the Dells near downtown, has 38,000 square feet of water
parks. The Temple of the Black Pearl is for older children and the Water
Factory for the younger ones.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin Dells Visitor &amp; Convention Bureau lists the larger  <a href="https://www.wisdells.com/blog-stories/Best-Indoor-Waterparks-in-Wisconsin-Dells">indoor water
parks</a>.</p>
<h3>More information</h3>
<p><em>Dining:</em> Many restaurants are in the Lake Delton area, close to the
Wilderness, Kalahari and Great Wolf.</p>
<p>On U.S. 12 near its junction with Wisconsin 23, <a href="http://www.dellsmoosejaw.com/">Moosejaw Pizza &amp;
Brewing Co</a>. has a north-woods lodge
look and brews good beer. 608-254-1122.</p>
