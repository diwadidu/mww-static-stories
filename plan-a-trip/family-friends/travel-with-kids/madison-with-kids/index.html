<p>If it wasn't for the climate, Peter Pan would feel right at home in
Madison, Wis.</p>
<p>It's the NeverNeverland of the Midwest, a town whose zany exuberance is
appreciated by everyone but Republicans, whose outnumbered governor once
called it &quot;57 square miles surrounded by reality.&quot;</p>
<p>Inhabited largely by college students whose political zealotry is
matched only by their zeal for a party, downtown Madison is a place
where it's easy to get in touch with your inner child.</p>
<p>My teen-agers grasped that right away. &quot;I'm so sorry we had to grow
up,&quot; said my daughter Madeleine, watching a clutch of adorable
preschoolers dancing and shaking maracas at the annual International
Festival.</p>
<p>With my son Peter, we'd gone to Madison one February, when the city
offers Hotel Week deals, and we found a city completely geared to
children.</p>
<p>At the Overture Center for the Arts, we saw a play about Harriet Tubman,
heard Caribbean and klezmer concerts, watched Greek and Irish dancers
and marveled at limber Chinese teen-agers who could toss ceramic bowls
onto their heads with one foot while pedaling a unicycle with the other.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Across the street, at the Veterans Museum, we looked through a submarine
periscope at the gleaming dome of the Capitol, which, we learned on a
tour, could hold more ice cream if upturned than any other capitol in
the nation.</p>
<p>And we got a civics lesson, watching state contract workers protest
budget cuts in the Capitol's rotunda and talking with students who had
set up a &quot;refugee camp&quot; to protest the treatment of homeless people in
Madison and Iraq.</p>
<p>The children were even more fascinated by the bohemian trinkets in State
Street shops and by glimpses of the slacker life they, too, could lead
someday.</p>
<p>&quot;Why didn't you tell me to bring my skateboard?&quot; Peter demanded when he
saw the rolling University of Wisconsin campus. &quot;This place is awesome
— I am so going to college here.&quot;</p>
<p>The first night, we walked from our room at the Hilton to the Overture
Center on State Street, where we saw a children's play about the
Underground Railroad.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/a/madison_veterans.jpg" alt="Veterans Museum in Madison." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Veterans Museum on Capitol Square has plenty for children.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The next day, crowds arrived for the free International Festival. In the
main theater, we watched students from the Trinity Academy of Irish
Dance, legs flicking and kicking in uncanny precision.</p>
<p>At the rotunda, where free children's concerts are given every Saturday,
we listened to the irresistible beat of the Goongoo Peas, later
followed by the rollicking Yid Vicious and his klezmer band.</p>
<p>After shopping on State Street, we returned to the hotel, where we
watched the late-afternoon light making patterns on the ice of Lake
Monona.</p>
<p>Then we returned to State Street for a quick dinner at Noodles and a
performance of the New Shanghai Circus, a troupe of young
contortionists, jugglers and gymnasts whose feats made children all
around us gurgle with delight.</p>
<p>The next day was a holiday, and after breakfast at sunny Ancora Coffee
on Capitol Square, we walked over to the Wisconsin Historical Museum. It
was closed, so we went into the Veterans Museum, where Peter was
impressed by the life-size soldiers in a real Vietnam-era helicopter and
a WWII tank.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;I sure saw a lot of awesome guns here,&quot; he said as we walked across
the street to the Capitol.</p>
<p>Its shimmering white granite dome is the city's beacon, high on the
¾-mile-wide isthmus between lakes Monona and Mendota.</p>
<p>The 15-foot golden damsel on top, who has corncobs tucked behind each
ear and wears a miner's helmet with a badger sitting on top, is the
city's highest point and a favorite mascot; inside, we passed a little
girl who kept looking for &quot;the gopher.&quot;</p>
<p>The Capitol, with its imposing marble pillars, statues and murals, sent
children's imaginations into high gear.</p>
<p>&quot;I bet I'm sitting in a chair a murderer has sat in,&quot; Peter said, and
no doubt he was — the gleaming leather chairs of the court room have
been there since 1906, said our tour guide, Kate.</p>

Children love the free tours of the State Capitol.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In the Senate Room, under a gorgeous stained-glass dome, we sat in the
Democrat chairs, which made Kate smile. &quot;Most people want to sit in the
Republican chairs,&quot; she told us.</p>
<p>After the tour, we hung over the rails of the rotunda, listening to the
protesters chant, &quot;Honor my service.&quot;</p>
<p>It was a classic Madison moment, the kind often found around the town.
For big kids as well as little kids, a visit there will be anything but
boring.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Madison for families</h3>
<p><em>Getting around:</em>  Walk when possible; the Overture Center, museums and
Capitol are two blocks from each other.</p>
<p>Driving on the one-ways of the isthmus can be frustrating, and parking
is strictly enforced; read meters and signs or you may be ticketed and
even towed.</p>

the school year, there are free <a href="https://www.overture.org/programs/kids-in-the-rotunda">Kids in the Rotunda
concerts</a> at the
Overture Center.</p>
<p>In summer, it's fun to bicycle on the many trails, which are a good way
to get to beaches, the free <a href="http://www.vilaszoo.org/">Henry Vilas Zoo</a>
and the Sunday water-ski shows on Lake Monona.</p>

<p><em>Accommodations:</em>  In late winter, watch for hotel deals at <a href="https://www.visitmadison.com/">Destination
Madison</a>.</p>
<p>We liked the <a href="http://www.hiltonmadison.com/">Hilton Monona Terrace</a>,
three blocks from Capitol Square. It's on the shore of Lake Monona and
has a pool,.</p>
<p>Madison <a href="http://www.concoursehotel.com">Concourse Hotel</a> and Governor's
Club right on Capitol Square is best-located and has a pool.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rubymarie.com">Hotel Ruby Marie</a> B&amp;B may be a good choice
for a parent with an older child. It's four blocks from Capitol Square
at the point where U.S. 151 (East Washington Avenue) comes out onto Lake
Monona, and its attractive rooms have mini-fridges. The Essen Haus
German restaurant and Come Back In are in the same building.</p>
<p><em>Dining:</em> State Street is lined with interesting, inexpensive cafes
that serve cuisines of many countries.</p>
