<h2>In Wisconsin's Ringlingville, the golden age of the circus never ended.</h2>

<p>In the circus, nothing succeeds like excess. And no one succeeded at
that more than the Ringling brothers.</p>
<p>In the last half of the 19th century, Americans clamored to be amazed.
Tent shows traversed the countryside; Wisconsin alone had more than
100.</p>
<p>On the Mississippi, showboats brought entertainment to river towns. In
1869, two circuses — one was Dan Rice's Own Circus, whose
proprietor's clown character was the inspiration for Uncle Sam — put
on performances in the Iowa river town of McGregor.</p>
<p>They enthralled the 17-year-old son of a poor German harness maker.</p>
<p>With his brothers, Al Ringling started to put on acts for the locals,
and eventually spent seven years traveling with other shows.</p>
<p>In 1884, he and four brothers set up their own tent in Baraboo, Wis., to
which the family had returned nine years before. Al balanced a plow on
his chin, and John danced in wooden shoes.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The brothers ran a tight ship — their circus was called a
&quot;Sunday-school show,&quot; because it kept out swindlers and welcomed
children — and it grew. In 1889, it took to the rails, competing with
Barnum &amp; Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth.</p>
<p>This was the golden age of the circus. Lavish &quot;spectacles&quot; used
costumed casts of 1,000. Menageries overflowed with lions and tigers and
bears — and elephants by the dozen.</p>
<p>Circus wagons were eye-popping, each one a riot of gilded cherubs and
eagles and bare-breasted women.</p>
<p>It was a giddy age, too. The public had an appetite for the exotic, and
it was inflamed by the hyperbole of advance men, who would bill Hindu
dancers, for example, as &quot;beautiful wild Moorish bayadires, in
bewitching dances to the music of native derboukas and flutes.&quot;</p>
<p>Each winter for 35 years, the Ringling brothers brought their circus
back to Baraboo, repairing wagons, training animals and developing new
acts in a riverside complex of 30 buildings that became known as
Ringlingville.</p>
<p>In 1907, they bought their rival and became the biggest circus operation
in the world.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baraboo_clowns_kids.jpg" alt="At Circus World, a clown poses with a boy." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>Today, the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Greatest Show on Earth
still is the biggest. But the golden age — before movies and
television made the exotic ordinary — is over.</p>
<p>Except in Baraboo.</p>
<p>Calliopes still blast away in Baraboo, and elephants parade along the
river. Aerialists spin on ropes, and a ringmaster spins hyperbole.</p>
<p>Gaudy props and costumes from bygone spectacles fill an exhibit hall,
and a pavilion houses the world's largest collection of circus wagons,
some of them still loaded daily onto rail cars.</p>
<p>This is Circus World, a 50-acre complex on the old Ringlingville site
that appeals to what John Ringling called &quot;the universal instinct to be
young again.&quot;</p>
<p>In the summer, circus performers come from all over the world to perform
and live at Circus World, owned by the Wisconsin Historical Society.</p>
<p>When I brought my kids to Circus World, we met Karen and Greg DeSanto,
directors of clowning for Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey at the
Sarasota, Fla., winter quarters.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Here, they really keep tradition, and we can do just good classic
clowning,&quot; said Karen DeSanto, an auguste clown in the style of the
legendary Lou Jacob. &quot;The (regular) circus is very theatrical now. In
this Lazer Tag era, it's hard to make people watch simple people do
extraordinary things.&quot;</p>
<p>It wasn't hard to watch the DeSantos. As Prickly Pete and Polly
Pureheart in a Western sketch and the Swami and his subject in a
hypnotist skit, the two clowns were hysterical, leaving my son Peter
convulsed with laughter.</p>
<p>My daughter Madeleine was transfixed by the children who performed: a
12-year-old from Russia who performed aerial feats on two canvas straps;
10- and 8-year-olds who rode elephants; and 3-year-old who rode a tiny
unicycle with the help of his juggler father.</p>
<p>During our day at Circus World, we did everything we could. We tossed
balls in the You Can Juggle demonstration, rode an elephant and fed
carrot coins to giraffes and camels. We saw the Big Top Circus and its
&quot;awe-inspiring performances that reach beyond the limits of human
endeavor.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just as it did 100 years ago, this sawdust ring will create memories
that will last a lifetime,&quot; announced the charismatic ringmaster in a
rich baritone.</p>
<p>Two young women from Kazakhstan performed aerial feats on a rope,
twisting their limbs every which way, and the enchanting Juliet twirled
hoops. Another juggled with her feet, and the clowns got silly with
strategically placed balloons.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/i/circus_world_calliope.jpg" alt="The America steam calliope at Circus World." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The America steam calliope was assembled in 1940 for the Cole Bros.
Circus and now is part of Circus World's collection.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>My favorite act was strong man Vladimir, a Russian in a Roman
gladiator's outfit who balanced an enormous barbell on his head and
juggled three silver spheres, letting one land on his back and slide
down his arm.</p>
<p>To prove their weight, he tried to give one to a man in the front row,
who couldn't hold it even for a second.</p>
<p>We watched a movie about the Ringling brothers, seven of whom eventually
worked for the circus, and toured the exhibit barns, where we saw a
30,000-piece miniature circus and Emmett Kelly's hobo wardrobe.</p>
<p>In the Hippodrome, we saw the Razzle Dazzle Revue, a vaudeville-style
&quot;after show.&quot;</p>
<p>After T.J. Howell's unicycle act, Peter grabbed my arm. &quot;This place
rocks, big time,&quot; he said, his eyes still glued to the stage.</p>
<p>We watched the performers waving atop elephants and circus wagons in the
street parade and went to the Elephant Encounter, where we got to stroke
Makita, her small eye blinking under a long, long eyelash.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Elephants are really capable of doing anything we ask them to do,&quot;
said her trainer, Jorge Barreda. &quot;Once they understand what you want
them to do, they never forget. Their memory banks are three times larger
than a human's, so it really is true that an elephant never forgets.&quot;</p>
<p>After the season in 2023, however, the elephants will be retired from performing.</p>
<p>And we went to Karen DeSanto's Be a Clown class, where young Jordan
Peters of Appleton won the chance to be made into her auguste twin,
complete with white greasepaint and red bulb nose.</p>
<p>&quot;They're like the only non-scary clown I've seen,&quot; Madeleine said
afterward. &quot;The way she described the circus, I think it'd be fun.&quot;</p>
<p>In fact, Madeleine was a little peeved when I reminded her she hadn't
wanted to visit Circus World, thinking it nothing but a kiddie show.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess this is pretty cool after all,&quot; she said. Not boring? &quot;No!&quot;
she said, shocked. &quot;Not boring at all.&quot;</p>
