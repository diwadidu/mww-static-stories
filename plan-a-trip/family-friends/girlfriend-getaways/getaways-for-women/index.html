<p>When women want to find the perfect travel companions, they know where
to look: each other.</p>
<p>On the road, women can be more adventurous and spontaneous than they are
at home. They also tend to laugh a lot more.</p>
<p>I've traveled with friends, sisters and nieces more than 50 times in
the last 20 years. We like to do all kinds of things: Amish tours,
eagle-watching, horseback-riding, tennis camp and tubing at indoor water
parks and on rivers.</p>
<p>We're too frugal to go to destination spas, but once we fashioned a
do-it-yourself spa weekend. We like to shop as much as anyone, as long
as we also get to hike, bike or ski.</p>
<p>I've learned that the most important thing is finding a cozy place to
talk and sip wine. My friends still talk fondly about the 1943 Finnish
log cabin on Minnesota's North Shore-which I made them leave one
night to see a play about a woman dying of cancer.</p>
<p>It was a good play, but I still feel a little guilty. Fortunately,
friends always forgive you.</p>

<h3>MINNESOTA</h3>
<p>Here are <em>late-fall</em> ideas.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/north-shore-shipwrecks/">Shipwreck tour of Minnesota's North
Shore</a></strong> . Four of
us headed to Lake Superior on a tour of shipwreck sites narrated by me
(with the help of a book) and a stay at the Finn House, a 1943 log
cottage on a point near Lutsen.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/indulgent-retreats/duluth-girlfriend-getaway/">Spa getaway to
Duluth</a></strong> . A
November stay at Fitger's included a half-day of treatments at a day
spa in the historic brewery complex, where there's shopping, live
music, a brewpub and a theater under the same roof.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/o/monroe_baumgartners_friends.jpg" alt="Friends after lunch in Monroe." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On a tasting tour of cheese country, friends emerge from a lunch at
Baumgartner's in Monroe, Wis.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/guided-trips/amish-tours-minnesota/">Amish tours in southeast
Minnesota</a></strong> .
We've done this twice, once in fall and once to do some Christmas
shopping in early December. It's always fascinating.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-mall-america/">Shopping at the Mall of
America</a></strong>
. This mammoth shopping center is irresistible to hard-core shoppers,
and there's no tax on clothing or shoes. It's at its best on a sunny
day midweek.</p>
<p>Here are <em>winter</em> ideas.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/christmas-minneapolis/">Christmas in
Minneapolis</a></strong>
. A girlfriend and I had a luxurious but budget-conscious holiday
weekend, with two-for-one ballet tickets, happy hour, nightclub-hopping,
a parade and a deal at a chic hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Winter in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Lanesboro</a></strong>
. I took my sister, visiting from Florida, to this bluff-country burg in
December to see a play, tour B&amp;Bs, shop at the arts center and walk the
Root River State Trail. Lodging rates drop when the bicycling season
ends, and when there's snow, you can ski the trail.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagles-wabasha/">Eagle-watching in
Wabasha</a></strong> . We've
traveled to this Mississippi River bald-eagle hot spot twice, once in an
unseasonably warm December, when we hiked in the forest above town and
stayed at a B&amp;B, and once on a chilly January weekend.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-stillwater-minnesota/">January shopping in
Stillwater</a></strong>
. Tourists crowd into this St. Croix River Valley town in summer and
fall, but winter is the time to find great deals in clothing stores and
antiques shops.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/itasca-skiing/">Skiing in Itasca State
Park</a></strong> . The
cozy, inexpensive hostel on Lake Itasca is perfect for singles, and
I've stayed there twice, once with a friend and her young daughter and
once with my sister, nieces and daughter, both times skiing the trails
of this scenic northern Minnesota park. <em>BUDGET</em> .</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/naniboujou-lodge-minnesota/">Naniboujou Lodge on Minnesota's North
Shore</a></strong> . You'll
find serenity and good food at this 1929 classic lodge right on Lake
Superior, with snowshoeing/hiking across the highway at Judge C.R.
Magney State Park. There's no nightlife, though Grand Marais is 10
miles down the road.</p>
<p><em>Skiing in Afton State Park</em> . At this village on the St. Croix River,
just east of the Twin Cities, we skied downhill at <a href="http://www.aftonalps.com/">Afton
Alps</a> and cross-country at <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/afton/index.html">Afton State
Park</a>, which
has camper cabins. <em>BUDGET</em> .</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/skiing-in-duluth/">Cross-country skiing in
Duluth</a></strong>
. We rented a cottage on Park Point, shopped at Dewitt-Seitz Marketplace
and skied the lighted trails of Lester Park on the east side of town and
the hillier trails of Magney-Snively Park in West Duluth.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/gunflint-trail-winter/">Skiing on the Gunflint
Trail</a></strong>
. At the end of March, we found ski heaven on the beautifully groomed
trails around Bearskin and Golden Eagle lodges.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/skiing-winona/">Skiing in
Winona</a></strong>
. We followed an early March blizzard down to this Mississippi River
town, taking a guided moonlight snowshoe trek at nearby Whitewater State
Park and skiing at scenic St. Mary's University.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/a/galena_shoppers2.jpg" alt="Shoppers in Galena." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Groups of women like shopping in Galena year-round.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Here are <em>summer</em> ideas.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/state-park-cabins/">Swimming holes on the North
Shore</a></strong> . One July,
my sister, nieces and daughter rented the Illgen Falls cabin on the
Baptism River in Tettegouche State Park. The waterfall outside our door
was refreshing, but we also got to cool off in a swimming hole just
upstream.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/bluff-land/lanesboro-summer-outdoors/">Tubing in
Lanesboro</a></strong>
. Early one June, my niece and I spent an unusually warm weekend tubing
on the Root River and bicycling and in-line skating on the state trail.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/learning-vacations/adult-sports-camps/">Tennis camp in St.
Peter</a></strong>
. A girlfriend and I spent a weekend playing non-stop at the renowned
Tennis &amp; Life program at Gustavus Adolphus College in this Minnesota
River town.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/water-sports/tubing-rivers-midwest/">Tubing the Rum
River</a></strong>
. One August, a girlfriend and I escaped 95-degree heat floating near
Isanti, an hour north of the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>Here are <em>fall</em> ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Brainerd Lakes
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/brainerd-lakes-Minnesota-fall/">outdoors</a></strong>
. In the old mining town of Crosby, Minn., two friends and I rode on the
Cuyuna Lakes State Trail. In nearby Pine River, we hiked and went
horseback-riding.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Shopping in Red
Wing</a></strong> . An
antiques-loving friend and I hit the shops, stayed at the St. James
Hotel and saw a show at the Sheldon Theatre.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/antiques/swedish-towns-minnesota/">Antiquing in
Lindstrom</a></strong> .
An antiques-savvy girlfriend and I got on a motorcoach with other women
and went on a field trip to towns in this Swedish area.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/">Shopping and a concert in
Northfield</a></strong>
. I've taken fall trips to this college town south of the Twin Cities
twice with girlfriends and twice with my husband. It's a good place to
find interesting stocking stuffers and go to a free concert at St. Olaf
College.</p>
<p><em>A class at Wolf Ridge Environment Learning Center on the North Shore</em> .
A friend and I took a class on &quot;Zen and the Art of Photography,&quot;
with late-fall colors as a bonus.</p>
<p>These non-profit centers offer many low-cost weekends; see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/environmental-center/minnesota-environmental-learning/">Minnesota's
environmental learning
centers</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/north-shore-late-fall/">A cabin on the North
Shore</a></strong> .
A trip on the last weekend of October-between the super-packed
Minnesota school break and the start of the Minnesota firearms deer
season-probably is our favorite trip.</p>
<p>We've taken three of them. We rent a cozy cabin on Lake Superior, hike
trails up and down the shore, play games and drink wine. One year, we
also toured the Ship of Ghouls in Duluth's harbor.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/i/wisconsin_wine_women.jpg" alt="Girlfriends on wine trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>WISCONSIN</h3>
<p>Here are <em>winter</em> ideas.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-madison/">Holiday shopping in
Madison</a></strong> .
We made a November foray to State Street, Monroe Street and to the
Winter Art Festival at Monona Terrace, with an evening concert.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/dells-water-parks/">Wisconsin Dells in
November</a></strong> . I took my
twenty-something niece and teen daughter to try out a new indoor water
park and take advantage of discounts, which are best in November and
December.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/superior-wisconsin/">Skiing and museum-hopping around
Superior</a></strong> .
We skied by candlelight in Brule River State Forest and by daylight at
Superior Municipal Forest and heard colorful stories about local
celebrities at the Bong World War II Heritage Center and Fairlawn
Mansion.</p>
<p><strong>Ski class in <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/winter-eagle-river/">Eagle
River</a></strong>
. We took our first stab at skate-skiing at Trees for Tomorrow
environmental-learning center and skied nearby trails.</p>
<p><em>Snowshoeing and skiing along Wisconsin's Wolf River</em> . A girlfriend
and I went on a &quot;snowshoe and massage weekend&quot; at <a href="http://www.bearpawoutdoors.com">Bearpaw Outdoor
Adventure Resort</a> in Nicolet National
Forest, where the snow nearly always is plentiful.</p>
<p><strong>Skiing around <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/spring-green/">Spring
Green</a></strong> . We
stayed at the Frank Lloyd Wright-style House on the Rock Resort, shopped
in the many galleries and skied at nearby Governor Dodge State Park.</p>
<p>Spring Green also is a good destination in summer and fall, especially
if you like to shop and it's your birthday. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/spring-green-birthday/">Wisconsin's
birthday town</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/i/pine_river_horseback_friends.jpg" alt="Friends ride horses near Pine River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

country near Brainerd.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/skiing-telemark-resort-cable/">Skiing in
Cable</a></strong> .
A girlfriend and I stayed at the old Telemark Resort and skied, tubed,
took a sleigh ride and sat in the hot tub.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/winter-wausau/">Skiing around
Wausau</a></strong> .
We skied cross-country and went to the local art museum; there's also
the fine Granite Peak downhill slope, snowshoeing in a state park and
tubing in a county park.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/spring-skiing-up-whitecap/">St. Patrick's Day skiing at Whitecap Mountains near
Hurley</a></strong>
. We worked on our tans on this scenic slope in northeast Wisconsin and
across the Michigan border at Big Powderhorn.</p>
<p>Here are <em>spring</em> ideas.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadside-attractions/fountain-city/">A bluffside cottage in Fountain
City</a></strong> . I took
my daughter and one of her girlfriends to stay at the Hawks View
Cottages in this Mississippi River town and see the Prairie Moon
Sculpture Garden and Rock in the House.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/dells-water-parks/">Indoor water parks of the Wisconsin
Dells</a></strong> . This is a popular
spring-break trip, and I took one with a friend and our daughters and
once with a surfer friend who wanted to try out the Kalahari's
FlowRider.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/wisconsin-muir-tour/">On the trail of famous Wisconsin naturalists near
Baraboo</a></strong> .
One May, we toured Aldo Leopold's famous shack, visited the
International Crane Foundation and John Muir's childhood home and
walked in Parfrey's Glen, Wisconsin's first natural area.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_golden_eagle_skiers.jpg" alt="Skiers glide along trails at Golden Eagle on the Gunflint Tr" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In March, the Gunflint Trail is heaven for cross-country skiers.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/cruises-in-lacrosse/">Beer in La Crosse</a></strong> .
A sister and I toured the brewery, went to a musical and watched eagles
from Grandad Bluff. There's more to do in summer and fall.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/birding-tiffany-wildlife-area/">Bird-watching along the Chippewa
River</a></strong>
. One May, a bird-watching friend and I rented a cabin on the Chippewa
River near Durand and got onto a mini-train car to go birding in the
Tiffany Bottoms area of the river.</p>
<p>Here are <em>summer</em> ideas.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/">Variety in Door County</a></strong> .
This is the perfect destination for women who like a lot of choice. You
can go the indulgence route-shopping, taking cruises and cooking
classes, visiting wineries and spas-or ride bikes, swim at beaches
and hike in parks and nature sanctuaries.</p>
<p>I like to go in early June or late August, when the weather is good,
it's not crowded and you can good deals on lodgings.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/chippewa-falls-wisconsin/">Tubes and beer in Chippewa
Falls</a></strong>
. One warm day, a girlfriend and I traveled to Chippewa Falls, Wis., to
tour the Leinenkugel's brewery and take a leisurely tube float down the
Chippewa River.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/wisconsin-river-sauk-city-arena-merrimac/">Exploring the Wisconsin
River</a></strong>
. A girlfriend and her sister showed me their favorite spots to paddle,
hike and shop around the twin towns of Prairie du Sac and Sauk City.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/beer-tour-wisconsin/">Brewery and pub tour of southern
Wisconsin</a></strong>
. A fellow beer lover and I made a pilgrimage from Capital Brewery in
Madison to Mount Horeb, Mineral Point, New Glarus and Janesville.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/a/eagle_bluff_girlfriends.jpg" alt="Women at Eagle Bluff." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Girlfriends try the high ropes course at Eagle Bluff near Lanesboro.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Here are <em>fall</em> ideas.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/walking-lake-geneva/">Walking in Lake
Geneva</a></strong>
. You can walk the 20-mile lakeshore path past Gilded Age mansions or
you can walk the shop-lined streets of downtown-your choice.</p>
<p>Locals say September is the best month, when the summer crowds are gone
but the fall-color rush hasn't started. May and early June also are
good times to go.</p>
<p><em>Black Hawk's trail and the Mississippi River</em> . A girlfriend and I
spent a September weekend in Wisconsin's <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/vernon-county-wisconsin/">Vernon
County</a>
following the flight of Black Hawk in 1832, making stops at scenic river
overlooks and attending Pickwick Mill Day in the bluffs south of Winona.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/vineyards-wisconsin-river-valley/">Vineyard tour of the Wisconsin River
Valley</a></strong>
. Five of us made a harvest-time trip up the Wisconsin River, from
Spurgeon Vineyards near Muscoda to Botham near Barneveld and Wollersheim
in Prairie du Sac, with stops to hike and enjoy the fall colors.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/wisconsin-shopping-trip/">Shopping in southwest
Wisconsin</a></strong>
. Six of us made a pre-Christmas foray, stopping at the Company Store
outlet in La Crosse, five stores that sell cut-rate Land's End catalog
returns, the galleries of Mineral Point and a shoe emporium.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/cornish-fest-mineral-point/">Cornish Fest in Mineral
Point</a></strong>
. Four of us took a trip to our favorite shopping town, this time for
the late-September Cornish Fest and a stay at the lovely Maple Wood
Lodge. While we were there, we took a swing through cheese country,
visiting <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-glarus-wisconsin/">New
Glarus</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/cheese-country-wisconsin/">Monroe</a>.</p>
<h3>ILLINOIS</h3>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/ethnic-chicago/">Ethnic neighborhoods of
Chicago</a></strong> . One
Memorial Day, a girlfriend and I watched the parade downtown, then
toured the East Indian, Swedish and Chinese neighborhoods, stuffing
ourselves with samosas, almond pastries and dim sum.</p>
<p>Chicago has something for everyone in every season-foodies, museum
lovers, baseball fans, bicyclists and, of course, shoppers. For more,
see <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/best-chicago-trip-planning/">Chicago as you like
it</a>.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/t/stillwater_shopping.jpg" alt="Shoppers walk along Main Street in Stillwater." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In the St. Croix River town of Stillwater, streets are lined with gift
shops.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/galena-getaway/">Getaway to
Galena</a></strong> . Strangely,
I've been to this classic chick town only alone, with my preteen son
and with my husband. Needless to say, women love its shops and inns.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-geneva-st-charles-illinois/">Bicycling between St. Charles, Geneva and
Batavia</a></strong>
. This is the perfect trip if you have a group that likes a leisurely
