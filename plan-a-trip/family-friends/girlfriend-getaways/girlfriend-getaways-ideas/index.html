<h2>At vacation spots everywhere, women are on the lookout for fun. Here's how to plan a getaway.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/e/cedarburg_red_hat_ladies.jpg" alt="Girlfriends in Cedarburg." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
During the annual Strawberry Festival in Cedarburg, Wis., a trio of
friends take a break for strawberry wine.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Everywhere I go, I see groups of women out having fun. Women on bikes.
Women on skis. Women shopping, sightseeing and sampling.</p>
<p>Often, they're wearing the tell-tale colors of the Red Hat Society, a
loose-knit organization of older women whose mission is to have fun.</p>
<p>One June, I spotted three of them at Strawberry Festival in Cedarburg,
Wis., having some laughs over a bottle of strawberry wine. They'd
driven up from the southern Wisconsin town of Orfordville for the day,
one of many trips they take throughout the year.</p>
<p>&quot;We're taking them all the time,&quot; says Lin Newman, who founded one of
five Red Hat chapters in her town of 1,200. &quot;We get a chance to giggle.
There's just a sense of freedom. We can let our hair down. It's an
opportunity to be wacky. There are no rules.&quot;</p>
<p>They go to nearby Fort Atkinson for a dinner-theater production of
&quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and a fashion show. They go to Mackinac Island
for the scenery and fudge.</p>
<p>In summer, they'll have pajama parties at Newman's cottage in Lake
Geneva, then hop the train to Chicago for the museums and shopping. (For
ideas, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/girlfriend-getaways/12-months-girlfriend-getaways-midwest/">12 months of girlfriend
getaways</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/girlfriend-getaways/getaways-for-women/">50 great
girlfriend getaways</a>.)</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>So what does her husband do?</p>
<p>&quot;He likes to go to car shows,&quot; Newman said.</p>
<p>These days, trips for women are big business. Budget Travel magazine
devotes special issues just to them, noting that &quot;we can't leave our
offices outside Times Square without running into a group of women
giggling their way down Seventh Avenue.&quot;</p>
<p>National Geographic has published &quot;50 Best Girlfriends Getaways in
North America,&quot; explaining that trips by women, including mothers,
daughters and sisters, &quot;have become a driving force in the travel
industry.&quot;</p>
<p>Oprah Winfrey and her best friend, Gayle King, took 50 readers of O
magazine to Miraval Resort in Arizona for a week. Women can book a trip
with Adventures in Good Company, Women Traveling Together,
AdventureWomen, Adventurous Wench, Gutsy Women Travel or the Women's
Travel Club.</p>
<p>Hotels and inns have jumped on the bandwagon, too. In big cities, they
may include such features as martinis, trips to male strip clubs and
&quot;lingerie makeovers,&quot; but in the Upper Midwest, packages are more
likely to include yoga, scrapbooking and wine tasting.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/m/i/minneapolis_fair_shopping.jpg" alt="Stone Arch Festival in Minneapolis." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>But women do a lot more than gab and gossip over bonbons and chardonnay.</p>
<p>Sher Lawrence of Chetek, Wis., has traveled with her five sisters-in-law
every year for more than two decades, always renting lodges or cabins in
such places as Door County, Galena and the Cable area. They shop, cook,
do art projects, golf, visit state parks and see what else there is to
do.</p>
<p>&quot;We like to do new things and try new places,&quot; she says. &quot;It's our
time to get together and reconnect, to keep the bond really strong
between us. We've turned on two or three other groups to this, too;
they think it's awesome.&quot;</p>
<p>They invited their husbands on the 20th trip, but Lawrence says they'll
never do that again.</p>
<p>&quot;They wanted to have a schedule, and they were so concerned about
meals,&quot; she said. &quot;We tend to fly by the seat of our pants a little
more.&quot;</p>
<p>When Judith Niemi of St. Paul founded Woodswomen in 1977, she was in the
vanguard of two trends: adventure travel and travel for women. In those
early days, she says, women rarely were seen in the wilderness without
men.</p>
<p>&quot;We'd be canoeing in the Boundary Waters and a man would say, 'My
God, are you out here all alone?' and he'd be talking to 12 people,&quot;
she said. &quot;Now, it's perfectly ordinary.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>These days, she often goes on jaunts with a loose group of friends who
call themselves the Sturdy Girls: &quot;Typically, someone will say, 'Time
for a Sturdy Girls float,'&quot; she says. &quot;We'll go to the St. Croix,
float through the backwaters and go bird-watching for a day.&quot;</p>
<p>It's no mystery why girlfriend getaways have become so popular, Niemi
says.</p>
<p>&quot;Women love traveling with other women because it's so much fun,&quot; she
says. &quot;It's entirely, tremendously fun.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Planning a girlfriend getaway</h3>
<p><em>Getting started:</em> First, assess budgets. You can save a lot of money by
traveling weekdays, in the off-season or in less-touristy spots. Then
find out what the group wants to do-mostly sit around and talk, for
example, or get out and about.</p>
<p><em>Finding accommodations:</em> Ask who minds sharing beds and who doesn't.
B&amp;Bs may seem like a good choice, but few have rooms with more than one
bed, and they don't always have good gathering spaces. Small inns often
work better, and some offer special women's getaways in their off
seasons.</p>

<p>A condo or lodge may be most practical, since they have kitchens and
living rooms. Sher Lawrence of Chetek, Wis., says she's had good luck
using <a href="http://www.vrbo.com">Vacation Rentals by Owner</a>. Another good
site is <a href="http://www.homeaway.com">HomeAway</a>.</p>
<p>Tourist web sites also list vacation homes; look for &quot;vacation
rentals.&quot; Or use a search engine, typing in the name of the area in
which you're interested with &quot;vacation rental condos&quot; or
&quot;cottages.&quot;</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/vacation-cottage-house-rentals/">Renting a vacation
house</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/cottage-rentals-midwest/">A cottage
of one's own</a>.</p>
<p>State parks and non-profit clubs often rent lodges that are perfect for
groups and also inexpensive (see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/groups/group-lodges/">Cabins for a
crowd</a> ).</p>
<p>In Minnesota, St. Croix State Park near Hinckley rents two guesthouses,
one with eight bedrooms and 14 beds and the other with six bedrooms and
10 beds, $180.</p>
<p>Decor is modest, but both have very well-equipped kitchens. Along with
other guesthouses and cabins, they can be reserved up to a year in
advance. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/minnesota-state-park-cabins/">Lodgings in Minnesota state
parks</a>.</p>
<p><em>Packages:</em> For lower-cost weekends, look to non-profits, such as
<a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/environmental-center/minnesota-environmental-learning/">Minnesota's environmental learning
centers</a>. From Minneapolis, <a href="http://www.wildernessinquiry.com">Wilderness
Inquiry</a> offers women's trips on the
Superior Hiking Trail, kayaking in the Apostles and canoeing in the
BWCAW.</p>
<p><em>Destinations:</em> On Lake Michigan, <strong>Door County</strong>
is a very popular destination and the only
Upper Midwest destination listed in &quot;50 Best Girlfriends Getaways&quot;
(National Geographic, $15.95) by Marybeth Bond, who lists it in her
&quot;Retail Therapy&quot; section.</p>
<p>It's popular with Chicagoans and best known for its city-style
attractions-shopping, theater, art, fine dining-but it also
offers wonderful bicycling, kayaking, wildflower-hunting, bird-watching,
hiking and swimming.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It has lots of condos, cottages and other lodgings. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/">Door
County</a> stories.</p>
<p>In northwest Illinois, <strong>Galena</strong> is a
classic girlfriend getaway, and the tourism folks say half its 50 B&amp;Bs
have rooms with more than one bed.</p>
<p>There are lots of shops, restaurants and renovated historic houses to
tour, and many events geared toward women-wine tastings, craft
demonstrations, cooking classes, walking tours, art shows. For more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/galena-getaway/">Galena getaway</a>.</p>
<p>Not far away in southwest Wisconsin, <strong>Mineral Point</strong>
has plenty of galleries and shops, but
it's less commercial and more personable.</p>
<p>The National Trust named Mineral Point one of its 2007 Dozen Distinctive
Destinations, calling it an &quot;architectural treasure trove&quot; and citing
the &quot;abundant beauty of its pastoral setting.&quot;</p>
<p>Shake Rag Alley Center for the Arts offers workshops year-round (see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/learning-vacations/shake-rag-alley/">Slinging cement in Mineral
Point</a> ),
and the Pendarvis historic site showcases the town's Cornish heritage.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/mineral-point-art-tour/">Beauty in Mineral
Point</a>. For more on Mineral Point's Fall Art Tour and other fall studio
tours, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/art-fairs/midwest-fall-art-tours/">Autumn in the
studios</a>.</p>
<p>Eight friends can rent the entire <a href="http://www.mineralpointhotel.com/">Mineral Point
Hotel</a>, which has two rooms with two
queen beds and two with kings, for $400, including a continental
breakfast. Down the street, the <a href="http://www.brewerycreek.com">Brewery Creek
Inn</a> includes three rooms with sleeper
sofas, and there's a pleasant pub and restaurant.</p>

Mosaic Madness weekend.

<p>On 26 acres outside Mineral Point, the three-bedroom <a href="http://www.maplewoodlodge.com">Maple Wood
Lodge</a> is very handsome and comfortable
for a small group. Reserve far in advance for the big October <a href="http://www.fallarttour.com">Fall Art
Tour</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Duluth</strong> has plenty of shopping and
several spas, but it's best known for outdoor activities-hiking,
bird-watching, boat-watching.</p>
<p>Near downtown, the charming <a href="http://www.hillsidecottageduluth.com">Hillside
Cottage</a> has a view of the harbor
and makes a perfect place for a girlfriends' getaway, with three
bedrooms, five beds, three baths and a kitchen. On Park Point, the
<a href="http://www.cottageonthepoint.com/">Cottage on the Point</a> has three
bedrooms, one with twin beds. For more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/duluth/">Duluth</a> stories.</p>
<p>In northern Wisconsin, <strong>Bayfield</strong> also has
a nice mixture of shopping and outdoorsy activities. From the
picturesque hillside village on Lake Superior, guests can hike, bike,
sail, or take a cruise boat to the Apostle Islands or a ferry to
Madeline Island, where Big Bay State Park has lovely beaches.</p>
<p>There are many condos, cottages and houses for rent both in
<a href="http://www.bayfield.org">Bayfield</a> and <a href="http://www.madelineisland.com">Madeline
Island</a>. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/interesting-towns/bayfield-summer-wisconsin/">Beloved
Bayfield</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/madeline-island-wisconsin/">Madeline's
magnetism</a>.</p>
<p>In southeast Minnesota, <strong>Lanesboro</strong> is a
bicycling hub that also is known for its canoeing, tubing, theater and
Amish tours. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">The belle of bluff
country</a>
and <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-root-river-trail/">Bicycling in bluff
country</a>.</p>
<p>Half an hour north of Milwaukee, <strong>Cedarburg</strong>
is a beautifully preserved Yankee mill
town that has many small, unique shops and also is a stop on the Ozaukee
Interurban Trail; the stretch from Cedarburg to Port Washington, on Lake
Michigan, is one of the prettiest.</p>
<p>Cedarburg's 1886 Washington House Inn B&amp;B has 34 rooms, many of which
have two beds, sofa sleepers or kings. For more on the town and
festivals, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/cedarburg-wisconsin/">Jolly
Cedarburg</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Chicago</strong> is perhaps the ultimate
girlfriend getaway; it has the region's best shopping, museums,
restaurants, festivals, music-you name it.</p>
<p>Accommodations are pricey in summer (though budget travelers can stay at
Hostelling International's popular and well-located <a href="http://www.hichicago.org/">Chicago
hostel</a> ) so consider other seasons; it's an
exciting place to be year-round. For more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/">Chicago</a>
stories.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.redhatsociety.com">Red Hat Society:</a> This national
organization for women 50 and older &quot;began as a result of a few women
deciding to greet middle age with verve, humor and elan,&quot; writes
founder Sue Ellen Cooper.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe silliness is the comedy relief of life, and since we are
all in it together, we might as well join red-gloved hands and go for
the gusto together. Underneath the frivolity, we share a bond of
affection, forged by common life experiences and a genuine enthusiasm
for wherever life takes us next.&quot;</p>
