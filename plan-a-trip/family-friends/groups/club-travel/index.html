<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/gunflint_golden_eagle_skiers.jpg" alt="Skiers glide along trails at Golden Eagle on the Gunflint Tr" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On a March trip to Minnesota's Gunflint Trail, the North Stars ski near

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Collectively, no one knows more about traveling in the Upper Midwest
than its outdoors clubs.</p>
<p>Club members organize dozens of excursions year-round — hiking,
paddling, skiing — and they know all the best places. Once, I thought
I'd made a real discovery — High Point Village, an appealing little
resort with 10 miles of hiking and skiing loops around  the foot of
Timm's Hill, Wisconsin's highest point.</p>
<p>It turned out the Twin Cities-based North Star Ski Touring Club already
had found it and reserved it for one of their trips.</p>
<p>When you can't beat 'em, join 'em. So I did.</p>
<p>My first trip with the North Stars was to Bemidji in northern Minnesota.
After everyone arrived, we played an ice-breaking game in which each
person had to tell two truths and a lie about himself, and the others
had to guess the lie.</p>
<p>The most outlandish claims - beaten in Egypt and left for dead?
Mistakenly arrested in Guatemala for drug trafficking? Hiking in the
Himalayas, riding camels in Tunisia, kayaking in the Yukon? — turned
out to be the truths.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>I probably should have been intimidated right then by these
well-traveled people, but they were so darn friendly. They turned out to
be ringers on the ski trails, too.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, we skied three cross-country trails and downhill, too.
John Driscoll, the trip coordinator, had skied all the trails and knew
which were appropriate for beginners and which would be safest to ski
under icy conditions.</p>
<p>With the North Stars, I've skied in Mille Lacs Kathio State Park when a
hoarfrost and a full moon put an extra layer of magic on the park's
annual candlelight ski.</p>
<p>I've skied in Duluth right after a March blizzard dumped 30 inches on
the town, and I've bicycled with them around the Wisconsin town of
Bayfield.</p>
<p>I'm also a member of the Twin Cities-based Minnesota Rovers Outdoors
Club.</p>
<p>With the Rovers, I've snowshoed from waterfall to waterfall on the
Black River in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, canoed the Upper Iowa River
near Decorah and hiked the Ice Age National Scenic Trail from Devil's
Lake State Park in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>The trips rarely cost more than $100. But the camaraderie is priceless.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_lodge_bicyclists.jpg" alt="Bicyclists in Whitewater State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Rovers get ready for a bike ride from the group center at Minnesota's
Whitewater State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>You can join right away or you can try out the clubs on day trips. The
Rovers offer an ongoing Beginners Series that includes introductions to
cross-country skiing, alpine skiing and snowshoeing in winter and, in
summer, backpacking, Boundary Waters canoeing and rock-climbing.</p>
<p>The North Stars offer ski clinics and, like most clubs, make sure
beginners and newcomers are paired with a more experienced member who
will go at a slower pace.</p>
<p>&quot;It's tempting to look into a room of Spandex-covered butts and think,
'Gee, I don't belong here,' &quot; says Jean Iwen of St. Paul, a former
president of the North Stars' singles division.</p>
<p>&quot;But when I started, there was this older couple who said, 'Oh, ski
with us, we wanted to take it easy today,' even though both of them can
ski circles around me. They were just incredibly nice; the feeling of
intimidation was in my own head, not something put upon me.&quot;</p>
<p>The North Stars like running water and roofs over their heads, but they
still manage to keep most weekend costs around $100.</p>
<p>The Rovers are known as penny-pinchers, and their trips cost even less
because they camp or stay in rustic cabins and prepare their own meals.
Camping and backpacking trips generally cost $15-$25.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In late October, their annual Halloween party/hiking and biking trip to
Minnesota Whitewater State Park costs $65, including food and three
nights in heated cabins.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone pitches in. When Pat Ryan of St. Paul was
co-coordinator for the Whitewater trip, other people took deposits,
planned menus, bought food and put up decorations for the Halloween
party.</p>
<p>&quot;The good thing about going with a group is that other people take a
chunk; you don't have to do everything,&quot; she said. &quot;That's the
beauty of it. &quot;</p>
<p>Each club has a distinct personality. The North Stars are known as a
mellow group that doesn't drink much but likes good food and a dance;
they're also meticulous trip planners.</p>
<p>The Rovers are more spontaneous; many of their trips are proposed at the
last minute on the club's Yahoo group.</p>
<p>Many members like a good party, but preferences are varied; on the
Whitewater trip, cabins were designated for night owls, early risers and
light sleepers.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/r/o/rovers_morris_tree.jpg" alt="Rovers in a tree in Morris." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On their way to a horseback-riding trip in South Dakota, members of the
Rovers climb a tree in a Morris, Minn., city park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The primarily downhill ski clubs have a more party-loving reputation,
though most have calmed down from the hard-drinking days in the 1970s
and '80s.</p>
<p>Though cost savings are a good reason to join a club, most do it because
they like the society of others. Linda Flick of Woodbury, Minn., joined
the North Stars when she was new to town and wanted to meet people.</p>
<p>&quot;I like to ski, and I like to ski with friends,&quot; she says. &quot;You
have to go on a number of trips to kind of know who you're comfortable
with. But even if you don't see a friend, you'll find people to ski
with.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Traveling with clubs</h3>
<p>All of the clubs below welcome new members. Those who don't live where
the group is based can join the group at trip destinations.</p>
<p>Many have e-mail groups on Yahoo, and members can send and receive
notices for last-minute day trips and social outings. Many groups offer
free lessons and keep equipment cages from which members can borrow gear
for trips.</p>
<p>Many clubs also offer trips to Europe, Canada, the Rockies and New
England.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a club near you, ask at local bicycle, ski or
outdoors stores, which also are likely to stock club brochures.</p>
<p>And check for local <a href="http://www.meetup.com/">Meetup groups</a>. These
loosely organized groups focus on many outdoor interests, including
backpacking, hiking, walking, cross-country skiing and general
adventure.</p>
