<h2>At Deep Portage in northern Minnesota, adults take a tip from the kids.</h2>

<p>As adults, we sometimes forget how great it is to be a kid.</p>
<p>People give you toys to play with. They show you new games and explain
things in interesting ways. They feed you freshly baked cookies and
s'mores.</p>
<p>Kids take it for granted. But I didn't one January, when I got to stay
at Deep Portage Learning Center, in the woods north of Brainerd.</p>
<p>Deep Portage is the largest of Minnesota's environmental-learning
centers, with seven lakes and nearly 10 square miles of forest set on
rolling glacial moraine. There's a handsome cedar and fieldstone lodge
with an indoor climbing wall.</p>
<p>There's an orienteering course in the woods, plus snowshoeing and 11
miles of groomed trails for skiing.</p>
<p>There's ice fishing, broomball and curling on the lakes.</p>
<p>Basically, Deep Portage is a big playground, and it's open to everyone.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Schoolchildren from around the state get to use it during the week, when
they stay for several days at a time. They play voyageur games, build
quinzees in the snow and learn how to track animals and use a compass.</p>
<p>On weekends, the center is open to adults, who can do exactly the same
things. But they also can relax by the fire with a thriller, have a
glass of wine, stay up late playing board games or go out to watch the
stars.</p>
<p>Kid-style fun with grown-up freedom: It's the perfect combo.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just wonderful to come up and do as much as you want to,&quot; says
Linda Paige of Grand Rapids, Minn., who came to play and ski during a winter weekend with 20 members of her kayaking club, the
Paddle Pushers.</p>
<p>Deep Portage can't afford to advertise much, but in 2004, director Dale
Yerger bought a Ginzu groomer and started promoting Deep Portage as
&quot;Minnesota's best-kept secret in Nordic ski destinations.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We've been working for a couple of years to get the word out,&quot; he
said. &quot;Of course, if we get two or three feet of snow, it could get
people thinking.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/deep_portage_climbing.jpg" alt="Climbing wall at Deep Portage." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Guests get to use the climbing wall.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>There was an inch of fresh snow when we were there, and some guests did
ski on Big Deep Lake. But there was so much else offered that many of us
decided to tag along with the six young naturalists, like the big kids
we were.</p>
<p>The first evening, after a dinner of homemade chili and corn chowder, we
went on a night hike with Katie Colvin and Bekah Holman, and on Bass
Pond, Colvin had us pretend we were pirates, covering one eye with our
hands while looking into her flashlight.</p>
<p>When we uncovered our eye, the night suddenly seemed much brighter.</p>
<p>&quot;What were the pirates looking for?&quot; Colvin asked. &quot;Treasure. And
where was it? Down in the hold, where it's dark. Pirates wore patches
so they could go into the dark and find the treasure.&quot;</p>
<p>On the trail, she handed out crayons and told us to write our names and
the color of the crayon. Only one person got the color right.</p>
<p>&quot;It has to do with the rods and cones in our eyes,&quot; Colvin said. &quot;The
cones are for color, and they're not doing a very good job because they
need a lot of light. The rods are working overtime because there's not
very much light.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The next morning, after a breakfast of eggs, potatoes and
lemon-poppyseed cake, we went out to play games — pretending we were
Indian boys hunting rabbits with heavy sticks, except we tossed our
sticks at coffee cans; trying to throw tomahawks into a stump, a skill
needed by hunters and sawyers; and flinging spears with the help of an
atlatl, an Aztec word for spear-thrower.</p>
<p>Then we followed naturalist Casey Stanley to the observation tower
— &quot;55 feet of fun,&quot; he said — for a wind-whipped view of the
terrain, where glaciers pushed rubble into hills and dumped chunks of
ice that became ponds.</p>
<p>The next activities were ice-fishing and climbing.</p>
<p>On the climbing wall, six rope lines dangled over three stories of
brightly colored and oddly shaped knobs that, to my surprise, were not
always easy to grasp.</p>
<p>On my second climb, naturalist Stanley
helped by calling out Twister-style instructions: &quot;Left foot on
yellow,&quot; and &quot;look for the white coconut.&quot;</p>
<p>We didn't exactly scale the wall like monkeys, but we did it. Shelly
Greenwood of Andover, Minn., was as worn-out but exhilarated as I was: &quot;I
hadn't done that before, but I think I'd like to do more,&quot; she said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/deep_portage_guests.jpg" alt="Deep Portage guests on a subzero day." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the ice-fishing group had seen a lot of ice, but no fish.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad I had the experience, but I don't think I need to do it
again,&quot; said Karen Gromala of St. Paul.</p>
<p>We got our competitive juices flowing on the orienteering course, where
naturalist Becca Zaffke sent four teams tearing through the woods with
compasses, two-way radios, a topo map and a sheet listing the number of
paces and compass setting required to find six numbered poles.</p>
<p>My team found the first four poles, usually 30 paces and to the right of
where we thought they'd be, but we came up blank on the fifth, and so
did another team.</p>
<p>We crashed around in the brush for a while, but it was getting dark, so
we gave up and called for directions back to the lodge. When we asked
where the darn thing was, naturalist Laura Nordaas was sympathetic.</p>
<p>&quot;It's on a rise, but everything's on a rise,&quot; she said. &quot;Don't
feel bad; it's one of the toughest ones to find.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>For dinner, the Deep Portage cooks had prepared pork tenderloin, mashed
potatoes and gravy, green beans and chocolate cake. Afterward, Nordaas
went out to build a bonfire and offered s'mores, but nobody budged.</p>
<p>We were finished with the outdoors that day; the kayakers were hunkered
down in front of the dining-hall fire, and many of the rest of us were
playing Taboo and Yahtzee.</p>
<p>By morning, the temperature had plunged to 15 below, but we still went
on an animal-signs hike through the bog with educator Tyler Behrends.</p>
<p>Winter is the only time anyone can go through it, he said, as we walked
over spongy beds of bog grass and followed narrow channels where
stagnant water would collect in spring.</p>
<p>Beavers had built lodges in the bog, and we checked three lodges until
we found someone at home — we knew because we could see puffs of
beaver breath coming out of a vent. It was one of the coolest animal
signs we'd ever seen.</p>
<p>On the way back, we found not only deer beds among the pine needles but
the deer themselves, and Behrends saw a snowshoe hare hopping away.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/e/deep_portage_atlatl.jpg" alt="Atlatl throwers at Deep Portage Conservation Reserve." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

the bow and arrow.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>But we still were thinking about beavers, and at the lodge, we gathered
in the theater and Behrends showed us amazing underwater footage of
beavers from the BBC series &quot;The Life of Mammals.&quot;</p>
<p>At Deep Portage, everyone's a friend of animals, but that goes
hand-in-hand with hunting. The center was founded in 1973 on
tax-forfeited county land, with help from the Izaak Walton League, and
in summer the staff teaches hunting and fishing to youths as well as
adults.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes, when we say 'environmental learning center,' it conjures
up preservation, tree-hugging and scratching Bambi between the ears,&quot;
said director Yerger. &quot;So then people are shocked that we teach kids
how to shoot deer — and clean and butcher them, too.&quot;</p>
<p>The Deep Portage schedule includes programs on rifle-sighting, bird-banding and gun-dog training. And people from the
community or nearby resorts often come by to join naturalist hikes or
have wild mushrooms identified.</p>
<p>&quot;We try to have a great diversity,&quot; Yerger says. &quot;The common thread
is environmental literacy, outdoor skills and education.&quot;</p>
<p>The campus makes its guests so comfortable that people who stay there
sometimes forget it's a school, not a resort.</p>
<p>&quot;People ask me about Jacuzzis and hot tubs, and I always say, 'Hmm,
that sounds a little resorty,' &quot; Yerger said. &quot;We're really more of
a ski camp.&quot;</p>
