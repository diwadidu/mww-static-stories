State Park near Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

<p>I applaud anyone who takes on the job of planning a family reunion.</p>
<p>When more than a few branches of a family are involved, planning a
reunion requires the strategic skills of a general, the diplomacy of an
envoy and the social agility of an emcee.</p>
<p>In other words, plan carefully, because it's hard to make everyone
happy.</p>
<p><em>First, find out what people really want.</em>  Are they expecting to spend
most of their time reacquainting themselves with far-flung family
members, or more time acquainting themselves with the golf course and
swim-up bar?</p>
<p><em>Next, think about cost.</em>  Failure to accommodate even one family on a
budget can result in lasting resentment that poisons the family well
rather than replenishes it.</p>
<p>It's easiest to choose a destination everyone can afford. But when
Coloradans Mary Beth Solano planned a family reunion at Snow Mountain
Ranch, they asked some of the families in their 55-member group to give
a little extra, so others wouldn't have to pay so much.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Keep a careful record of who pays what,&quot; Solano adds. &quot;I sent out a
newsletter once a month, telling people what the prices were.&quot;</p>
<p>When money is tight, choose a resort with cabins or condos with
kitchens, so those who need to can prepare their own meals.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/groups/group-lodges/">Cabins for a crowd</a>. Houses rented
through Airbnb or VRBO often sleep 20 or more people, and the per-person
cost is low.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/cottage-rentals-VRBO/">Adventures in
renting</a>.</p>
<p><em>Try to come up with a location everyone can get to easily.</em>  LaVerne
Pasko of Palatine, Ill., saw Great Wolf Lodge in the Wisconsin Dells
while making the seven-hour drive to the Twin Cities; it was exactly
halfway.</p>
<p>&quot;Half of our family is in the Twin Cities and half is in Chicago, so
that was perfect,&quot; she says.</p>
<p><em>When choosing a resort, pay only for what you'll use.</em>  If there
aren't any small children in the group, there's no sense in choosing a
place where child care is included in the price.</p>
<p>The same goes for resorts that include greens fees and such expensive
activities as water-skiing, unless you've got golfers and water
daredevils.</p>

Minnesota's Brainerd Lakes area.

<p><em>Take an inventory of interests.</em>  In Nancy Reynolds' family, for
example, three of her husband's brothers love to golf and fish, and the
13 children love to swim.</p>
<p>But the Minneapolis pastry chef likes resorts that are near antique
shops and interesting little towns she and her sisters-in-law can
explore.</p>
<p>&quot;If you just had to go and stay in one place,&quot; she says, &quot;that would
be missing the boat.&quot; Identifying interesting spots nearby is
especially important for family reunions that, like Reynolds', last
more than three days: A little jaunt can cure a case of too much
togetherness.</p>
<p>Don't forget to poll family members on privacy, too. Reynolds admits
she's picky about that: &quot;I don't want to be tiptoeing around someone
who's sleeping late.&quot;</p>
<p>If privacy is an issue, choose a resort that offers a variety of
lodgings, such as four-bedroom condos for families who don't mind a
gaggle of cousins running in and out, and one-bedroom condos on the
other end of the resort for those families who prefer a quieter retreat.</p>

<h3>Trip Tips: Planning a family reunion</h3>
<p>The nuts and bolts of planning a family reunion start after a location
is chosen. If you choose a big resort, it likely has staff members who
are happy to help with the planning. Still, there are several things to
keep in mind:</p>
<p><em>Start early.</em>  Six months may be enough lead time, but a year is
better, especially if a reunion is planned for July or August. At YMCA
of the Rockies' Estes Park Center, for example, it's best to reserve
two years in advance.</p>
<p><em>Designate one person to be the family representative.</em>  For their
Colorado reunion, Jill Faskin was the contact for the resort and Mary
Beth Solano was the contact for the family. &quot;It eliminated a lot of
confusion,&quot; Solano says.</p>
<p><em>Ask many questions.</em>  Find out what's included in the price (of
course, always negotiate for a special group rate). Learn what
activities are available and make sure they'll be offered when you're
there. See if the resort offers baby-sitting.</p>
<p>Ask if there will be construction going on. Is the beach sandy or
grassy, and does it have a gradual entry or a steep drop-off? Is the
ocean surf too rough for small children?</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_cabins.jpg" alt="Group cabins at Whitewater State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Cabins in state parks, such as these in Minnesota's Whitewater State
Park, make an inexpensive venue for family reunions.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Ask about potential pests.</em> Around the Great Lakes, ask if black flies
will be around when you are. In Florida, ask if the insects known as
no-see-ums are a problem, and whether hurricanes will be a threat at the
time you're considering.</p>
<p><em>Don't be shy.</em>  Forewarned is forearmed. If possible, visit the resort
in advance. There's no substitute for seeing it with your own eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;You have no idea what it's like till you get there,&quot; says Jack
Becker of Minneapolis, Nancy Reynolds' husband. &quot;That's what I like
about the Internet â€” at least there are more visuals than you'd see
in a brochure.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Have a backup plan.</em> Bad weather is always a possibility. Does your
group enjoy board games? If not, make sure family members have access to
indoor activities they like.</p>
<p><em>If necessary, cut costs.</em>  Full-service resorts make reunions
relatively easy, but not every family can afford one. But with careful
planning, everyone still can have a lot of fun, with minimal work.</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas to <em>save money.</em></p>
<p>State parks often have <strong>guesthouses or large cabins</strong>
they rent inexpensively. But these book up
at least a year in advance for weekends, so plan ahead. For more, see
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/groups/group-lodges/">Cabins for a crowd</a> and <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/minnesota-state-park-cabins/">Lodgings in Minnesota state
parks</a>.</p>
<p>Stay at a <strong>ski resort in the summer,</strong>
when condo rates drop by 50 percent. At Colorado's Keystone Resort, for
example, summer brings bicycling, golfing on a Robert Trent Jones Jr.
course, swimming and weekend food and music festivals.</p>
<p>In <strong>winter,</strong>  rates drop at northern
resorts that cater to golfers. And these resorts may be particularly
open to negotiating group rates.</p>
<p>In Florida, resorts along the Gulf Coast and the Atlantic, especially
the small, locally owned ones, drop their rates in <strong>summer and fall.</strong>
But remember, late fall is hurricane
season.</p>
<p>Check out small, ma-and-pa lake resorts in Minnesota, Wisconsin and the
Upper Peninsula of Michigan. At many such gems, a <strong>housekeeping cabin</strong>
with the basics â€” beach,
playground, lodge with gameroom â€” costs only $2,000 per week.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/plan/reservations/choosing-lake-resort/">One in
1,000</a>.</p>
<p>Plan to hold your reunion <strong>midweek,</strong>  when
rates usually are cheapest, or during the slow months of <strong>November and
April.</strong></p>
