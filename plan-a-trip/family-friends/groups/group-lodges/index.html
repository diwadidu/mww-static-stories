Two rustic cabins on Lake Michigan in Wisconsin's Point Beach State

<p>Contrary to common wisdom, the best deals in travel aren't too good to
be true.</p>
<p>The key is to travel with a group. Gather 20 people, and you can bring
per-person costs way, way down — we're talking $20, $10, even $5
for an overnight stay.</p>
<p>Where? State-park lodges, environmental-learning centers, church
retreats and youth camps.</p>
<p>Those are perfect for outdoors clubs, hobby retreats or family
reunions.</p>
<p>You can also use your group's buying power to get a nicer place than
you could afford on your own, such as a luxury vacation rental or an
entire mom-and-pop motel.</p>
<p>One fall, I paid $6.50 per night to go to southeast Minnesota's
Whitewater State Park with my outdoors group.</p>
<p>Our heated cabins sat in a bowl, surrounded by 200-foot-high cliffs, and
when we wanted to hike on 10 miles of trails, we just walked out the
door. We had our own shower house and our own lodge, with a wood-burning
fireplace and a big kitchen with walk-in cooler.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The hiking was spectacular, with climbs to craggy blufftops that gave us
panoramic views of fall color.</p>
<p>Whitewater is even more in demand in spring, when fly fishermen line its
river and morel-mushroom hunters comb its hillsides. In summer, campers
come for relief from mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Stay there, and you're really in the catbird's seat. The trick is to
beat out everyone else who wants to stay there.</p>
<p>&quot;You have to get on the horn at 8 in the morning, and usually there are
two or three people calling at the same time,&quot; says park manager
Garry Barvels.</p>
<p>If we'd had a few more people, we would have paid only $5 per night.
That's the per-person rate, but the minimum was $130 when we were
there. In high season, from April 16 to Oct. 14, it's $360.</p>
<p>There are group centers in other Minnesota state parks, too. Sibley
State Park, in the lakes country of Kandiyohi County, is one of the
state's most popular parks.</p>
<p>Its group center has 11 buildings, with its own dining hall, shower
building, volleyball court and gathering spot for campfires.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/h/whitewater_cabins.jpg" alt="Group cabins at Whitewater State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Groups who stay in the cabins in Minnesota's Whitewater State Park also
get to use a large lodge with a wood-burning fireplace and commercial
kitchen.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Some people just rent the staff quarters, which has four bedrooms and
three baths, says office manager Dede Johnson, but many spread out.</p>
<p>&quot;We see a lot of family reunions,&quot; she says. &quot;A lot of families have
been doing this for years, and they keep expanding and growing and
growing.</p>
<p>&quot;And last year, we had a wedding, and many family members just stayed.
We have a big, beautiful dining area with lots of picnic tables, and
they decorated it.&quot;</p>
<p>Lodgings in state-parks, hostels and retreat centers aren't luxurious,
but they're a bargain. They also solve many of the problems encountered
when planning for a group.</p>
<p>Everyone can afford to stay there, and the single bunk beds suit people
who aren't related to each other. They have large commons areas where
people can congregate over coffee or wine.</p>
<p>If you don't have a group or you don't belong to a club, join one. For
more about travel with outdoors groups, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/groups/club-travel/">Join the
club</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, you need to <em>bring bedding and towels</em> and clean the place
before you leave. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/cabin-packing-list/">What to bring to a rented
cabin</a>.</p>
<p>Below are some of the best places I've found to take a group in
Minnesota and Wisconsin.</p>
