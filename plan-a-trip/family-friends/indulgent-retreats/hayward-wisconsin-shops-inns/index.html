<h2>For guests, the comforts of this northwoods Wisconsin town belie its reputation.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/a/hayward_west_dairy.jpg" alt="Eating ice cream at West Dairy in Hayward." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Tourists and locals alike gravitate to West's Dairy for ice cream.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>From the beginning, Hayward has been a rough town.</p>
<p>It sprang up in Wisconsin's north woods along with the logging camps,
and its saloons and brothels gave it a reputation that was reflected in
a rail conductor's call: &quot;All aboard for Hayward, Hurley and Hell!&quot;</p>
<p>After resorts replaced logging camps, muskie wranglers joined
lumberjacks as mythic figures.</p>
<p>The fishing feats are enshrined at the National Fresh Water Fishing Hall
of Fame, home of a 143-foot fiberglass muskie, but the lumberjacks —
many of them graduates of the Hayward Log Rolling School — still are
chopping, sawing and birling for tourists at the Lumberjack Bowl.</p>
<p>Whether they're wrestling a 60-pound muskie out of the water or
twirling a 12-inch log under their feet, these are tough folks.</p>
<p>Add the anglers and birlers to the skiers who pour in to race in the 
51-kilometer American Birkebeiner and the mountain bikers who race 40
miles in the Chequamegon Fat Tire Festival, and you see Hayward is a hub
for the robust.</p>
<p>These robust types, however, are not rubes. These days, it's easier to
find French roast around downtown Hayward than football and Miller Lite.</p>
<p>&quot;It's changing; it's gone from being a blue-collar resort town to a
really sophisticated place,&quot; says Molly Otis, a musician and artist who
also raised a champion lumberjack.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Today, visitors to Hayward can hang out on the lakes and forests, as
always. But now they also can browse in an impressive collection of
shops, go to wine tastings and sample locally made microbrews.</p>
<p>For them, Hayward has gone from hell to heaven, in just one century.</p>
<h3>Comforts of home</h3>
<p>Otis is one of the people who have been spiffing up Hayward's downtown.</p>
<p>In 2000, after the breakup of her alt-country band, Molly and the
Heymakers, she renovated a century-old brick building just off Main
Street's covered boardwalk and opened a chic shop called the Pavilion.</p>
<p>Then she renovated the basement and opened the Wine Cave. We found her
there one Saturday, wearing pearls and a long brocade coat, handing out
samples of Belgian beer and desserts left over from a &quot;club night&quot;
that had drawn 100 people.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/h/a/hayward_giant_muskie.jpg" alt="The giant muskie at the Hayward Fishing Museum." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Everyone wants to see Hayward's giant muskie, whose toothy mouth is a
favorite spot for weddings.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;That a wine cave is making it here in Hayward, that means a lot, and
we've hardly advertised,&quot; she said. &quot;There are a bunch of people
making their own way here and doing it in their own style.&quot;</p>
<p>The many local painters, photographers, sculptors and potters sell their
work at Art Beat and other local shops. Artists tend to gravitate to
Hayward, but so do people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Ray Bartlett was operating an RV park in Arizona when he first came to
Hayward to visit some of his favorite customers.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to get out of Arizona, and I thought, 'Wow, this is a neat
area,' &quot; he said.</p>
<p>He moved to Hayward and started selling prints of old Hayward out of a
turn-of-the-century building on Main Street that has its original
stamped-tin ceiling: framed newspaper clippings of muskie hunter Louis
Spray, souvenir photos of Lindahl's Talking Indian and ads for
cook-shanty meals at Historyland.</p>
<p>But his vintage photographs of logging and hunting camps sell like hot
cakes, especially to the out-of-towners who are replacing Hayward's
mom-and-pop resorts with million-dollar vacation homes.</p>
<p>&quot;There are no mansions here, there are 'cabins,' &quot; Bartlett says
dryly. &quot;They're mansion cabins.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Many of the old-timers who drop by, Bartlett says, bemoan the
disappearance of old Hayward. But it's newcomers who have rescued and
revitalized the town's oldest and best-known landmarks.</p>
