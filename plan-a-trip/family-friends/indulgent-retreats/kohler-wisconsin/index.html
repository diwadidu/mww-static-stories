<h2>In a tidy Wisconsin town, a family's reach stretches far beyond plumbing fixtures.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/o/kohler_american_club2.jpg" alt="The American Club in Kohler." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The five-star American Club once was a dormitory for workers.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It all began with an enameled horse trough/hog scalder.</p>
<p>It grew into an empire that includes a five-diamond resort, a collection
of upscale shops, an innovative art center, a foundation that rescues
Wisconsin folk art and, in fact, an entire town that's so perfect it's
almost eerie.</p>
<p>That horse trough evolved, too, into such products as the Body Spa, a
futuristic shower stall with a waterfall and 10 jets that pummel tired
muscles with 80 gallons of water per minute.</p>
<p>What a long, strange trip it's been for Kohler, Wis.</p>
<p>In 1873, Austrian immigrant John Michael Kohler took over an iron and
steel farm-implement foundry in Sheboygan, on the Wisconsin shore of
Lake Michigan. Ten years later, he enameled a cast-iron horse trough,
found that it made a good bathtub, and entered the plumbing business.</p>
<p>But he loved the open countryside, and at the turn of the century, he
built a plant four miles away. It was dubbed Kohler's Folly in
Sheboygan but became the nucleus of a new town.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In 1913, his son Walter toured European towns and eventually hired a
Boston firm to design a planned community to replace the willy-nilly
buildings that had sprung up around the factory.</p>
<p>At its center was a gabled, Tudor-style brick dormitory where workers
could learn English, take citizenship classes and steep themselves in
the American way.</p>
<p>It was called the American Club. Renovated and reopened in 1981 as a
resort hotel, it has followed the trajectory of the horse trough,
vaulting into the upper echelons of society: Now, in the former laundry,
formally dressed diners consume $40 entrees in a restaurant called the
Immigrant Room.</p>
<p>In the old bowling alley, they choose from 54 specialty beers. In the
tiled baths of luxurious rooms whose nightly cost is at least 10 times
the monthly room and board of the original occupants, they soak in
trademark whirlpools.</p>
<p>Today, the American Club is where people go to reap the rewards of the
American way.</p>

<p>I visited Kohler early one November, stopping first at the Kohler Design
Center. Sinks and toilet bowls-one wreathed in peonies, another in
botanical tulips-gleamed under soft track lighting. Marveling at the
prices, I ascended a shrine to whirlpools, each in a glass-block cubby
framed by palms.</p>
<p>I had to laugh at the museumlike presentation-it's just plumbing,
after all. Still, it was a raw day on the other side of those picture
windows, and those whirlpools looked pretty inviting.</p>
<p>I took in the Kohler story in the bottom-level exhibits, which include
products that really do belong in museums: One section was devoted to
the work of artists who are granted six months in the Kohler pottery,
foundry and enamel shops, where they use the facilities and tap employee
expertise.</p>
<p>The Kohlers, it seems, are tycoons with a renaissance bent. Their
philosophy-one of them-is enshrined in the leaded windows of the
Wisconsin Room. It's a quote from the English reformer John Ruskin:
&quot;Life without labor is guilt-labor without art is brutality.&quot;</p>
<p>From the design center, I went to the Shops at Woodlake Kohler, a
handsome collection that is the only place for villagers to shop.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Here, the siren song of materialism called loudly as I walked from one
tasteful storefront to another, followed by piped classical music; if I
had a wad of money to blow, this would be a good place to do it.</p>
<p>Back at the American Club, exhibitors were setting up for a holiday
market in the Great Hall.</p>
<p>I walked on and had a burger in the Horse &amp; Plow, pausing on the way out
to look at a wall lined by framed citizenship applications from one-time
residents of the American Club, each renouncing allegiances to various
kings, czars and emperors.</p>
<p>The next morning, I had the continental breakfast of coffee, freshly
squeezed orange juice, fruit and two tiny croissants-at $14, steep
-in the beautiful Wisconsin Room, then set off to wander among
various wings.</p>
<p>In the courtyards, some genius had been at work, creating magical oases
of tall grasses and trellises, hanging lanterns and stone paths, bronze
cherubs and wooden benches.</p>
<p>Back in the lobby, a platoon of women were preparing to storm the Great
Hall. I talked with Lynn Forsgren of Fremont, Wis., who comes with a
group of women friends every year.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/k/o/kohler_shops.jpg" alt="The Shops at Woodlake in Kohler." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>&quot;We got here last night and all had facials,&quot; she said. &quot;First we
had dinner at the Horse &amp; Plow. We came back to the room and relaxed,
had breakfast in the Wisconsin Room, and now we're going to the show.
Here in Wisconsin it's hunting season, so it works out real well.&quot;</p>
<p>I browsed through the show and then went for a run in the woods around
the Sports Core, an indoor spa and sports complex around Wood Lake.</p>
<p>Before I left Kohler, I explored it a bit more, from the factory right
across from the American Club, shielded by a row of maples, to winding
streets lined with pretty cottages and the wooded ridges and ravines of
Blackwolf Run golf course. Not a leaf was out of place.</p>
<p>Despite its disconcerting perfection, or perhaps because of it, the
American Club makes quite a getaway. It's not for everybody-for one
thing, most people can't afford it.</p>
<p>But if you've made it, and you don't need to quibble about cost, give
it a try. It's the American way.</p>
