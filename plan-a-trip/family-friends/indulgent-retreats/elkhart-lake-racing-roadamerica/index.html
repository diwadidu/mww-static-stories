<h2>In this eastern Wisconsin resort town, unleash your inner speed demon.</h2>

<p>Thanks to the last glacier, Elkhart Lake is amply endowed with curves
-just the kind of curves a race-car driver appreciates.</p>
<p>In 1949, the old lake-resort town was struggling. Then millionaire
sportsman Jim Kimberly, scion of the Kimberly-Clark paper fortune in
Neenah, began looking for a local place to race his cars.</p>
<p>He and three buddies, including Fred Wacker of the prominent Chicago
family, chartered a plane and circled the forested kettle moraine west
of Sheboygan. They found exactly what they were looking for in the
undulating curves and swells of the roads around Elkhart Lake.</p>
<p>They're asphalt ribbons draped over piles of glacial rubble, creating a
roller coaster for drivers-and a set of hard turns that tested, and
sometimes bested, their skill.</p>
<p>The first race in 1950 drew 5,000 spectators, and Elkhart Lake knew it
had a winner.</p>
<p>&quot;The town was looking for a way to revive tourism after the war, and
this kind of fell into their hands,&quot; says John Calhoun, president of
Historic Race Circuits of Elkhart Lake.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Races also were held in 1951 and 1952. Then, during a race in upstate
New York, Fred Wacker's Allard clipped a group of spectators, killing a
7-year-old boy. That was the end of racing on public roads in America.</p>
<p>But racing returned to Elkhart Lake in 1955, when the Road America
course was built. And now anyone can get a taste of speed.</p>
<p>Built on farmland that was even hillier than the original course, the
wooded, 640-acre complex-it calls itself the &quot;National Park of
Speed&quot;-includes a four-mile race course with 14 turns and 160
feet of elevation change.</p>
<p>There's a grandstand, but spectators can watch from any spot, getting
around by foot, bicycle or golf cart. When there isn't a race, they can
cruise on the course themselves, either fast, with a professional driver
in a pace car, or slowly, in their own cars.</p>
<p>Road America also has an .8-mile go-kart course that's built into a
hillside and has more than 50 feet of elevation change-call it the
anti-oval.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/elkhart_lake_jeff.jpg" alt="A teacher on the driving course." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Teacher Jeff Huber explains the physics of braking during skid-control
practice.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>This isn't your kids' karting. If you think you're not interested in
the sport of racing, just try it. But be careful-many of today's
professional race-car drivers got hooked on this very course.</p>
<p>I got to drive it during a media tour. But before we students could go
fast, we had to learn how to stop fast, by practicing maneuvers taught
in Road America's driving schools.</p>
<p>We practiced threshold braking with each other in the car, but to learn
skid control, we rode with instructor Jeff Huber, who teaches teen
drivers and jokes, &quot;I'm addicted to danger.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a completely alien act to gun a car to 25 mph and keep your foot
<em>off</em> the brake as you career around a
half-moon of cones, and Huber had to keep shouting, &quot;Give it gas!&quot;
and &quot;Foot to the floor!&quot; But once we decided we weren't going to
die, we followed orders.</p>
<p>Then we had to control the resulting spin, which was terrifying. Fail,
and you do a 360. But if you keep your eyes trained on where you want to
go and your hands moving fast on the steering wheel, you'll shimmy to a
stop right in front of the goal, a green cone.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;Whew, that was a rush,&quot; said another student. &quot;I feel giddy.&quot;</p>
<p>On the way to the slalom course, we got to cruise the four-mile race
track, and I was lucky to ride along with instructor Duck Waddle, who's
been racing on it since 1959 and knows the twists of the course better
than anyone.</p>
<p>He drove it as gracefully as an ice skater, hugging the inside of
curves, then floating to the outside, always aiming for the white line
that separates the track from the rumble strips.</p>
<p>&quot;The straighter you can keep the car, the faster you can go,&quot; he
said. &quot;On this track, you try to go a second faster each lap; if you try
to gain two seconds, you crash.&quot;</p>
<p>Again, the key was to keep your eyes focused on where you want to go.</p>
<p>&quot;The farther ahead you look, the slower things come at you,&quot; Waddle
said. &quot;On the last stretch, you aim for the scoreboard.&quot;</p>
<p>An 8-foot wire fence lines the course to keep out deer; in 2006, one ran
in front of a Brazilian racer, who hit it and then was hit when the deer
flew into his cockpit (the racer survived).</p>
<p>&quot;The fence also keeps cars from bouncing out,&quot; Waddle said.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/elkhart_lake_start.jpg" alt="The start/finish of the old race circuit." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The start and finish of the old race circuit is in downtown Elkhart
Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>On the slalom course, we gunned a Chevy Cruze and a VW GTI as fast as we
could around a series of swerves and hard turns. Then we tried to drive
the &quot;champagne slalom&quot; the same way except smoother, since a tennis
ball was rolling around a frisbee affixed to our hoods.</p>
<p>When our timidity had worn off and we were used to roaring engines and
squealing brakes, we headed for the karting course, where a new set of
beaming, sunburned instructors awaited us.</p>
<p>&quot;The greater the radius, the greater the speed,&quot; said track assistant
Don Taft. Waddle said it better: &quot;Outside, inside, outside.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let the kart go; you don't want to fight it,&quot; Huber said. &quot;Brake
when you're on the straightaway, then accelerate into the curve. And
remember to breathe.&quot;</p>
<p>We put on giant full-face helmets and climbed into our stripped-down hot
rods, fuel tanks between our knees and feet on steel bars-one for
brakes, one for gas. Huber led at a sedate pace, then took off on the
&quot;F&quot; shaped, half-mile course, disappearing in an instant.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>That's when I discovered my inner speed demon, because I took off, too,
cornering like Waddle had told me to and flooring it on the straightaway
to as close to 45 mph as I could get.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, I lapped two drivers, then another two, and I kept going
until Huber zoomed up on my left before the final lap, raised his hand
to signal &quot;I'm slower&quot; (right!), then let me zip into the pit in the
first position.</p>
<p>I was competing more with myself than the others, trying to figure out
how to shave seconds and literally cut corners, but at the finish, the
others looked at me strangely.</p>
<p>&quot;You!&quot; sputtered one of them. &quot;Did you see me spin out behind you and
into the grass?&quot;</p>
<p>Umm, no-the big helmets allow almost no peripheral vision. &quot;Were you
scared?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p>He looked at me. &quot;Well, I didn't feel good watching your bumper
disappearing around the bend.&quot;</p>
<p>We weren't the first to find that racing is pure exhilaration. The
instructors seemed to be having the times of their lives, too.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on the weekend, when it's really rocking,&quot; Huber said. &quot;The
party never stops.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/l/elkhart_lake_jim.jpg" alt="A teacher checks a slalom time." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>There are three vintage-car and two motorcycle race weekends, a weekend
apiece for NASCAR and the American Le Mans series and two for the Sports
Car Club of America.</p>
<p>You can spend all day and night at Road America, which has camping and
food concessions on race weekends, or you can spend time in Elkhart
Lake, which is on the shores of Wisconsin's fourth-deepest natural lake
and has been a resort town since the 1860s.</p>
<p>It started as a destination for wealthy families from Chicago, but by
the 1920s, every resort had a casino, and prostitution was common.
Gambling was stopped in 1945, and by the late 1940s, the three grand
resorts on the north end of the lake were fading.</p>
<p>&quot;Racing kicked off the revival of Elkhart Lake as a resort
destination,&quot; John Calhoun said. &quot;It really became a more wholesome
place after that.&quot;</p>
<p>The old 6Â½-mile race circuit still is there, with plaques that mark such
landmarks as Brigg's Bend, where racer Steven Briggs lost control of
his Jaguar, and Dickens' Ditch, where Ted Boynton flew into a patch of
blueberries and poison ivy.</p>

<p>Noting an electronic speed indicator on the course, I asked Calhoun if
people are tempted to speed on it.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I can speak from personal experience-people <em>are</em>
still tempted,&quot; he said with a smile.
&quot;They're fun roads to drive.&quot;</p>
