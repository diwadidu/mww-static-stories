<h2>On a cold-weather getaway, friends indulge in chocolate, craft beer and massages.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_fitgers_fall.jpg" alt="Fitger's brewery complex in Duluth." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The old Fitger's brewery now houses shops, restaurants, a brewpub and a day spa.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In summer and fall, festive Canal Park draws the crowds. But when cold
winds blow in winter, a brewery suddenly looks much better.</p>
<p>Started in 1882 as Fink's Lake Superior Brewery, Fitger's was a
mainstay in Duluth, surviving Prohibition but not industry
consolidation. It closed in 1972 and almost was razed, but the
sprawling building on the lake reopened in 1984 as a hotel, restaurant
and shopping complex.</p>
<p>Now, the complex also boasts a day spa, a nightclub, a brewery, a
coffeehouse and shops — everything anyone could want for a little
getaway, all under one roof.</p>
<p>My friend Judy and I drove up on a gray Wednesday in November, stopping
first at the Depot for a free antique appraisal.</p>
<p>Appraiser Dan Sershon couldn't muster much interest in the plates Judy
had brought, but when we asked him to tell us the most interesting thing
he'd seen, he looked over our shoulders and said, &quot;That lamp that's
going to come up next.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It was an Arts and Crafts lamp, with acorn finials and a forest scene
painted onto a glass shade that sprang to life when lit.</p>
<p>&quot;These things didn't sell for that much money then, but this
generation is much more interested in them,&quot; he said, estimating a
value of at least $1,500-$2,500.</p>
<p>After stopping to shop on Superior Street, we dropped our bags at
Fitger's. Then we walked down the hall to the Brewhouse and treated
ourselves to a turkey Cobb sandwich and a Greek salad with
zucchini-stuffed phyllo turnovers.</p>
<p>&quot;That was really restorative,&quot; Judy said. &quot;I'm the queen of the
Cobb, and that was one of the best I've had.&quot;</p>
<p>Then we walked downstairs to the day spa, where Judy went off to have a
manicure and pedicure and I eased myself onto a heated massage table,
where a young masseuse began digging the stress out of my shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;Can you feel it crackling in there?&quot; she asked. &quot;It's like
marbles under my fingers.&quot;</p>
<p>Kneading my feet, she said it's true that energy forces connect the
feet to other parts of the body.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_lakewalk_fitgers.jpg" alt="Walking by Fitger's on Duluth's Lakewalk." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;These are the lungs, and you can tell when people smoke because it's
pretty crunchy in there,&quot; she said. &quot;Yeah, it's crazy.&quot;</p>
<p>She gave the kind of no-nonsense massage I like, and after 30 minutes
with her, I wished I'd asked for 60 minutes. Instead, I went to another
nook of the old brewery, where I received a facial that was competent
but lackluster.</p>
<p>Back in the main part of the spa, where a copper vat protrudes from the
ceiling, Judy showed me her newly restored hands.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been stripping things at home, and they were a mess, but now
I'm on the path to righteousness,&quot; she said. &quot;Now I wonder how I
went out of the house like that.&quot;</p>
<p>As Judy soaked her feet, the esthetician overheard me ask about the hand
paraffin wax and jumped up.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to give you one, come on,&quot; she said, leading me to a tub
full of liquid paraffin. She told me to dip my hands four times, then
wrapped them in plastic bags and terrycloth mitts. When they were dry,
she peeled off the soft wax and squirted Aveda Hand Relief into my
palms, leaving the skin as soft as a baby's.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Judy's feet had been softened up, too.</p>
<p>&quot;Now I have happy, happy toes,&quot; she said. &quot;That was an A plus
pedicure. It was so worth it.&quot;</p>
<p>She left the spa in flip-flops, to let her toenail polish harden, and we
wandered through the nearby shops — the Bookstore, which sells
Fitger's pint glasses and T-shirts; the Snow Goose, a gift shop and
sole survivor of the shops that opened in 1984; and TrailFitters, which
caters to outdoorsy types.</p>
<p>The Boat Club is the place to go for fine dining, but the Brewhouse is
such a convivial place we couldn't resist returning there for dinner.
Lake Superior Brewing Co. made Fitger's a real brewery again in 1994,
but it outgrew the building and moved; now, the Brewhouse serves its own
lagers, stouts and IPAs.</p>
<p>We sampled them in 10-ounce glasses and ate a mushroom-Swiss burger and
fish and chips. After a while, musician Charlie Parr arrived and began
playing a lively brand of blues.</p>
<p>For a Wednesday in November, there was a lot going on. Across the hall,
novice salsa dancers were getting lessons at the Barrel Room, a sliver
of a room that makes up for its size with its sleek design.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/u/duluth_boats_anchored.jpg" alt="Boats anchored off Canal Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In fall, salties wait on Lake Superior for their turn to load grain in
the harbor.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The next morning was mild, so we nabbed some pastries from Fitger's
continental buffet and went strolling along the Lakewalk to Canal Park.</p>
<p>Over lunch at the Boat Club, we watched the arrival of the Canadian
freighter Olympic from the picture window next to our table.</p>
<p>Our last stop was DeWitt-Seitz Marketplace, where we bought chocolate
ore boats and chocolate-almond toffee at Hepzibah's.</p>
<p>It's almost too easy to indulge yourself in Duluth. Learning how to age
gracefully with beer and chocolate — now there's a concept that could
take off.</p>
