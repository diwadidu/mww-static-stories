<h2>There's skiing, dining and sightseeing right in this modest paper town.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/i/ninemile_snowshoeing.jpg" alt="Snowshoeing in Nine Mile Forest." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Travel Wisconsin</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Nine Mile Forest is a good place to ski and also to snowshoe.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The first time I saw Rib Mountain it was nighttime, and I was driving
toward Wausau from the north.</p>
<p>Looming over the Wisconsin town was a massive hulk lined with white
lights, rising from the surrounding plain like a landing strip set on
edge. It was a spectacular sight — and still is, day or night.</p>
<p>This billion-year-old quartzite ridge, one of the oldest on Earth, was
thought to be the highest point in Wisconsin until Timm's Hill, near
Ogema, was surveyed at 12 feet higher.</p>
<p>Timm's Hill, however, blends in with its northwoods landscape; Rib
Mountain sticks out like a mile-wide rib cage.</p>
<p>It's the perfect spot for an alpine ski area, and there's been one on
the mountain's north face since 1937. The top and south face is Rib
Mountain State Park, and the Wisconsin DNR owns them both.</p>
<p>It leases the ski area, however, to Charles Skinner Jr., who has
invested millions to upgrade the ski hill, Granite Peak.</p>
<p>It makes sense. It's easy to get to Wausau — it's all interstate or
four-lane highway from Madison, Milwaukee, Chicago and the Twin Cities</p>
<ul>
<li>and the mountain has a 700-foot vertical drop, the highest in
Wisconsin and Michigan.</li>
</ul>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The town at its feet supplies nearly 2,000 hotel rooms, many modestly
priced, as well as restaurants, movie theaters and malls. There's even
a highly regarded museum and a beautifully renovated opera house, which
hosts Broadway shows on tour.</p>
<p>The town is on the edge of the northern Wisconsin snowbelt and usually
has plenty of snow for snowshoeing in the state park and cross-country
skiing at Nine Mile Forest, one of the region's best Nordic skiing
destinations.</p>
<p>In fact, Wausau's parks, slopes, trails and ice rinks are used every
year for the Badger State Winter Games, Wisconsin's big amateur sports
festival, and the town has used the slogan &quot;This is as Up North as you
need to be!&quot;</p>
<p>From the Twin Cities, Wausau is an easy 2¾-hour drive, making it farther
than Duluth's Spirit Mountain but closer than Giants Ridge, Lutsen and
the four ski slopes around Ironwood.</p>
<p>I skied at Granite Peak one holiday weekend with my children, and easy
was the word. We found parking spots right next to the entrance and
cruised up to the chairlifts, no waiting despite the holiday.</p>
<p>We found a special at the Super 8, which is five minutes from Granite
Peak and has an indoor pool and whirlpool.</p>
<p>When we wanted to sightsee in town, we followed the blue &quot;Art Museum&quot;
signs through downtown and the historic district to the Leigh Yawkey
Woodson Art Museum, Wausau's pride and joy.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/a/wausau_winter_sculpture.jpg" alt="The sculptures of Leigh Yawkey Woodson art museum in Wausau" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The sculpture garden of Leigh Yawkey Woodson Art Museum is interesting
in all seasons.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Leigh Yawkey, the only child of lumber baron Cyrus Yawkey, loved
beautiful things. The museum's gabled brick home overlooking Wausau was
donated by one of her daughters, and the sculpture gallery on its
picturesque grounds is named for another.</p>
<p>Admission is free, and it's child-friendly; besides the sculptures, my
children especially liked an exhibit about &quot;Mr. Imagination,&quot; a folk
artist from Chicago.</p>
<p>Another weekend, my friend Becky and I skied cross-country at Nine Mile
County Forest, home of the Badger State cross-country competition. We
bought passes in the roomy chalet and headed out on perfectly groomed
trails.</p>
<p>From a wide avenue lined with Christmas-tree firs, we entered a thick
grove of towering pines, their upper branches holding so much snow they
mirrored the forest floor.</p>
<p>Skate-skiers whipped by us as we strode along into hardwood forest and
onto the Bushwhacker Trail, which included a long, leisurely downhill
run.</p>
<p>Back at the chalet, we relaxed near the wood stove, looking out through
big picture windows. Becky had skied there before with her family and
some friends and reported that it, too, is child-friendly.</p>
<p>&quot;When we were here with the kids, we took over a table and spread out
coloring books and games,&quot; Becky said. &quot;It was great. We had shifts,
and when it was my turn, I took the kids out back sliding.&quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Skiing in Wausau is even better now. Granite Peak has expanded and has a
terrain park and 74 runs served by seven chairlifts, one high-speed.</p>
<p>Its Sundance Chalet &amp; Grill and Bears Den Saloon &amp; Tavern offer live
music on Saturdays. Its restored 1938 stone mountain chalet has a coffee
bar.</p>
<p>Wausau, population 38,000, still is a quiet town. But for people looking
for a relaxing getaway from the big city, that's not a bad thing.</p>
