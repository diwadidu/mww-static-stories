Rivers run through it, the Turtle and the Flambeau. They were dammed to create a flowage in 1926, and today it's a state scenic waters area, designated for boating, fishing and camping. Hundreds of islands and secluded bays provide habitat for bald eagles, osprey and loons, who outnumber the paddlers who pull up to rustic campsites.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/turtle-flambeau-mercer-wisconsin/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/whitewater-kayaking-101/">Whitewater 101</a></h2><h3>In Wisconsin, novice kayakers learn the moves at Bear Paw Outdoor Adventure Resort.</h3><p>Whitewater paddlers are, by definition, thrill-seekers. That's why they seek out the northeast corner of Wisconsin, "the cradle of rivers.'' The big Wisconsin River starts there, as do the Wolf, Peshtigo and Menominee, three of the Upper Midwest's best-known whitewater rivers. On the Wolf River, Bear Paw Outdoor Adventure Resort has been a whitewater hub since 1994, selling gear to expert wranglers and teaching novices how to handle the rapids that churn over knots of boulders dropped by the last glacier.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/whitewater-kayaking-101/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/wausau-wisconsin-whitewater-paddling/">Wausau's liquid assets</a></h2><h3>In this sporty town on the Wisconsin River, just go with the flow.</h3><p>In Wausau, water is power. Sawmills were first to use the thundering rapids along the Wisconsin River, which have been working hard ever since. But these rapids generate more than the electricity that lights a bulb &mdash; they also draw world-class athletes for thrilling tournaments, such the 2012 world whitewater kayak/canoe championships for juniors and under-23 paddlers, some of them Olympics-bound.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/wausau-wisconsin-whitewater-paddling/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/best-snowshoe-trails-wisconsin/">Snowshoeing in Wisconsin</a></h2><h3>National forests, state parks and wildlife preserves roll out the white carpet in Wisconsin.</h3><p>On the week before Christmas, I figured I'd found the prettiest place in the world.

Only when temperatures stay low for a long time will the edges of Lake Superior freeze enough for people to walk out to the mainland ice caves, whose beauty is renowned.  Even when ice is sufficiently solid, wind may suddenly split it, and snow may block the access drive.

In early June, rates can be almost ludicrously low, cheaper than a Super 8. And even on weekends in July and August, it's not hard to find a decent place for $100 or less if you book in advance. The Door Peninsula's breezy beaches are the place to be when the rest of the region is sweltering. During one early June heat wave, temperatures there were 20 to  40 degrees lower, and lodging rates were low, too &mdash; I got three nights for the price of two.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/best-motels-resorts-door-county/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-wisconsin/winter-wausau/">Winter in Wausau</a></h2><h3>In winter, this modest paper town offers skiing, dining and sightseeing.</h3><p>The first time I saw Rib Mountain it was nighttime, and I was driving toward Wausau from the north.

Whatever it comes from &mdash; the burnished logs hewed by ax, the hearths made of stones picked from local fields, the faint fragrance of aged pine and cedar &mdash; it can't be ordered from the local furniture store. Once, the north woods of Wisconsin were full of lodges. The first were built as fishing camps, after loggers left in the 1890s, and guests were affluent sportsmen who arrived by rail.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/Wisconsin-historic-lodges/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/skiing-telemark-resort-cable/">Telemark's next act</a></h2><h3>For years, a legendary ski resort in northwest Wisconsin tried to claw its way back.</h3><p>What becomes a legend most? In the case of Telemark Resort in northwest Wisconsin, a new life without the old lodge. The once-busy ski lodge closed in 1998, reopened in 1999, closed again in 2010 and reopened in January 2011. It closed once more in 2013 and was sold at auction. The new owners never had the money to revitalize the property and, in 2017, planned to sell it to a hotel-management company that would modernize and reopen the resort as a year-round vacation destination.

Operating in the Red Cedar River valley, it was for a time the largest in the world, and Menomonie was the company town. The heirs gave it schools, churches, an auditorium; James Stout, son of the president, endowed the institute that became the University of Wisconsin-Stout.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/stouts-lodge-wisconsin/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/fish-creek-door-county/">Fish Creek in Door County</a></h2><h3>In this historic resort town, crowds come for the shops and the scenery. </h3><p>It's known as Door County's shopping town, and if people think that's too much of a good thing &mdash; well, they're in the minority, judging by throngs on the streets. It's also the gateway to the wildly popular Peninsula State Park.
