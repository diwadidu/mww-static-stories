But those are not the waters for which it's named. Those waters belong to a river whose cloudiness led the Dakota to call it "waters reflecting the skies" &mdash; the Minnesota.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/minnesota-river/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/whitewater-state-park-minnesota/">Minnesota's spring mecca</a></h2><h3>In southeast Minnesota, Whitewater is the go-to park for fly fishermen, morel hunters and wildflower watchers.</h3><p>In May, there's no better place to be than a park in the bluffs of southeast Minnesota. Of course, May is beautiful everywhere. But Whitewater State Park has the best array of spring wildflowers, the best morel-mushroom hunting  and the best trout fishing &mdash; or if it's not the best, at least there's none better. "I wish we could have a year of Mays,'' longtime naturalist Dave Palmquist likes to say.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/whitewater-state-park-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/fun-in-rochester-minnesota/">Rah Rah Rochester</a></h2><h3>The quiet medical giant may be sterile, but it's also engaging.</h3><p>In Rochester, a tourist from the Twin Cities is a novelty. Tourists from anywhere are a novelty, though patients and medical professionals come from around the world.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/fun-in-rochester-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/theater-music/music-mississippi-valley-minnesota/">Music on the Mississippi</a></h2><h3>Along the Mississippi River in southeast Minnesota, an unusual medley of rural and small-town venues draws delighted audiences.</h3><p>In southeast Minnesota, along the Mississippi and in its bluffs, folk and roots music has found a home far from the bright lights of the big city.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/theater-music/music-mississippi-valley-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/pipestone-quarries-minnesota/">Pipestone pilgrimage</a></h2><h3>For centuries, the quarries have been a sacred spot in this southwest Minnesota town.</h3><p>It's easy to see why the Plains Indians saw the Great Spirit at work in a far corner of Minnesota. Amid an ocean of tall grass, a fractured pile of hard red rock suddenly erupts from the sod. It's Sioux quartzite, once sand at the edge of a red ocean, cooked and pressed into marble-like stone over a billion years.  Beneath the quartzite is a thin seam of a softer stone, a red, hardened clay that's barely harder than a fingernail.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/pipestone-quarries-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/jeffers-petroglyphs/">Written in stone</a></h2><h3>The ancient carvings at Jeffers tell a dramatic but mysterious story.</h3><p>In the middle of farm fields, on a slab of the same Sioux quartzite that pops out of the sod farther west at Pipestone and Blue Mound, the story of an ancient people is written with nearly 2,000 characters. They're dramatic characters - serpents of the underworld, and thunderbirds who shoot lightening bolts from their eyes.  There are buffalos and stick figures and atlatls, a spear-throwing device, but no bow and arrows, which began to replace the atlatl 1,000 years ago.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/jeffers-petroglyphs/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/pipestone-road-trip/">Road trip: Southwest Minnesota</a></h2><h3>In the middle of the prairie, blood-red rock splits the sod, holding meaning far beyond the picturesque.</h3><p>In the southwest corner of the state, the prairie hardly looks like typical Minnesota vacation land. Instead of lakes, fractured red quartzite erupts from the earth, and wind towers pop up on the horizon like giant black daisies. Herds of bison graze in fields, and yellow blooms cover prickly pear cactus. This was the spiritual center of the universe for indigenous people on the prairie, and it exerts a pull on others, too.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/pipestone-road-trip/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/upper-sioux-wacipi/">Dancing on the Yellow Medicine</a></h2><h3>In a history-filled valley, a wacipi celebrates Dakota culture.</h3><p>For many people, the Minnesota River Valley is full of shadows.  But on the first weekend of August, people of indigenous and European descent alike come to Upper Sioux Agency State Park to have a good time. At a wacipi, or powwow, the tradition of welcoming outsiders has held steady for many generations.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/upper-sioux-wacipi/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/spring-grove/">In the land of Norwegians</a></h2><h3>Old World traditions come with a wink in the bluff-country burg of Spring Grove.</h3><p>At first, the southeast Minnesota town of Spring Grove looks like any other town. There's a caf&eacute;, an antiques store and a park full of statues. But Spring Grove isn't ordinary. It's full of Norwegians. In the park, two bronze men appear to be squabbling; they're characters in a nationally syndicated comic strip written by a Spring Grove man 50 years before Neil Simon came up with "The Odd Couple."</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/spring-grove/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-ulm-german-heritage/">Where the Germans are</a></h2><h3>In southern Minnesota, New Ulm hangs on to a colorful heritage.</h3><p>There are few towns more conspicuously American than New Ulm, Minn. Laid out by the town founders, its wide streets follow an orderly grid toward downtown, where cars park at an angle in front of boxy brick businesses and meat-and-potatoes cafes. There are softball games and Friday-night fish fries and many friendly people. It's the epitome of small-town America &mdash; and yet this is a town famous for being German.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-ulm-german-heritage/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/dakota-war-1862-minnesota/">Mourning the summer of 1862</a></h2><h3>150 years after a tragic conflict, a pilgrimage to the Minnesota River Valley yields facts but few answers.</h3><p>In 1858, as Europe creaked under the weight of its impoverished masses, Minnesota was a place of opportunity. It had plenty of land, and newcomers who worked hard could gain social standing as well as property, an impossibility in the old country. So the poor surged in, thankful for a future. "When I consider my children, I think their futures will be very good, yes, much better than if I had stayed in Norway,'' my great-great-grandfather Rolf wrote home after his arrival in 1862.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/dakota-war-1862-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/madelia-jesse-james/">Posse on the prairie</a></h2><h3>In the southwest Minnesota town of Madelia, the Jesse James Gang met its match &mdash; again.</h3><p>In September 1876, a vicious gang of outlaws came up against some ordinary Minnesotans. The outlaws came out on the short end. Twice. The Civil War ended more than a decade before the James-Younger Gang rode into Minnesota. But it was far from over in Missouri, devastated by guerrilla warfare and still simmering with resentment.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/madelia-jesse-james/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/sod-house/">Little sod house on the prairie</a></h2><h3>A re-created pioneer home shows that life on the frontier wasn't quite as romantic as we think it was.</h3><p>Sometimes, it comes as a shock to tourists, especially those who grew up watching the TV show "Little House on the Prairie,'' that life on the frontier wasn't all that fun. Twenty miles east of Walnut Grove, the late Stan McCone always told it as it was. A farmer, he'd heard stories about the early sod houses. None remained, so he decided to build one of his own, using an old sod cutter. "There were 13 sod houses in this neighborhood, and those are just the ones we know about,'' he said. "But with all those, there's zero recollection of them, and I know why &mdash; because of all the buried children alongside them. They had such hardship.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/sod-house/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/">Feisty Northfield</a></h2><h3>As outlaws discovered, this Minnesota college town is small but rarely sleepy.</h3><p>Northfield always has been shaped by newcomers.  First the Yankees came to town, then the Norwegians. Each started a college, and the Yankees built mills, whose flour won international prizes as the Minneapolis mill were just getting started. Missourians arrived in 1876 for a brief but memorable visit; the violent bank raid by the James-Younger Gang is called "the seven minutes that shook Northfield.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/northfield-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/historic-forestville/">Brigadoon in bluff country</a></h2><h3>At Historic Forestville, visitors are transported back to 1899.</h3><p>In Minnesota, people value their own history so much that the Minnesota Historical Society was founded nine years before the state itself. No wonder the state's living-history sites are among the best in the nation.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/historic-forestville/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/wanda-gag-house/">The artistic Gags of New Ulm</a></h2><h3>The author/illustrator of the children's book</h3><p>New Ulm hasn't always understood the kind of people who color outside the lines. That describes the entire family of Anton G&aacute;g, a German-Bohemian artist whose work can be seen at New Ulm's Cathedral of the Holy Trinity and the brewery of August Schell, who was his patron and sent him to art school in Chicago for six months. All seven children were creative, spending their days drawing, telling stories and building sets for plays.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/wanda-gag-house/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ingalls-wilder/wilder-pageants/">Little pageants on the prairie</a></h2><h3>A scrappy pioneer family is brought to life each year in two towns that played a prominent role in the life of Laura Ingalls Wilder.</h3><p>It's morning in the Little Town on the Prairie, and we're thumbing through the guest book at the Prairie House Manor B&B. "I can't believe we are in the 'Little Town' where Laura grew up,'' one woman wrote. "This is truly a dream come true,'' wrote another. So many little girls, so many dreams. When Laura Ingalls Wilder wrote her nine books about growing up on the American frontier of the 1870s and 1880s, she had no idea her idealized portrait of pioneer life would be such powerful medicine to so many.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ingalls-wilder/wilder-pageants/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/environmental-center/eagle-bluff-ELC/">Escape to Eagle Bluff</a></h2><h3>A center near Lanesboro welcomes families for weekends filled with nature and good food.</h3><p>It was a beautiful fall weekend in Lanesboro, and the streets of this picturesque town in Minnesota's bluff country were packed with sightseers and bicycle tourists.  In fall, Lanesboro is the darling of day-trippers and weekenders. My children and I love it, too. They spent 15 minutes with me in the arts center, I spent 15 minutes with them in the Indian crafts shop, and then we went in-line skating on the paved trail, across the trestle bridge and along the limestone bluffs.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/environmental-center/eagle-bluff-ELC/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/environmental-center/minnesota-environmental-learning/">Minnesota's environmental learning centers</a></h2><h3>A weekend at an ELC is fun for all ages, and a bargain to boot.</h3><p>There's more to do than at any luxury resort: yoga, high-ropes courses, climbing walls, ski trails, nature hikes, canoeing, skiing and snowshoeing on wooded campuses that include lakes and trails.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/environmental-center/minnesota-environmental-learning/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/blue-mounds-minnesota/">Drama on the Prairie Coteau</a></h2><h3>The shifting beauty of the prairie has a showcase at this dramatic park.</h3><p>In the land of 10,000 lakes, prairie often is dismissed as, well, dull. But in the farthest corner of Minnesota, a dramatic patch of terrain offers more spectacle than an Imax show.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/blue-mounds-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/minnesota-caves/">Minnesota's cave country</a></h2><h3>In the southeast corner of the state, scratch the surface for a glimpse of splendor.</h3><p>Under the cornstalks of Fillmore County, an unusual sculpture garden sits in shadow. Stalagmite topiaries line walkways, alongside pale-green flowstone as translucent as Chinese jade. Stalactite statuettes dangle in artistic arrays. They're obviously created by a Pollock of rock, a Van Gogh of stone. Yet their genius relies not on the medium &mdash; water, applied one drop at a time &mdash; but on eons worth of time.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/minnesota-caves/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-minnesota/">Bicycling in Minnesota</a></h2><h3>This state's long, paved trails draw eager riders from around the nation.</h3><p>For Minnesota bicyclists, there are two seasons: winter and trail construction.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-root-river-trail/">Bicycling in bluff country</a></h2><h3>In southeast Minnesota, the Root River Trail brings swarms of tourists to scenic villages.</h3><p>It was a sunny day in southeastern Minnesota, and everywhere I looked, there were Babes.  They were the Fat Bottom Girls Cycle Club from Des Moines, also known as Babes on Bikes, and they were having a swell time riding the smooth, scenic trails of the Root River Valley.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-root-river-trail/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">The belle of bluff country</a></h2><h3>In southeast Minnesota, tiny Lanesboro pulls in the tourists. </h3><p>In an isolated bluff-country valley, reached only by small, winding roads, lies one of Minnesota's favorite getaways.  Only 750 people live here, and they can't afford to advertise much, so most visitors come via word of mouth.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/skiing-winona/">Skiing in southeast Minnesota</a></h2><h3>Snowstorms that blanket the southern woods bring skiers with them.</h3><p>Sometimes, skiers have a hard time figuring out Mother Nature. It's supposed to snow across northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, but often, storms have veered to the south instead. It's odd, but what can you do? You have to go with the snow. One year, at the end of February, my friend Becky and I were just about to make the long drive to the snowy Upper Peninsula of Michigan when the southeast Minnesota town of Winona got blanketed with 30 inches.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/skiing-winona/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/little-crow-lakes-minnesota/">Minnesota's Little Crow lakes</a></h2><h3>West of the Twin Cities, the lakes around Sibley State Park make a good beach getaway.</h3><p>It's a radical idea, but here goes: In Minnesota, you can go up to the lake by heading west. These lakes not only are out west, they're less than two hours from the Twin Cities, in a pocket of the state many overlook. "It was a secret to me,'' said Michele Stillinger, a former Twin Citian working as a naturalist at Sibley State Park. "I thought I wouldn't find anything out here; I was very surprised.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/little-crow-lakes-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/best-snowshoe-trails-minnesota/">Snowshoeing in Minnesota</a></h2><h3>In the land of lakes, it's easy and fun to get off the beaten path.</h3><p>There are many good reasons to go off trail, and the chance to see moose definitely is one of them.  But then the ranger mentioned she'd seen moose tracks in fresh snow near the park entrance, and we decided to go moose-tracking. Strapping on our snowshoes, we plunged from the road into deep woods.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/best-snowshoe-trails-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/antiques/oronoco-gold-rush/">Oronoco's Gold Rush</a></h2><h3>Every August, treasure hunters converge on a southern Minnesota village.</h3><p>Every August, the tiny southeast Minnesota town of Oronoco becomes the mother lode. Tents full of carved armoires and sideboards pop up along the town's narrow streets. Yards sprout crates of antique lunch boxes and duck decoys. The church ladies bake pies, the VFW folks flip pancakes and firefighters put hot dogs on the grill. Then the people come, stampeding through the streets like sheep to salt.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/antiques/oronoco-gold-rush/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/bockfest-new-ulm/">A German Mardi Gras</a></h2><h3>At New Ulm's Bock Fest, the good times roll in on a tide of beer.</h3><p>Oh, the joy of being German. There's no question that Germans know how to have a good time. After all, they've given the world Oktoberfest, half-gallon steins and "The Little Chicken Dance.'' Hopfen und Malz, Gott erhalts'' roughly translates as "Malt and hops, to God, are tops.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/breweries-vineyards/bockfest-new-ulm/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/bed-breakfast/lanesboro-BBs-inns/">Lodgings in Lanesboro</a></h2><h3>In this bluff-country bicycling capital, take your choice of B&amp;Bs, small inns and even cabins.</h3><p>Before the Root River State Trail was built, the only places to stay in Lanesboro were some small hunters' cabins near the city park.  With visitors pouring in, Lanesboro also has become the bed-and-breakfast capital of the Minnesota, with more B&Bs than any other town, plus several small inns.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/bed-breakfast/lanesboro-BBs-inns/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/guided-trips/amish-tours-minnesota/">Amish country</a></h2><h3>In the southeast corner of Minnesota, folks are different, yet not so different.</h3><p>In southeast Minnesota, some of the locals stand out a bit. They travel in horse-drawn buggies, they dress only in dark colors and they speak an archaic German dialect. In their homes and workshops, they refuse to use electricity, natural gas or plumbing, all of which would literally connect them to the outside world. They're Old Order Amish, direct descendants of a Swiss religious group that believed Martin Luther and other Reformation leaders didn't go far enough in returning the church to strict Scripture.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/guided-trips/amish-tours-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Roaming in Red Wing</a></h2><h3>A scenic Mississippi River town is a magnet for tourists and day-trippers from the Twin Cities.</h3><p>For many years, Red Wing has been Twin Citians' favorite day-trip destination. It's adorable, with its brick storefronts, flowering planters hung from lampposts and rows of stately Victorian houses in three historic districts. Sitting on a sharp elbow of the Mississippi, it's a small town that still looks the part &mdash; it has a bakery, a barber shop, a homespun caf&eacute; &mdash; and it was the first Minnesota town on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's list of Distinctive Destinations.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadtrips/bluff-country-minnesota-fall/">Road trip: Bluff-country byways</a></h2><h3>During harvest, the towns around Lanesboro in Minnesota's southeast corner yield a cornucopia of treats and scenery.</h3><p>At harvest time, Minnesota's bluff country overflows with beauty. Fat pumpkins await buyers at farmers' markets. Golden clumps of wildflowers line bicycle trails. From buggies, the Amish sell homemade baskets, bumbleberry jam and apple butter.
