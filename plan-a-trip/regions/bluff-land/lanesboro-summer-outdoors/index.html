<h2>Head out from this Minnesota river town by tube, canoe, kayak, bike or skates.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanesboro_tubing.jpg" alt="Tubes on the Root River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Root River east of Lanesboro is a favorite spot for tubing.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>For a hamlet out in nowhere, Lanesboro is picturesquely blessed.</p>
<p>It's hemmed in by tall limestone bluffs, circled by a spring-fed trout
stream and bisected by one of the nation's best bicycle trails.</p>
<p>Eagles, herons and egrets cruise along the scenic river just to the
north, alongside canoeists and kayakers.</p>
<p>But Mother Nature can throw it for a loop in spring, when the Root rises
and, sometimes, floods the towns along its path.</p>
<p>Even in an ordinary year, businesses suffer when spring is slow to
arrive. But when it does, don't waste time.</p>
<p>One year, my niece Livi and I went on the first nice weekend of June,
throwing off the effects of a raw spring.</p>
<p>Draped over inner tubes on the Root River, nearly somnolent in the hot
sun, we marveled at the scenery, the serenity and a perfect confluence
of river conditions: fast water, great weather and a stiff tail wind.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;And no people!&quot; Livi said, then added in mock indignation: &quot;What's
wrong with those people?&quot;</p>
<p>On a summer's day, few places make a better escape than Lanesboro and
its river.</p>
<p>On our first day, Livi and I rented a canoe. Putting in at the Moen's
Bridge access on the North Branch of the Root, we glided past solid
limestone bluffs, bouncing through riffles and rapids every mile or so.</p>
<p>Cliff swallows and warblers made swooping arcs around us, and a great
blue heron became our scout, accompanying us for miles by flapping
ahead, waiting until we caught up and finally passing us off to a
smaller heron.</p>
<p>We paddled around the ruins of an old dam, then approached an especially
tall bluff, where we saw the high-ropes course of Eagle Bluff
Environmental Learning Center poking out of the treetops.</p>
<p>An abandoned 1915 power plant clung to the base of the bluff, a ladder
reaching from the river into an empty concrete doorway. On the other
bank, we saw a bald eagle sitting in the lowest branch of a tree, its
haughty pale-yellow eyes gazing in every direction except at us.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanesboro_root_river_biking.jpg" alt="Spring bicycling on the Root River State Trail." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

Lanesboro.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We also saw ducks, geese, cows and a deer, but no people until Mile 12,
where the North Branch joins the South Branch and the bicycle trail
three miles above Lanesboro.</p>
<p>In another four miles we were at Whalan, trying to avoid the
industrial-strength mud at the takeout.</p>
<p>And we still weren't finished with the river. After returning the
paddles and life jackets, we set off to ride the Root River State
Trail's easternmost section.</p>
<p>Livi started in Rushford and I set out from Houston's Nature Center,
gliding down to the river and into forest that lined pancake-flat valley
floors, which, with the peaked hills surrounding them, mark the
beginning of the coulee country that stretches into southwest Wisconsin.</p>
<p>It was a wild, exhilarating ride — not being on a former rail
corridor, it's definitely not flat — and its easternmost scenery
rivals the stretch from Isinours Junction to Preston, on the other end
of the trail.</p>
<p>It's a great addition to the 60-mile system, which includes the 18-mile
Harmony-Preston Valley State Trail.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The next morning, we were back along the Root River, this time on
in-line skates. We headed west from the downtown trestle bridge, under
which two Amish teen-agers were fishing, and soon were cruising along a
quiet corridor lined by Queen Anne's lace.</p>
<p>Then, having worked up a sweat, we rented tubes from Root River
Outfitters and plopped into the river behind the shop, just below the
1868 dam.</p>
<p>The water turned our backsides into Popsicles — the South Branch is
spring-fed and much colder than the North Branch — and we wondered
what we'd let ourselves in for.</p>
<p>But the a series of rapids grabbed us — just like an amusement-park
flume ride, except with real rocks — and before we knew it, we'd
floated into the warmer waters of the North Branch, where we leaned
back, wiggled our toes and looked pityingly at the bicyclists above,
sweating in their helmets and shoes.</p>
<p>While we were in Lanesboro, we also saw a play, browsed at the art
center and bought perennials from the Amish at the Saturday farmers
market in Sylvan Park.</p>
<p>But we knew it would be the cool Root River of which we'd dream later
in the summer, as we sweltered in the heat.</p>
<p>&quot;When I'm sitting in my office thinking of something to look forward
to,&quot; said Livi, lolling on her tube, &quot;this will be it.&quot;</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: Outdoors in Lanesboro, Minnesota</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/a/lanesboro_root_river_2canoes.jpg" alt="Canoeists paddle the Root River near Lanesboro." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><em>Getting there</em> : It's in the southeast corner of Minnesota, 15 minutes
east of U.S. 52.</p>
<p>For more about summer in Lanesboro, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/lanesboro-minnesota-sightseeing/">The belle of bluff
country</a>.</p>
<p><em>2022 events</em> : May 21, <a href="http://www.rootrivertriathlon.org/">Root River
Triathlon</a> from Houston, with an
eight-mile bike ride, three-mile run and 6.8 canoe or kayak stretch.
August, <a href="https://foundationforr-pschools.org/bluff-land-tri/">Bluff Land
Triathlon</a> between
Peterson and Rushford, with a 15.5 mile bike ride, 3.1-mile run and 2.1
hike.</p>
<p><em>Accommodations</em> : Lanesboro has many fine inns and B&amp;Bs. For a list
with descriptions, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/bed-breakfast/lanesboro-BBs/">Lodgings in
Lanesboro</a>.</p>
<p>In Whalan, the <a href="http://www.cedarvalleyresort.com">Cedar Valley Resort</a>
is right on the river and trail and has large cabins, perfect for
groups. It's a good take-out point for tubes, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lanesboro.com/list/category/campgrounds-5"><strong>Camping</strong></a> :
Sites at Lanesboro's <a href="http://www.lanesboro.com/list/member/sylvan-park-riverview-campgrounds-lanesboro-229">Sylvan Park and Riverview
campgrounds</a>, on the river, are first-come, first-served. Sixty tent sites are $20
and 43 camper sites $30. Hot showers are in the community center.</p>
<p><em>Canoeing</em> : Rainfall speeds up the <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/watertrails/rootriver/index.html">Root
River</a>
considerably, but in general, the 16-mile North Branch trip from Moen's
Landing to Whalan takes 4 to 4½ hours.</p>
<p>Outfitters often recommend the slower 14-mile South Branch stretch from
Preston to Lanesboro if the North Branch is too high; the 16 miles
between Whalan and Rushford also are an option.</p>
<p>For a route map, call the DNR at 800-766-6000 or 651-296-6157; the
Lanesboro visitors center also stocks them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/LittleRiverGeneralStore/">Little River General
Store</a>, <a href="https://cedarvalleyresort.com/outfitting/">Cedar
Valley Resort</a> and <a href="https://eagle-cliff.com/outfitting/">Eagle
Cliff Campground</a> are among
the outfitters that provide boats and shuttles.</p>
<p><em>Tubing</em> : The South Branch of the Root River carves a shady one-mile
loop around downtown Lanesboro that takes about 45 minutes on a tube;
people can get in below the dam, out at the County Road 250 bridge and
walk back with their tubes on the state trail to do it again.</p>
<p>Or, they can tube to the Minnesota 16 access, 2½-hours, or Whalan, about
five hours.</p>
<p><em>Bicycling</em> : The 42-mile <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/root_river/index.html">Root River State
Trail</a>
and 18-mile <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/blufflands/harmony_preston.html">Harmony-Preston Valley State
Trail</a>, which connects to the Root five miles west of Lanesboro, are
Minnesota's pride and joy.</p>
<p>Besides the big hill five miles west of Houston, the only hills are up
to Harmony and Fountain; many bicyclists like to take shuttles and start
from there.</p>
