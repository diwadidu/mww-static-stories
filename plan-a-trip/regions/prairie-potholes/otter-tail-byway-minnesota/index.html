<h2>Big surprises pop up along a scenic byway in northwest Minnesota.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/e/fergus_falls_otter.jpg" alt="A giant otter is Fergus Falls' mascot." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>In Minnesota's Otter Tail County, everything comes extra-large and in
multiples.</p>
<p>Few know that this county near the North Dakota border has more lakes
than any other in Minnesota — 1,048 — or even that it has lakes at
all.</p>
<p>It also has the state's densest concentration of giant mascots and
roadside sculptures, largely thanks to a scrap-metal wizard who also is
the father of an astronaut.</p>
<p>But before he made his first piece, a 1,200-pound foot, the county
already had a 23-foot fiberglass warrior plus a 15½-foot pelican and
22-foot otter, both billed as the world's largest.</p>
<p>One of the newer pieces is another giant otter — because in Otter
Tail County, one is never enough.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>All of the giants can be seen along the Otter Trail Scenic Byway. For
not only is the county overflowing with mammoth mammals, it's amazingly
scenic.</p>
<p>This 150-mile loop passes two state parks, a picture-postcard historic
mill and Inspiration Peak, the state's second-highest point after Eagle
Mountain on the North Shore.</p>
<p>Nobel Prize-winning author Sinclair Lewis was thinking about Otter Tail
County when he chided other Minnesotans for not knowing about their own
&quot;haunts of beauty.&quot;</p>
<p>The rolling landscape was created by the back-and-forth scraping of
glaciers from four ice ages.</p>
<p>It left a glacial moraine of kames, piles of gravel dropped by receding
glaciers, and kettles, created when block of ice fell off, pressed into
the earth, melted and filled up again as ponds and lakes.</p>
<p>It's the kettles Lewis saw when he climbed <em>Inspiration Peak,</em>  a high
kame atop the hilly moraine.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/h/phelps_mill2.jpg" alt="Historic Phelps Mill in northwest Minnesota." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
On the Otter Tail River, Phelps Mill still is filled with century-old
machinery.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>His ode to the view of &quot;a glorious 20-mile circle of some 50 lakes,
scattered among fields and pastures like sequins fallen on an old
paisley shawl,&quot; led people to begin calling it Inspiration Peak, and
the name stuck.</p>
<p>Today, a short but steep asphalt path leads to the summit, cloaked with
prairie wildflowers.</p>
<p>From there, fields and woods undulate into the far-off haze; just to the
west, the eastern hardwood forest gives way to what once, below the
arrival of the plow, was a sea of tall-grass prairie.</p>
<p>From the peak, the byway heads west, through <em>Dalton,</em>  where the
steam-threshing days of the early 1900s are re-created the weekend after
Labor Day.</p>
<p>Near <em>Fergus Falls,</em>  it passes the Prairie Wetlands Learning Center,
where four miles of nature trails and boardwalks wind through 200 acres
of restored grasslands and 38 acres of wetlands.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>In town, the original giant otter crouches alongside Grotto Lake. A
tree-lined Riverwalk winds through a pretty downtown that includes A
Center for the Arts, a 1921 vaudeville house that now is a venue for
music, theater and film.</p>
<p>From Fergus, the route heads east to <em>Phelps Mill Park.</em>  Set deep in
lake country, it's a dreamy place that evokes a nostalgia for a time
most of us never knew.</p>
<p>Above the dam, on nice summer days, teen-agers swing from a tree into
the Otter Tail River; below, families gather to fish.</p>
<p>The 1889 brick and clapboard mill, once the center of a bucolic rural
community, was made obsolete by the rise of the huge mills in
Minneapolis, and the rails that brought local grain directly to them.</p>
<p>The mill closed in 1939, but it's still filled with heavy machinery for
grinding, sifting and sorting. The grounds along the Otter Tail River
host one of the region's most popular festivals, featuring an arts and
crafts fair, music and home-cooked food.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/battle_lake_indian.jpg" alt="Chief Wenonga in Battle Lake." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A statue of the Ojibwe leader Wenonga stands on the north edge of Battle
Lake.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>To the north, the byway skirts the southern border of <em>Maplewood State
Park,</em>  a big park with 25 miles of hiking trails. It has eight large
lakes and another dozen kettle lakes amid a series of high hills,
created when one glacier rear-ended another and dumped piles of debris.</p>
<p>Stands of basswood, sugar maple and oak here mark the very end of the
hardwood forest, and the park's overlooks are a good place to spot fall
color.</p>
<p>In <em>Pelican Rapids,</em>  a 15½-foot concrete pelican stands in the froth
below Mill Pond Dam, just off the main street. Early settlers saw
pelicans feeding at the original rapids. Now, the birds stop at nearby
Lake Lida, which the scenic byway passes on its route east.</p>
<p><em>Perham</em> is the home of turtle races, held on Wednesday mornings in
summer, and the Barrel O' Fun factory, which makes chips from the local
potatoes that grow well in this transitional zone between prairie and
pine forest.</p>
<p>From there, the byway heads south past the town of <em>Ottertail,</em>  where a
second giant otter reclines with his paw on a fish. Then it hugs the
eastern shore of big Otter Tail Lake and heads into <em>Battle Lake.</em></p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>An early resort town frequented by millionaires from Missouri and points
west, the village of 700 has become a laid-back hub for the local
cottagers and tourists, who can stop in the gift shops and cafes that
line wide Lake Avenue.</p>
<p>Nearly everyone stops in at Granny's Pantry for ice cream or bulk
candy, which includes baskets of old-time penny candy and a big
selection of gummies.</p>
<p>Just north of downtown, the stern, 23-foot-tall Chief Wenonga stands
along the shore of West Battle Lake, named for a 1795 battle between the
Dakota and Ojibwe, who were badly beaten and renamed the lake
<em>Ish-quan-a-de-win-ing,</em> meaning, &quot;where but few survived.&quot;</p>
<p>This area, a coveted hunting ground, was for many years thereafter part
of the &quot;war road&quot; between the rival tribes.</p>
<p>A lovely paved bicycle trail connects Battle Lake and <em>Glendalough State
Park,</em>  which includes six undeveloped lakes, two of them havens for
waterfowl.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/l/glendalough_lodge.jpg" alt="The lodge at Glendalough State Park." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The lodge in Glendalough State Park hosted two presidents.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Formerly a private game preserve owned by the Cowles family, which owned
the Minneapolis Star Tribune, it's hosted two presidents — Dwight
Eisenhower and Richard Nixon — and many other high-profile visitors.</p>
<p>Glendalough is kept more rustic than most state parks, with cart-in tent
camping and two yurts that can be reached only by foot, bicycle or
boat.</p>
<p>There's bird-watching and bicycling on a trail circles the lake, and
several sand beaches on Annie Battle Lake. The best beach is in front of
the former Cowles lodge, which large families and other groups can rent
for day use.</p>
<p>East of Battle Lake is the tiny village of <em>Vining,</em>  which the Nyberg
family has put on the map. For decades, construction foreman Ken Nyberg
has been collecting pieces of scrap metal and turning them into quirky
sculptures.</p>
<p>First came a foot with an oversized big toe, then a square knot, then a
coffee cup poised in mid-air, a pliers gripping a cockroach and a knife
slicing a watermelon.</p>

<p>An astronaut pays tribute to his daughter Karen Nyberg, a NASA scientist
who made regular visits to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Now that he's retired, Nyberg has picked up the pace, adding an
elephant and a hand holding a football, both made of lawnmower blades,
and a spoon dancing with a knife.</p>
<p>There's more at his studio on the edge of town, including a giant
giraffe, rhino, ram and heron.</p>
<p>From Vining, the route dips down to Urbank and back to Inspiration Peak.
From there, it's just a short sprint to I-94 — and the regular-sized
world.</p>
