That's North Shore 101.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/favorite-places/hidden-places-north-shore/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/grand-marais-minnesota-arts/">Artistic Grand Marais</a></h2><h3>On the shores of Lake Superior, this once-rugged village is a cultural outpost.</h3><p>A hundred years ago, Grand Marais was a wind-buffeted outpost  at the tip of the North Shore, stomping grounds of  trappers, loggers and fishermen.  The dirt road connecting the village to Duluth often was impassable,  and winter provisions had to be brought in by steamer before Lake Superior iced over. But amid the hardship, there was always art.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/grand-marais-minnesota-arts/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/photographers-north-shore-minnesota/">Following the photographers: Lake Superior in Minnesota</a></h2><h3>Wish you were there? For people who love the North Shore, online images are next best thing.</h3><p>Do you love to see gorgeous photos of your favorite landscapes, especially when you're sitting in an office cubicle?  One place especially blessed with photographers who share their work is Minnesota's dramatic North Shore of Lake Superior, where world-class scenery stretches from Duluth to the Canadian border.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/photographers-north-shore-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/visiting-grand-portage/">Life on the Grand Portage</a></h2><h3>Once, a corner of northeast Minnesota was the center of the fur-trade universe.</h3><p>Long before Minnesota existed, Grand Portage was as familiar a name to many Europeans as George Washington.  It was the crossroads of a continent, the place where voyageurs laden with goods from Montreal met voyageurs laden with beaver pelts from the Canadian wilderness.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/visiting-grand-portage/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/lighthouse-stays-lake-superior/">Dwelling in the past</a></h2><h3>Around Lake Superior, overnight guests can try out life at a lighthouse.</h3><p>When Lake Superior lighthouses had keepers, there was nothing romantic about life there. The posts were cold, lonely and meagerly furnished on the government dime. The work was physically taxing and repetitive. Through the long nights, keepers had to get up every two hours to wind the mechanism that rotated the lens. It's no wonder many of the early lighthouse keepers were hermits or grouches.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/lighthouse-stays-lake-superior/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-north-shore/">Beaches of Minnesota's North Shore</a></h2><h3>Agate-hunters, storm-watchers and picnickers all want to be close to the edge.</h3><p>Big, bad Lake Superior. It's big as in vast, with a surface area equal to Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire combined. It's bad as in lethal, able to swallow ore boats or pulverize them against the hard volcanic rock that lines its shore. And it's treacherous &mdash;  like an enraged bull, its crushing waves can turn on a dime.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/beaches-north-shore/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/wildflowers-spring-north-shore/">Wildflowers of the North Shore</a></h2><h3>On the shores of Lake Superior, delicate blooms mark the return of warmth.</h3><p>In spring, not that many people go to the North Shore to see the flowers.  They're small, and the rest of the scenery is big and distracting &mdash; roaring waterfalls, jagged cliffs and that mesmerizing inland sea that fills the horizon.  If you do look down, you'll find them huddled in cracks on lava flows, tucked along hiking trails and in boggy patches along streams. They're dainty, but many are fairly unusual &mdash; butterwort as well as bluebells, rock clematis along with columbine.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/wildflowers-spring-north-shore/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/lutsen-ski-lessons/">Classroom on the slopes</a></h2><h3>Alpine skiing is more fun when you learn how to do it better.</h3><p>When you live in the frozen north, you may as well embrace winter. My idea of fun is to cross-country ski, but for that, Mother Nature needs to bring snow. But alpine skiing, which I also like, requires only some big snow guns. After one  wimpy winter, I bought alpine skis. They cost a lot, but I can actually use them, unlike my Nordic skis, all winter long.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/lutsen-ski-lessons/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/skiing-lutsen-mountains-minnesota/">Skiing at Lutsen</a></h2><h3>It's party time at the region's largest ski area, high above Lake Superior. </h3><p>For alpine skiers, these are the best days of the year. At least, they are at Lutsen Mountains on Minnesota's North Shore. Started in 1948, the ski hill has the region's steepest vertical drop, the longest runs and the widest variety, plus a killer view of Lake Superior.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/alpine-skiing/skiing-lutsen-mountains-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/ski-north-shore-minnesota/">Skiing on Minnesota's North Shore</a></h2><h3>On snow-laden trails, cross-country skiers glide on cloud nine.</h3><p>On Minnesota's North Shore, it's a happy day when snow is as abundant as scenery. Despite its miles of cross-country ski trails, the western shore of Lake Superior gets only modest amounts of lake-effect snow, because the storms that blow in from the east tend to dump it inland, where the land mass is colder. So if you want to ski, the trick is to head for the hills, ignoring the thinner snow along the highway.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/ski-north-shore-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/guided-hiking-superior-trail/">Trekking the Superior Hiking Trail</a></h2><h3>You can backpack, day hike, stay in lodges or go with a group on Minnesota's premier path.</h3><p>To a novice, Minnesota's Superior Hiking Trail presents a bewilderment of possibilities. There are 310 miles of trail between Jay Cooke State Park near Duluth and the Canadian border. Some are in the city, some deep in forest. Many stretches include spectacular views of Lake Superior, but others (gasp!) are a little boring. People come from all over the nation to hike this beloved trail, and some take three or four weeks and do the whole thing. But there are many ways to hike the trail.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/guided-hiking-superior-trail/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">Hiking Minnesota's North Shore</a></h2><h3>For most, a day hike is the preferred way to soak up the scenery.</h3><p>It took me nearly 20 years of hiking on the North Shore to tackle Eagle Mountain. It's the highest point in Minnesota, but it's not exactly on the shore; it's 14 miles inland, as the crow flies. I was used to tramping along the rocky river gorges whose horehound-tinted waters rivers boil furiously down to Lake Superior; I was used to drama.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Four seasons of Grand Marais</a></h2><h3>In the theater of seasons, this Lake Superior village always is ready for its close-up.</h3><p>At the far tip of northern Minnesota, Grand Marais is a place that people love even more when the weather turns. When Lake Superior storms send giant waves crashing against the pier light, photographers rush to the harbor. Blizzards bring in skiers, and tourists flock to see ice floes and formations. This photogenic village at the foot of the Sawtooth range is a drama queen, a magnet for those who bask in the big lake's chill and revel in its unpredictability.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-rivers-north-shore/">Snowshoeing river canyons of the North Shore</a></h2><h3>In winter, ice creates scenic new routes for hikers.</h3><p>On Minnesota's North Shore, winter opens new avenues for explorers. Miles of hiking trails already follow the gorges of rivers that flow into Lake Superior. But why hike the trails when you can hike on the river itself? A frozen river takes you straight into the scenery  - the slot canyons of the Onion, the steep red cliffs of the Devil Track, the waterfalls of the Baptism.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-rivers-north-shore/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/water-sports/late-summer-deals/">Summer's last resort</a></h2><h3>At a resort on a ski hill overlooking Lake Superior, we find a sweet deal in late August.</h3><p>By the second week, football and band practice has started at schools, and back-to-school sales are in progress. In Minnesota, everyone wants to go to the State Fair. Not many people are thinking about vacation &mdash; which is precisely why it's a great time to take one. The weather is still warm and sunny, the crowds are gone and, best of all, prices drop, usually on the second or third Sunday.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/water-sports/late-summer-deals/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/beargrease-sled-dog-duluth/">Chasing the Beargrease</a></h2><h3>Along Minnesota's North Shore, the grueling sled-dog race enthralls onlookers.</h3><p>Long before reality shows turned survival into a stunt, there was John Beargrease. With no fanfare and no road, the Ojibwe man delivered the weekly mail between Two Harbors and Grand Marais until 1899, using a dog team in winter. Using only four dogs to pull packs of up to 700 pounds, Beargrease could make the round-trip in a few days. His stamina spawned a legend. Now mushers from around the nation come to trace his path, racing each other from Duluth to the Gunflint Trail in the John Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/beargrease-sled-dog-duluth/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/dog-sledding-minnesota/">Dog days of winter</a></h2><h3>Deep in Superior National Forest, novice mushers tag along with some huskies.</h3><p>In the north woods, it's easy to fall in love with sled dogs. They're exuberant and adorable but also focused, intense and explosive &mdash; sort of like kindergartners crossed with Olympic athletes.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/dog-sledding-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/gooseberry-falls/">Gooseberries on ice</a></h2><h3>In winter, a beloved state park turns into a big, frozen playground.</h3><p>There's one spot along the North Shore at which everyone has to stop. Its five falls tumble over lumpy floes of ancient lava, filling the air with mist and tumult. Intriguing crannies, created by jagged walls of rock and twisted cedars, turn adults into compulsive shutterbugs and bring out the Indiana Jones in children, who clamber from one precipice to another.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/gooseberry-falls/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/north-shore-ice-playgrounds/">Ice playgrounds</a></h2><h3>Along rivers and lakes, it's fun to play with Jack Frost.</h3><p>In winter, ice comes with the territory. You can curse it &mdash; or you can play with it. Kids know how. Climbers and skaters know how. And photographers adore it. Having fun with ice also is a good way to cope with a winter that drags on, endlessly, into April.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/north-shore-ice-playgrounds/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-minnesota/trip-planning-north-shore-minnesota/">North Shore by the mile</a></h2><h3>Planning a trip to this beloved stretch of Lake Superior? Start at 0.0.</h3><p>If you don't know much about Minnesota's North Shore, trip-planning can be confusing. For one thing, it's really the west shore of Lake Superior. People in Ontario don't get confused because they live on the real north shore. Chicagoans do because they call their northern suburbs the North Shore. This pointy corner of Minnesota also is called the Arrowhead Region. Some people call its roads by their names &mdash; Sawbill and Caribou &mdash; and some by their numbers &mdash; County Road 2 and County Road 4.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-minnesota/trip-planning-north-shore-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/north-shore-biking/">Walk 'n' roll</a></h2><h3>Thanks to the Gitchi-Gami, you can hike one-way on Minnesota's North Shore and bike back.</h3><p>Going hiking on the Superior Hiking Trail? You'll want to pack sturdy boots, thick socks, water bottles, maps and rain gear. Oh, and don't forget the bikes. There's a bicycle trail on the North Shore, a nice flat one. It's the paved Gitchi-Gami State Trail, with a 14-mile stretch that links Gooseberry Falls to Split Rock State Park and Beaver Bay and a 10.5-mile stretch that links Schroeder to Temperance River State Park, Tofte and Lutsen.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/north-shore-biking/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/north-shore-lodgings/">Where to stay on Minnesota's North Shore</a></h2><h3>Everyone wants a place to stay on the big lake, and here's a guide to the best.</h3><p>In summer and fall, don't rely on luck to get a reservation on Minnesota's North Shore. In the heat of summer, everyone wants to bask in Lake Superior's cooling breezes. In fall, everyone wants to see the fall colors. On winter weekends, skiers flock in.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/north-shore-lodgings/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/dining-north-shore/">Dining on Minnesota's North Shore</a></h2><h3>Finally, the cuisine matches the scenery on a favorite tourist route.</h3><p>Thirty years ago, dining on the North Shore was pleasant, if a little utilitarian. A meal often came with a view, but most of the menus had the same fish, steak, chops and burgers you could get anywhere.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/dining-north-shore/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/tettegouche-park-cabins/">Heirs to a hideaway</a></h2><h3>High above the North Shore, a spot at the historic Tettegouche Camp is as prized as ever.</h3><p>Every week, a few dozen people join an exclusive club high above Minnesota's North Shore. To get there, they lug all their food and gear 1.75 miles up and down a steep hill. They draw their own water and make their own fires. They clean and then lug their garbage over the same hill. And they consider themselves lucky.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/tettegouche-park-cabins/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/tettegouche-state-park-cabins/">Cabin on a waterfall</a></h2><h3>On the edge of a waterfall on Minnesota's North Shore, a state-park guesthouse is a prized hideaway.</h3><p>In Minnesota's state parks, the goodies go way beyond hiking trails, picnic sites and fishing piers.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/tettegouche-state-park-cabins/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/hotels-motels/cheap-motels-grand-marais-north-shore/">Mom-and-pop motels of Grand Marais</a></h2><h3>Cheapskates love 'em, but so do traditionalists and anyone who just needs a room.</h3><p>In summer, when the cities start to sizzle, a lot of people suddenly realize they'd rather be in Grand Marais. This village on Minnesota's North Shore is awash in Lake Superior's cool breezes, and it has everything else a tourist could want &mdash; restaurants, shops, galleries, nightlife and scenery. But it doesn't always have enough room for all of the escapees, especially on festival weekends.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/hotels-motels/cheap-motels-grand-marais-north-shore/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/lutsen-lodge-north-shore/">Loving Lutsen</a></h2><h3>For more than 130 years, this beloved resort has been drawing guests to the North Shore.</h3><p>When people have been beating a path to your door for more than 130 years, you're probably doing something right. Swedish immigrants C.A.A. and Anna Nelson were accidental hosts in 1886, when they began putting up travelers in their new home at the mouth of the Poplar River, chosen because it was C.A.A.'s favorite fishing spot. More people came, and their Lutzen House became Lutsen Resort. Their children and grandchildren added a gabled lodge, ski hill, pool and townhomes. Then came log cabins, luxury condos, a golf course, a gourmet chef and  a spa.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/lutsen-lodge-north-shore/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/naniboujou-lodge-minnesota/">Serenity at Naniboujou</a></h2><h3>On Lake Superior, a historic Jazz Age lodge still inspires reverence.</h3><p>During the heady days of the Roaring Twenties, a group of Duluth businessmen conceived a plan.  They'd build a clubhouse, with tennis courts and golf course and swimming pool. And they'd name the whole thing for Naniboujou, the powerful but benevolent Ojibwe spirit who claimed this northern wilderness as his own.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/naniboujou-lodge-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-colors-north-shore/">Colors of the North Shore</a></h2><h3>In fall, crowds pursue the hues along the shore of Lake Superior.</h3><p>In autumn, crowds of leaf-peepers mob Minnesota's North Shore, looking for fabulous fall color.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/fall-colors-north-shore/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/north-shore-late-fall/">Quiet time on Minnesota's North Shore</a></h2><h3>This quiet season is marked by stark beauty, cheaper stays and the gales of November.</h3><p>The skies were leaden and forbidding as Lake Superior slid into view and we descended into Duluth. The wind mauled our hair as we stood alongside the harbor canal, waving to the crew of the Sea Pearl II as it pushed toward Malta with a load of grain. Driving up the shore, we listened to taped stories of shipwrecks: The sidewheeler Lotta Bernard, pummeled into pieces off Gooseberry Falls on Oct. 29, 1874.  The steamer Edenborn, hurled into the mouth of Split Rock River and broken in two on Nov. 28, 1905.

The Slovenian priest arrived in 1831 and spent a long and frenetic life canoeing and snowshoeing between Ojibwe settlements in Sault Ste.

It's a 150-mile stretch of wild beauty, lined by piles of jagged black basalt, cobblestone beaches and the mouths of dozens of rivers, tumbling down from the old beaches of Glacial Lake Duluth.
