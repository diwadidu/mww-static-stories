<p>Going hiking on the Superior Hiking Trail? You'll want to pack sturdy
boots, thick socks, water bottles, maps and rain gear.</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget the bikes.</p>
<p>There's a bicycle trail on the North Shore, a nice flat one. It's the
paved Gitchi-Gami State Trail, with a 17-mile stretch that links
Gooseberry Falls to Split Rock State Park, Beaver Bay and Silver Bay, and a 12-mile
stretch that links Schroeder to Temperance River State Park, Tofte and
Lutsen.</p>
<p>Bicyclists and skaters love the trail, of course. But so do hikers up on
the ridgeline — because if they stash bikes at the end of their hikes,
they can spend the whole day hiking one way, then use the trail to get
back to their cars in a flash.</p>
<p>It has always been possible for hikers to shuttle themselves by bike
along the Superior Hiking Trail, and in some places, the shoulders on
Minnesota 61 make it fairly safe.</p>
<p>But the Gitchi-Gami State Trail makes it safe and fun.</p>

<h3>Hiking from Temperance</h3>
<p>One August, my husband and I left our bikes at the Britton Peak
Trailhead, 2½ miles up the Sawbill Trail from Tofte. Then, we drove to
the Temperance River Wayside, left our car and started hiking up the
east side of the river.</p>
<p>There were a lot of people along its narrow, rocky gorge, mostly
watching two swimmers, a heavily tattooed man and a woman in a purple
bikini.</p>
<p>The man was giving onlookers a thrill by jumping over waterfalls and
into pools of dark water, not particularly smart considering the river
was lower than we'd ever seen it.</p>
<p>&quot;He climbed up here in his bare feet and jumped off, must've been 100
feet!&quot; one watcher exclaimed as we passed.</p>
<p>As usual, people were hanging over the sides of the bridge above, gazing
into the swirling river. As we looked up, we saw two bicyclists zooming
by behind them, which surprised us until we realized the bridge is now
part of the Gitchi-Gami.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/e/temperance_bridge.jpg" alt="A bridge over the Temperance River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

over the gorge.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>As soon as we left the river, we left the people. As famous as the
Superior Hiking Trail has become, the vast majority of visitors don't
venture beyond the scenic river gorges.</p>
<p>The maples already were changing color, and the trail was lined with
fireweed and blue aster. Dry conditions had kept the insect population
down, and hiking was as good as it gets. Even so, we passed only four
other people on the way to Carlton Peak.</p>
<p>Suddenly, its smooth gray flank loomed ahead of us, heaved up from the
Earth's crust a billion years ago.</p>
<p>Once atop the 924-foot summit, it's hard to leave. There's a panoramic
view of lake and inland forests, and the rock dome, warmed by the sun,
is a good place to stretch out as lake breezes whip about overhead.</p>
<p>As we lounged amid the foundations of an old fire tower, a family of
four climbed up and tried to launch kites into the Lake Superior
breezes.</p>
<p>People seem to just materialize on Carlton Peak. When we finally left,
there were 16 people atop the rock, yet we saw no one along the 1½ miles
to Britton Peak.</p>
<h3>Back by bike</h3>
<p>The good thing about having a bike at Britton Peak is the fun has just
begun. We hopped on and started flying downhill, at one point keeping
pace with a deer we'd startled.  Over 2½ miles, I had to pedal only a
few times.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>At the highway, we looked for the bike trail and finally asked at
Bluefin Bay resort, where staff directed us through the resort, past the
fire hall and onto Tofte Park Road.</p>
<p>That took us past tiny Tofte Park, which had a charming 1920s
cobblestone fountain, bridge and sluiceway, and on to the little boat
launch.</p>
<p>A nor'easter was picking up strength, and waves were pounding against
its breakwall of basalt boulders, sending a wall of water at least 40
feet into the air.</p>
<p>At the end of the town road, we crossed the highway to the Gitchi-Gami,
following it through forest and into Temperance River State Park.</p>
<p>Soon, we were the bicyclists zooming over the gorge bridge.</p>
<h3>Trip Tips: North Shore hikes with bikes</h3>
<p>To shuttle yourselves, simply leave bikes at the end of your hike and
drive to where you want to start.</p>

<p>On the 4.8-mile stretch of the Superior Hiking Trail between Temperance
River State Park to Britton Peak and the Sawbill Trail (County Road 1),
hikers can lock their bikes at the Britton Peak trailhead and start
hiking from the Temperance River parking area on Minnesota 61.</p>
<p>After you reach Britton Peak, you'll have a 2½-mile downhill glide on
the Sawbill Trail to Tofte, then a three-mile ride on the Gitchi-Gami
State Trail.</p>
<p>There's a short gap between Tofte and the paved trail; ride through
Bluefin Bay resort, follow Town Park Road and cross the highway to get
to the trail.</p>
<p>Bicyclists can ride through Temperance River State Park, then take the
first gravel road they see down to the highway, backtracking a short
distance to their cars.</p>
<p><em>Tip:</em> At the bottom of the Sawbill Trail, buy a picnic at the Coho Cafe
and eat it in Tofte Town Park, along the lake.</p>
<p>Hikers also can use the Gitchi-Gami on other stretches of the Superior
Hiking Trail:</p>
<p>The 5 miles between Gooseberry Falls State Park and the Split Rock River
(it could work for an inline skate shuttle, too).</p>
<p>The 11.3 miles from the Split Rock Lighthouse State Park to County Road
4 (Lax Lake Road), which is paved and goes downhill into Beaver Bay.</p>

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The 4.7 miles between Beaver Bay and Silver Bay.</p>
<p>In <strong>Duluth,</strong> hikers can use Skyline Parkway to return by bike (and
also the city bus).</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/superior-hiking-trail-duluth/">Hiking in
Duluth</a>.</p>
<p>Two other stretches of the Superior Hiking Trail lend themselves to a
bicycle return on the shoulder of Minnesota 61:</p>
<p>The 9 miles from Castle Danger to Gooseberry Falls State Park.</p>
<p>The 5.1 miles from the Arrowhead Trail north of Hovland to Jackson Lake
Road.</p>
<p>But not all sections of Minnesota 61 are safe for bicycling.</p>
<p>&quot;It varies widely,&quot; says the Superior Hiking Trail's Gayle Coyer.
&quot;It goes from a dream shoulder to being barely a foot wide and really
dangerous.&quot;</p>

Outfitters,</a>
at the end of the Sawbill Trail in Tofte, rents road bikes,
