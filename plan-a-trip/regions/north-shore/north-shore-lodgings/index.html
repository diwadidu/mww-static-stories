<h2>Everyone wants a place on the big lake, and here's a guide to the best.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/a/naniboujou_winter.jpg" alt="Naniboujou Lodge is a landmark on the North Shore." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Historic Naniboujou is a quiet retreat across from Magney State Park.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In summer and fall, don't rely on luck to get a reservation on
Minnesota's North Shore.</p>
<p>In the heat of summer, everyone wants to bask in Lake Superior's
cooling breezes. In fall, everyone wants to see the fall colors. On
winter weekends, skiers flock in.</p>
<p>Below are a few of the many places to stay; reserve as far in advance as
possible for popular dates, especially Minnesota's school break the
third weekend of October.</p>
<p>Rates drop in late October and stay low until the holidays; check for
deals. The best deals come in spring. Snow and ice can linger until late
April, and traffic doesn't pick up until school lets out in June.</p>
<p>Traditionally, people go to the North Shore to hike, gaze at the lake
and gather around  evening campfires, so not all cabins have televisions
and phones, and only a few resorts have pools. If you have to have those
things, ask in advance.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Many resorts allow pets in some units for a fee and most resorts have
Wifi. Many resorts offer free shuttles to nearby hiking trailheads, but
some are even more accommodating; if that's important to you, ask when
reserving.</p>
<p>For an introduction to the area, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/minnesota-north-shore/">Escape to Minnesota's North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>For a guide to highlights and locations, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-minnesota/trip-planning-north-shore-minnesota/">North Shore by the
mile</a>.</p>
<p>The properties below that have a hyperlink and are highlighted in bold
are those in which I've stayed and can recommend. I've toured the
properties that have hyperlinks only and think they look fine for their
intended markets.</p>
<h3>Traditional mom-and-pop resorts</h3>
<p>Luckily, there are still small family-run resorts on the North Shore
that have clean, tidy and updated housekeeping cabins (that is, cabins
with a kitchen) on lovely shorelines.</p>
<p>Few cabins have televisions. If you love the old-time North Shore, these
are for you.</p>

camping (see Camping, below).</p>

great location.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><a href="http://cobblestonecabins.biz/">Cobblestone Cabins</a> near <em>Tofte</em> has
eight cabins and a wood-fired sauna right on a lovely cobblestone cove.
People who love the outdoors and the traditional North Shore experience
love this resort, run by avid skier Jan Horak, and its slogan is &quot;For
characters and common folk.&quot; In summer, it rents by the week.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.shoredge.com/">Koeneke Shoredge</a> near <em>Lutsen</em> has three
simple cabins with a great location right on the lake, plus Slabsides, a
small cabin without hot running water. There are swings where guests can
watch the lake and a rock shore perfect for making a fire.</p>
<p>Parking is a short distance from the cabins, an amenity to many people.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.northcountrycottagesmn.com/">North Country Cottages</a> near
<em>Lutsen</em> ,formerly Kah-Nee-Tah Cottages, include three cottages amid
trees.</p>
<p>The cottages have classic north-woods interiors, with fieldstone
wood-burning fireplaces, but no view or access to the lake. Dogs are
welcome.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_kahneetah_cabin.jpg" alt="Kah-Nee-Tah Lakeview cabin." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p><a href="http://www.lundsmotel.biz/index2.html"><strong>Lund's Motel</strong> &amp; Cottages</a> on
the edge of downtown <em>Grand Marais</em> has small but cute cottages on a
tree-shaded property and also an immaculate motel with good rates.</p>
<p>Grand Marais has many inexpensive mom-and-pop motels, some of which also
have cottages, including Nelson's Travelers Rest, across from Lund's.
For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/hotels-motels/cheap-motels-grand-marais-north-shore/">Mom-and-pop motels of Grand
Marais</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.andersonscabins.com/">Anderson's North Shore Resort</a> just
north of <em>Grand Marais</em> has eight attractive cabins on a quiet frontage
road on the lake. No. 2, 3 and 4 are right on a large cobblestone beach
that would be great for small children.</p>
<p>No. 5 is set back but has a wood-burning fireplace, wrap-around deck and
an arty decor.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.croftvilleroadcottages.com/">Croftville Road Cottages</a>,
three miles north of <em>Grand Marais</em> , has three restored 1930s cottages
on a quiet frontage road on the lake. The Arts and Crafts decor is very
attractive, like a good B&amp;B, and each cottage has a gas stove, DVD
player, charcoal grill and fire circle, with firewood provided.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_andersons.jpg" alt="A cabin at Anderson's Resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
At Anderson's near Grand Marais, cabin 4 is right on a pebble beach.

<p>It would be a nice getaway for a couple, but the layout, with a lawn
that leads to a rocky but not jagged shoreline, also is appropriate for
children.</p>
<p><a href="https://deviltracklakecabins.com/">Devil Track Lake Cabins</a>, 12 miles
northwest of <em>Grand Marais</em> , has knotty-pine housekeeping cabins on
Devil Track Lake and rents boats. It's open from June through October.</p>
<h3>Classic lodges</h3>
<p>In <em>Lutsen</em> , the 1952 lodge of <a href="https://www.lutsenresort.com/?__trackcampaign=ZGJYG8Y6">Lutsen
Resort</a> is a
classic, with picture windows overlooking the beach and an incredibly
inviting lobby with a wood-burning hearth. It also has a fine restaurant
(also with great views), a pool complex and a great beach for collecting
rocks and driftwood.</p>
<p>Activities directors give free kayaking lessons/tours, guide hiking and
skiing excursions and provide shuttles for guests who want to go off on
their own. The WatersMeet Spa and Wellness Center is just up the hill.</p>
<p>The
<strong><a href="https://www.lutsenresort.com/lodging/lutsen-lodge/?__trackcampaign=ZGJYG8Y6">lodge</a></strong>
has comfortably furnished, smallish rooms, many with lake views. On the

luxuriously furnished <a href="https://www.lutsenresort.com/lodging/cliff-house-townhomes/?__trackcampaign=ZGJYG8Y6">Cliff House
Townhomes</a>, <a href="https://www.lutsenresort.com/lodging/log-cabins/?__trackcampaign=ZGJYG8Y6">Log

The 1927 Cascade Lodge is a North Shore landmark.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><a href="http://www.cascadelodgemn.com">Cascade Lodge</a>, between <em>Lutsen and
Grand Marais</em> , has a nice variety of cabins, lodge rooms, motel units
and a house, some with whirlpools and fireplaces.</p>
<p>Some of the cabins are 1923 originals; for romance, try Cabin 11, which
is reached by its own wooden bridge high above a small waterfall.</p>
<p>The resort faces the lake on the other side of the highway; it's a
short walk to the trails of Cascade River State Park. In winter, guests
can ski right onto the Deer Yard Lake-Cascade classical system, which
the lodge grooms with a Pisten Bully. It rents cross-country skis and
snowshoes.</p>
<p>There's a good restaurant and pub on the premises. In the shoulder
seasons, the lodge offers excellent value; check for specials.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.naniboujou.com/">Naniboujou Lodge</a>, 14 miles east of <em>Grand
Marais</em> , is a striking 1929 lakeshore lodge across from Judge C.R.
Magney State Park. Its rooms are simple, without phone or TV, but
attractive.</p>
<p>The restaurant, in a great room that has a giant fieldstone fireplace
and walls and ceiling decorated with vivid Cree-style designs, is
stunning and serves fine food.</p>

<h3>Vacation condos/resorts</h3>
<p>This is the new generation of North Shore lodgings. The newest resorts
have multiple owners and are owned by development companies.</p>
<p>Units are right next to each other, and trees are in short supply or
absent. But if you describe your preferences as &quot;upscale,&quot; and you
value king beds, flat-screen TVs, private whirlpools and dishwashers
over the traditional cabin experience (and don't mind paying for them),
these are for you.</p>
<p>Two miles west of <em>Gooseberry Falls</em> , <a href="http://www.grandsuperior.com/">Grand Superior
Lodge</a> includes lodge rooms and luxury
log cabins and townhomes next to the lake. There's also a restaurant
and pool area.</p>
<p>On the edge of <em>Beaver Bay</em> , <strong><a href="http://www.covepointlodge.com">Cove Point
Lodge</a></strong> sits on a very pretty cove. It
has a cozy lobby with a wood-burning fire, restaurant and pool area, and
there are also cottages. Guests can get free use of snowshoes, and it
rents bikes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.temperancelanding.com">Temperance Landing</a>, just north of
the Cross River in <em>Schroeder</em> , is part of the Bluefin Bay family of
resorts; if you gave Ralph Lauren a bunch of Lincoln Logs, this is what
he'd make.</p>
<p>The units are in a tight row, right on the lake, and each has a garage
or carport. Guests can use the indoor pool, whirlpool and sauna at
Surfside on Lake Superior, three miles down the highway.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/o/tofte_bluefin_bay.jpg" alt="In Tofte, Bluefin Bay sits right on Lake Superior." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Bluefin Bay was the first condo-style resort when it opened in 1984.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Bluefin Bay's <a href="https://www.bluefinbay.com/surfside/">Surfside on Lake
Superior</a>, which replaced the old
Surf Side resort near <em>Tofte</em> , rents luxury townhomes and includes a
pool/spa complex and cafe on the property. There's a shuttle to Bluefin
Bay, a mile down the road.</p>
<p>In <em>Tofte</em> , <a href="http://www.bluefinbay.com">Bluefin Bay</a> has many kinds of
units, from standard with hillside view to luxury suites with whirlpool,
fireplace and lake view. Some units are more updated than others; ask
for one in the newer section if that matters to you.</p>
<p>The resort's biggest assets are lake views, from most units and also
from a large outdoor hot tub that is shielded from wind by a glass wall
and an outdoor pool.</p>
<p>There's also an indoor pool complex, the Bluefin Grille restaurant, the
Superior Waters Spa and Wellness Center and the popular Coho Cafe on the
highway.</p>
<p>The resort's activities staff is refreshingly competent, offering gear,
shuttles and advice year-round. In the off season, it offers good deals.</p>
<p>Near <em>Lutsen</em> , the older <a href="https://odysseyresorts.com/lutsen-sea-villas/lutsen-sea-villas-lodging/"><strong>Sea
Villas</strong></a>
are on the lakeshore 2½ miles south of Lutsen Lodge and have a complex
and playground. The villas are individually owned and decorated, with
some more attractive than others, and many allow dogs.</p>
<p>On <em>Lutsen Mountain</em> , <a href="http://www.caribouhighlands.com/">Caribou Highlands
Lodge</a> has a restaurant and attractive
lodge rooms, condos and townhomes. It has a large outdoor heated pool
and offers free family and children's activities in summer, much like a
traditional lake resort.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/l/u/lutsen_caribou_highlands.jpg" alt="The pool at Lutsen's Caribou Highlands resort." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Caribou Highlands Lodge is on a ski mountain, not a lake, so it has a
pool that's especially large.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In late summer and early fall, it offers good deals; see <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/water-sports/late-summer-deals/">Summer's last
resort</a>.
It can also be quite accommodating to backpackers who need a shuttle (be
sure to tip the driver).</p>
<p>Also on <em>Lutsen Mountain</em>, <a href="http://eagleridgeatlutsen.com">Eagle Ridge</a>
** is attractive and very convenient for skiing, being right under the
chairlifts.</p>
<p>In <em>Grand Marais</em>, the <a href="http://www.eastbaysuites.com/">East Bay Suites</a>
has a great location on the pebble beach downtown and is pet-friendly.
The suites are handsomely furnished.</p>
<h3>Hotels</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://www.americinn.com/hotels/mn/silverbay">Americinn</a> in <em>Silver
Bay</em> may be a good place to take your kids; it has a 110-foot spiral
water slide and rates include breakfast with waffle bar.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.americinn.com/hotels/mn/tofte">Americinn</a> in <em>Tofte</em> is
across the highway from the lake and has a pool.</p>
<p>In <em>Grand Marais</em> , the Grand Marais Hotel Company manages <a href="http://www.gmhotel.net/portfolio">four
properties</a>, the Aspen Lodge and
Shoreline Inn, downtown, and the Spruceglen Inn and Aspen Inn on the
edge of town. The Shoreline is older but right on the water.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_cobblestone_villas.jpg" alt="Cobblestone Cove Villas in Grand Marais." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Cobblestone Cove Villas overlook the harbor in Grand Marais.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In <em>Grand Portage</em> , the <a href="http://www.grandportage.com/index.php/staying">Grand Portage
Lodge</a> &amp; Casino is right
on Lake Superior and has standard hotel rooms and five suites with
fireplaces and whirlpools. It also has a restaurant and indoor pool and
sauna.</p>
<p>The lodge and nearby <a href="http://www.hollowrockresort.com/cottage_rental.htm">Hollow Rock
Resort</a> are operated
by the Grand Portage Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. The resort includes
seven cabins.</p>
<p>They're very convenient for visiting Grand Portage National Monument
and High Falls on the Pigeon River and for catching the ferry to Isle
Royale National Park. Staff members also take guests to see the <a href="https://www.travisnovitsky.com/Lake-Superior/Spirit-Little-Cedar-Tree/">Little
Spirit Cedar
tree</a>.</p>
<h3>Bed-and-breakfast inns</h3>
<p>In <em>Two Harbors</em> , the <a href="https://lighthousebb.org/"><strong>Lighthouse B&amp;B</strong></a>
has three spare but tasteful rooms, and you can't beat the location,
since it's a real lighthouse. The rooms share one bathroom, and
there's a half-bath in the basement.</p>
<p>The Skiff House, on the grounds adjoining the visitors center, has its
own bathroom and hot tub.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/t/w/two_harbors_lighthouse.jpg" alt="Lighthouse B&B in Two Harbors" /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Lighthouse B&B in Two Harbors was built in 1892 and still operates
its beacon.

<p>The inn is run by volunteers from the historical society, 888-832-5606.
For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-minnesota/train-ride-two-harbor/">The Lighthouse
Express</a>.</p>
<h3>State-park lodgings</h3>
<p><em>Tettegouche State Park</em> has two highly prized places to stay. The
luxurious <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/tettegouche/illgen_falls_cabin.html">Illgen Falls
Cabin</a>
is atop 45-foot Illgen Falls on the Baptism River, off Minnesota 1.</p>
<p>It's disabled-accessible, and there's a swimming hole a short walk up
the river. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/state-park-cabins/">Cabin on a
waterfall</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/tettegouche/tettegouche_camp/index.html">Tettegouche
Camp</a>
is on the other side of the park, accessible only by a ¾-mile gravel
road over which guests must tote all their supplies. It includes four
rustic cabins on Mic Mac Lake. Cabin B is right on the lake and most
popular.</p>
<p>They share a wood-heated lodge and a heated shower house, and they're
as popular in winter as in summer.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/classic-cabins/tettegouche/">Heirs to a hideaway</a>.</p>

<h3>Camping</h3>
<p>There's camping at seven of the North Shore's eight state parks.
<a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/split_rock_lighthouse/index.html">Split Rock
Lighthouse</a>, which doesn't have very many sites, is the hardest-to-get
reservation in the state, with cart-in tent sites only.</p>
<p>If you want one, call 120 days in advance, the minute reservations
open.</p>
<p>No. 1 is a sunny but protected site that's off the trail; it's good
for campers with dogs who may bark at passersby. No. 2 and 3 are right
off the parking lot but on the trail, so they have less privacy.</p>
<p>No. 11 is right on the trail but pretty, tucked into the side of a
hill. No. 13 is not so protected but has a view of the lighthouse and a
cobblestone beach below it.</p>
<p>No. 16 is perhaps the most scenic
camping site in Minnesota, with a dead-on view of the lighthouse from a
bench perched at the edge of the cliff (and from the door of your tent).
It's also the best site if you're camping with friends; it shares a
spur from the trail with No. 17, which has a view nearly as good.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/split_rock_campsite16.jpg" alt="Campsite 16 at Split Rock." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Split Rock State Park, campsite 16 has its own bench facing the
lighthouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>No. 18 has a view and is large. No.
19 is a protected site on the corner of the headland and has a bench
with a view of the lighthouse. No. 20 is at the end of the trail and has
a view of the other side of the point.</p>
