People give you toys to play with. They show you new games and explain things in interesting ways. They feed you freshly baked cookies and s'mores. Kids take it for granted. But I didn't one January, when I got to stay at Deep Portage Learning Center, in the woods north of Brainerd.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/groups/deep-portage-center/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/nisswa-turtle-races/">Fast times in Nisswa</a></h2><h3>Speeding turtles mix with power shoppers in a Minnesota lake-country oasis.</h3><p>As soon as we turned off the highway into Nisswa, my children's heads began to swivel. "Souvenirs . . . Gift Shop . . . Moccasins,''  read my daughter Madeleine. "And look &mdash; Candy Store.'' "This is a cute town,'' said my son Peter, noticing the covered sidewalks.

What's it known for? Lakes, of course. And golf. It's not so known for its restaurants, but that may be because only locals know the best places.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-brainerd-lakes/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-brainerd-lakes-whitefish/">Dining up north: Pequot to Crosslake</a></h2><h3>Deep in Paul Bunyan country, we find the best lakeside supper clubs, roadhouses and bistros.</h3><p>North of moneyed Gull Lake, the Brainerd Lakes area starts to look more like traditional Minnesota resort country.

Today, it has more golf holes than fishing holes - and there are 465 lakes within 25 miles of Brainerd, a railroad town that lends  its name to a swath of north-central Minnesota that includes the lakeside villages of Nisswa, Breezy Point, Crosslake and Deerwood. Golf Digest has ranked the Brainerd Lakes one of the Top 50 golf destinations in the world, which is pretty good for real estate that spends most of the year under snow.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/golfing/brainerd-golf-guide/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/golfing/golfing-brainerd-best-bets/">Golfing the Brainerd Lakes: The Best Bets</a></h2><h3>Looking for a challenge, a place to take the family, a good deal?

It's more like a big pond, its vast surfaces dotted with powerboats, its depths thoroughly probed. A highway rings its 100 miles of shore, the better for boat access. Its air is laced with the perfume of gasoline, minnows and frying oil; the lake wouldn't be known as the Walleye Factory if it weren't.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/mille-lacs-lake-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/brainerd-nisswa-crosslake-winter/">Brainerd Lakes in winter</a></h2><h3>When this bustling lake resort area slows down, it's time for snowshoeing, sledding and saunas.</h3><p>In winter, the famous Brainerd Lakes freeze over, ice houses replace pontoon boats and skiers and snowmobilers ply the forests.  We hiked under bright-blue skies in a frosted forest, crossing bogs and watching for wildlife. And because we had time, we finally discovered something we'd bypassed dozens of times.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/brainerd-nisswa-crosslake-winter/">Go to story ...</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - 2022 all rights reserved</p></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
