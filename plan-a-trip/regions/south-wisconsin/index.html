Frank Lloyd Wright's story begins in the 1860s, when his unconventional grandparents and their 10 children emigrated from Wales to settle this dramatic valley of the Wisconsin River, which came to be known as "the valley of the God-almighty Joneses.'' The story of Alex Jordan's House on the Rock, atop a limestone spire that overlooks the valley and Wright's beloved home, is rooted in spite. After his father traveled from Madison to show Wright blueprints for a rooming house, and was harshly snubbed, Jordan vowed to get even and "put a Japanese house up out there.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/spring-green/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/wright-buildings-racine-wisconsin/">Wright in Racine</a></h2><h3>In southeast Wisconsin, a wax magnate's decision to hire 'the greatest architect in the world' had stunning results.</h3><p>Wherever he worked, Frank Lloyd Wright was good for a story.

In 1936, the grandson of the company's founder hired the flamboyant architect to design an Administration Building. "Don't make it too unconventional,'' H.F.

It grew into an empire that includes a five-diamond resort, a collection of upscale shops, an innovative art center, a foundation that rescues Wisconsin folk art and, in fact, an entire town that's so perfect it's almost eerie. That horse trough evolved, too, into such products as the Body Spa, a futuristic shower stall with a waterfall and 10 jets that pummel tired muscles with 80 gallons of water per minute.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/indulgent-retreats/kohler-wisconsin/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/caddie-woodlawn/">The first American Girl</a></h2><h3>Before Laura, before Kit, there was Caddie Woodlawn on the Wisconsin frontier.</h3><p>She came of age during the Civil War and loved the outdoors, gathering hazelnuts in the woods, dodging rattlesnakes on the bluff and poling a log raft on the lake.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/caddie-woodlawn/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/circus-world-baraboo/">Baraboo's gilt complex</a></h2><h3>In Ringlingville, the golden age of the circus never ended.</h3><p>In the circus, nothing succeeds like excess.

Anything would fire it up, especially tales of exploration: in dank, twisting caves; along rushing creeks shadowed by stone bluffs; on sun-kissed hilltops, with the world stretching out all around. And I loved the tales told by two real-life children's-book heroines: the resourceful tomboy Caddie Woodlawn, who roamed the wilderness of western Wisconsin during the Civil War, and Laura Ingalls Wilder, who relished life in the Big Woods above Lake Pepin before they became farmland. Western Wisconsin, it seems, has fired many young imaginations. One September, I took my own two children there, on a 185-mile tour with six spots that appeal particularly to kids.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/western-wisconsin-kids/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/new-glarus-wisconsin/">Swiss at heart</a></h2><h3>In Wisconsin's Little Switzerland, New Glarus hangs onto a colorful heritage.</h3><p>In a verdant little glen in southwest Wisconsin, the 13th century makes a reprise appearance every year.  It comes with pageantry, bloodshed and a whole lot of noble sentiments, courtesy of the 18th-century dramatist Friedrich Schiller. It also comes in German that's as meaty as the Landjaeger sausages sold to spectators.

Unnaturally still. Fifteen Union Army infantry units were camped around wagons in a meadow, near artillery and cavalry. Along a split-rail fence, a drum-and-fife corps pounded drums and blew trumpets. Gunners began to load their muskets. The cavalry got on pawing horses. Then a Union skirmish line marched down the meadow, followed by a tight column of infantrymen.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/civil-war-wade-house/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/stoughton-syttende-mai/">Syttende Mai in Stoughton</a></h2><h3>In May, everyone turns Norwegian in this southern Wisconsin town.</h3><p>In the small Wisconsin town of Stoughton, red, white and blue flags fly everywhere on Independence Day. Except here, the patriotic holiday is celebrated in May, and the flag is Norwegian, not American. Norway had been under Denmark's heel for more than 400 years when it signed a new democratic constitution on May 17, 1814, a day that became known as Syttende Mai.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/stoughton-syttende-mai/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/cornish-fest-mineral-point/">Cornish in Mineral Point</a></h2><h3>A fall festival honors the miners who left their mark on Mineral Point.</h3><p>The Cornish have been good to Mineral Point. In the 1830s, skilled tin miners from Cornwall, England, came to southwest Wisconsin, replacing the rough frontiersmen whose "badger'' digs gave the state a nickname but the town an unsavory atmosphere. "They'd start fights just for entertainment,'' said Lisa Kreul, a tour guide at the historic site Pendarvis.

They ran headlong into a slaughter that remains one of the most shameful chapters in U.S. history.

Yellow warblers zoomed down from trees and out of sight. Redwing blackbirds clung to cattails, swaying in the stiffening wind. It was only 6:30 a.m., but it was rush hour on the Horicon Marsh. A human here feels oddly out of place, a lumbering interloper on a fast-moving avian freeway.
