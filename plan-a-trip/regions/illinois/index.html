Of course, every year is a big year at the architect's first home and studio, which draws crowds of people from around the world even when it's not celebrating its 125th anniversary. People come to Oak Park for the sensational stories as well as the architecture. Wright was notoriously ill-behaved, breaking promises and scoffing at rules. He was a genius, and he knew it.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/wright-oak-park-chicago/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/best-chicago-trip-planning/">Chicago as you like it</a></h2><h3>Beaches or museums, baseball or music? This fun-loving metropolis makes it hard to decide what to do first.</h3><p>Chicago is like one big theme park. The thing is, you have to bring your own theme. I have one every time I go there: Blues and bicycling.  Museums and dim sum. Skyscrapers and food tours. That's because the possibilities are endless. There's so much to do in Chicago that it's easy to bounce around like a kid in a candy store, overwhelmed by choices, as time runs out.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/best-chicago-trip-planning/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/christmas-chicago/">Chicago at Christmas</a></h2><h3>During the holidays, this glittering, festive town becomes the City of Broad Smiles.</h3><p>Visiting Chicago during the holidays, I'm always  bowled over by how merry everyone is.

Chicago is a mosaic, a city of neighborhoods settled by waves of immigrants who arrived to dig its waterways, build its railroads and work in its slaughterhouses.  One of its first neighborhoods was Bridgeport, settled by Irish canal workers in the 1840s and the stronghold of Mayor Richard J. Daley and his son Richard M. Daley, the current mayor.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/ethnic-chicago/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/cheap-chicago/">Cheap Chicago</a></h2><h3>Here are 10 tips to make a trip affordable.</h3><p>These days, tourists have to compete with hordes of conventioneers and suburbanites fleeing back to the city.

Another woman sews the ticking for a straw mattress. Over an open fire, a man carefully pours molten lead into a mold, which he opens to reveal a shiny new musket ball.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/apple-river-fort-black-hawk/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/oregon-illinois-sightseeing/">On the Rock River in Illinois</a></h2><h3>In northwest Illinois, visitors follow in the famous footsteps of Black Hawk, Abraham Lincoln, John Deere and Ronald Reagan.</h3><p>In the northwest Illinois town of Oregon, a 48-foot concrete figure gazes over a river valley, arms folded. Over the years, it's been home to many ambitious men. Abraham Lincoln joined the militia here. John Deere forged the first steel plow. Ronald Reagan got his first lifeguard job. The man who inspired the gigantic blufftop statue also had an ambition: to keep this beautiful valley for his own people.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/american-indians/oregon-illinois-sightseeing/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/galena-ghost-tours/">Ghosts of Galena</a></h2><h3>This sweet town in northwest Illinois is packed with history . . . and mystery.</h3><p>In the northwest corner of Illinois,  there's no more cheerful place than Galena.  Eventually, demand for lead waned, and the river connecting Galena to the Mississippi filled with silt. The town went into a deep sleep until the 1960s, by which point it had become a virtual museum.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/galena-ghost-tours/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-geneva-st-charles-illinois/">Towns of the Fox River</a></h2><h3>An hour west of Chicago, a scenic bicycle trail links the towns of the Fox River.</h3><p>For centuries, people have beaten a path along the Fox River: Pottawatomie Indians, pioneer entrepreneurs, escaped slaves on the Underground Railroad,  city-bound commuters . . . and now, bicyclists. Thanks to a network of abandoned electric railways, this part of northeast Illinois is a hotbed of bicycle trails. They're all popular, but the 40-mile Fox River Trail past St. Charles, Geneva and Batavia includes an astonishing amount of scenery and attractions: a Dutch windmill, Japanese gardens and a lighthouse plus many forest preserves, gazebos and wildlife sightings, mainly herons and egrets lurking on the shallow river.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-geneva-st-charles-illinois/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/outdoors-sports-galena/">Outdoors in Galena</a></h2><h3>In an Illinois shopping town, tourists discover life beyond Main Street.</h3><p>So you've done Galena &mdash; the shopping, the wine-tasting, the trolley tours, the historic houses. What now? This mining town in northwest Illinois boomed, went bust and came back as a boutique town for urban weekenders. Now, it's returning to nature.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/outdoors-sports-galena/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/canoeing-chicago-river/">Paddling the Chicago River</a></h2><h3>After years of neglect, this urban waterway has become a place to play.</h3><p>The Chicago River never has run clear. Before settlers arrived, it was a lethargic prairie river that ran through a swamp the Potawatomi calledChecaugou &mdash; for "swamp weed,'' or "wild onion.'' Then factories and slaughterhouses turned it into a sewer. At the confluence of the main branch with the north and south branches, Bubbly Creek was named for the methane gas that rose from decomposing carcasses on the river bottom.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/canoeing-chicago-river/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurant-tours-chicago/">Chow-down in Chicago</a></h2><h3>In a city of neighborhoods, cooks from many countries stir the pot.</h3><p>Chicago has come a long way since it was hog butcher to the world. There was nothing very appetizing about early Chicago. The factories and slaughterhouses that made it grow also made it stink. Rotting carcasses made the Chicago River bubble; a glass of water came with a side of cholera. But the city grew up. The immigrants who packed its meat, dug its waterways and built its railroads moved on and were replaced by new immigrants, who settled in places that became known as Little Italy, Andersonville, Polish Village, Ukrainian Village, Chinatown, Greek Town and Pilsen.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurant-tours-chicago/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/galena-getaway/">Galena getaway</a></h2><h3>In northwest Illinois, this historic village is a favorite destination.</h3><p>In the grand scheme of things, Galena, Ill., was destined to be a flash in the pan.  The flash came from the shiny lead sulfide upon which the town's fortunes were built in the 1830s, '40s and '50s; galena is the Latin word for the ore.  It made many people rich, and in the 1850s, Galena, three miles from the Mississippi, was the busiest port between St. Paul and St. Louis.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/galena-getaway/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/halloween/graceland-cemetery-tours/">Tales of the dead</a></h2><h3>At Chicago's famous Graceland Cemetery, the graves have a lot to say.</h3><p>It isn't true that dead men tell no tales. Actually, they can be quite chatty. At Graceland Cemetery in Chicago, their stories keep up to seven tour guides busy, especially during Halloween season.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/halloween/graceland-cemetery-tours/">Go to story ...</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - <span id="cyear"></span>  all rights reserved</p><script>document.getElementById('cyear').innerText = new Date().getFullYear();</script></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
