<h2>In central Wisconsin, paddle down a scenic river and return on the 400 Trail.</h2>

<p>In Wisconsin's Driftless Area, the 400 Trail and Baraboo River go
together like ice cream and cones.</p>
<p>One is good. Both is better.</p>
<p>They follow each other for 22 miles, the trail only a few feet above the
river and its sloughs. Snapping turtles think the trail is a beach,
depositing their eggs into its crushed limestone, and fishermen walk the
trail to get to secret fishing holes.</p>
<p>This rather jungly corridor once was a long finger of the last glacier,
curling northward from Devil's Lake. When the ice receded, it left a
perfectly flat path for a railway.</p>
<p>The Chicago and North Western used it to run its best-known passenger
train, the Twin Cities 400, which traveled the 400 miles from Chicago to
Minneapolis in 400 minutes.</p>
<p>After the line was abandoned, the 400 became a state trail. Now bicycle
tourists zip along the trail, which is as straight as the river is
twisting. To get the full effect of both, many pedal one way and paddle
the other.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Wisconsin's 2,000 miles of rail trails often follow rivers, so it's
easy to make a loop by paddling downstream and returning by bicycle. The
Baraboo has two good stretches, one between Union Center and Wonewoc,
and a longer one between La Valle and Reedsburg.</p>
<p>Why do just one fun thing when you can do two?</p>
<p>My friend Sue Ann always is up for an adventure, so she met me at the
midpoint of the trail, Wonewoc, whose slogan is &quot;We're user
friendly.&quot;</p>
<p>It is, too. The last time I rode through the town, I was invited to an
ice-cream social in the bakery, where I paid $1.25 to have coffee and a
superb piece of blackberry pie with a trio of sunburned farmers.</p>
<p>This time, I came away with a long john, a chocolate cake doughnut, two
twists and a large milk for $2.75, first checking to make sure the
friendly baker hadn't made a mistake.</p>
<p>This is why city folks love small-town Wisconsin — one of the reasons,
anyway.</p>

<p>We left our bikes at Wonewoc's canoe landing in the Lost District,
named because so few traces remain of the many tanneries and mills
powered by the local dam, removed in 1996. It took the removal of four
more dams, but in 2001, the Baraboo River finally ran free.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our take-out was just a sloping slick of mud.</p>
<p>So was the put-in at Union Center, but a mat covered the mud. Sue Ann
slid me into the river in my kayak, then did a daring seal launch
herself that was . . . almost successful.</p>
<p>Not only did she get wet, she discovered the lovely clay mud that early
settlers dug out of the sloughs and used to make bricks for their
downtowns.</p>
<p>Wearing a good bit of it herself, she pumped out her boat and then set
herself to wildlife spotting, noting many places where animals, like
her, had tumbled down the muddy banks.</p>
<p>First we saw a muskrat, watching it glide among the tree roots before it
found a den. Then we rounded a corner and glided right into a gaggle of
geese and ducks.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>The ducks immediately zigzagged downstream, and their babies skittered
off like windup toys. But the big geese started honking indignantly and
the goslings bobbed up and down in the water, leaving one mud-covered
brother behind.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not going to lie; I'm kind of scared of those parents,&quot; Sue
Ann said.</p>
<p>Whole trees had toppled into the river from low banks, but it wasn't
hard to paddle around them in the lazy current. This narrow, winding
stretch of the Baraboo is a lot like the Kickapoo, but with fewer rock
outcroppings — until you get to Third Castle.</p>
<p>Once, this massive, 150-foot sandstone bluff was an island in the
glacial lake, which eroded it into what early settlers imagined as
parapets and battlements.</p>
<p>On this muggy day, it was an island emanating cool, cave-scented air,
and we lingered at its feet. Baby ferns grew on its face, and white pine
and hemlock in its shadow.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/w/o/wonewoc_trail.jpg" alt="400 Trail in Wonewoc." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It wasn't far from there to Wonewoc, and, feeling guilty about Sue
Ann's mud bath, I volunteered to drag us up the take-out. But while we
were paddling, the elves from Beyond Boundaries outfitters in Wonewoc
had mowed the grass, shoveled off the muck that had hidden concrete
steps and covered them with a mat.</p>
<p>So, after a dip into my bag of doughnuts, Sue Ann and I got on our bikes
and headed up the trail. As we left, a bachelorette party from Cross
Plains got ready to take our places on the river.</p>
<p>It seemed as if we got to Union Center in a flash — it's only four
miles by trail, 5½ by river — so we headed west on the spur trail to
Hillsboro, Wisconsin's Czech capital.</p>
<p>It was celebrating Cesky Den, or Czech Day, so we rode over to the
fairgrounds to listen to some polka and have ourselves some pork
sandwiches and poppyseed cake. Beer, too — and luckily, we both picked
the &quot;Hillsboro Pale Ale by Snapper Verbsky,&quot; because the
linebacker-sized Verbsky was right there serving it.</p>
<p>Turns out Verbsky is the brewer at the new Hillsboro Brewing Co., and a
genial kind of guy. He told us Hillsboro still is Czech, more or less.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>&quot;It's kind of diluted now,&quot; he said. &quot;But the old families are still
here.&quot;</p>
<p>On the way back, we stopped to investigate two men poking around in the
brush along the trail — maybe for morels, we thought. But they were
geocachers, racking up finds.</p>
<p>Steve Haas of Holmen told us he's the No. 1 cacher in Wisconsin but has
fallen to No. 21 from No. 13 worldwide. So he and friend Mark Gullickson
of West Salem were on the Hillsboro State Trail because it's a Power
Trail, with more than three dozen caches along the four-mile trail.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh you bet, it's all about the numbers,&quot; Haas said.</p>
<p>&quot;Some biker probably did this one,&quot; Gullickson added.</p>
<p>Back in Wonewoc, we stopped at Beyond Boundaries to thank the owners for
cleaning up the take-out and to look around the century-old feed mill.
Miah Jones and his wife, Brandi Pollard-Jones, both certified kayak
instructors, opened their outfitting business there in 2008.</p>

Near Union Center, the Baraboo River is narrow and twisting.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>&quot;We didn't pick it; it picked us,&quot; Jones said. &quot;We had a house in
Reedsburg, and we were riding by and fell in love with the building.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, they're the ones who keep up the river, not only maintaining the
landings but clearing deadfall and detritus, so paddlers don't get
snagged.</p>
<p>People come from all over to paddle. And oddly, says Pollard-Jones,
about a quarter of their business comes from people in Minneapolis and
Chicago who want a place where they can meet halfway.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of them are online dating, or friends, and there's biking and
lots of other things they can do, too,&quot; she says.</p>
<p>Turns out the old 400 line still is on track after all these years.</p>
