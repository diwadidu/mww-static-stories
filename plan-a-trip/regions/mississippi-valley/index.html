In Fountain City, all is not as it seems. A Hindu temple sits amid hay fields. One of the world's largest collections of toy pedal cars occupies five barns on a bluff.

Sent by a general who was a double agent for Spain, 26-year-old Lt. Zebulon Pike was assigned to find sites for forts, determine the source of the Mississippi, make peace between warring tribes and stop unlicensed British trade on land just acquired by the Americans.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/zebulon-pike/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/heritage-travel/stockholm-lake-pepin/">Destination: Stockholm</a></h2><h3>Once the promised land, this Lake Pepin village now is a favorite day trip.</h3><p>Once, people went through hell to get to Stockholm, Wis.

They tend to stare off into space. They often stop talking mid-sentence. It's hard to finish  conversations with them.  But their enthusiasm for nature is contagious. And in spring, birders know all the best places to go.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/birding-tiffany-wildlife-area/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagle-watching-mississippi-river/">Where eagles land</a></h2><h3>Winter is anything but slow at the big birds' favorite gathering spots in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa and Illinois.</h3><p>Eagles don't really have lovable personalities. But, man, are they fun to watch. Everything about them is larger than life, right down to their nests, which are so big and sturdy that bears sometimes climb into them to hibernate.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagle-watching-mississippi-river/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagles-wabasha/">All eyes on Wabasha</a></h2><h3>Eagles are drawn to this Mississippi River town, along with flocks of binocular-toting visitors.</h3><p>Eagles reappeared slowly after DDT was banned in 1972, and one of the first places they could be seen was in this Minnesota town, just downriver from the mouth of the Chippewa River, which kept water open in winter so eagles could fish. The city built a deck downtown and staffed it with spotting scopes and volunteers from November through March.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/eagles-wabasha/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/mississippi-winter/">Open sesame on the sloughs</a></h2><h3>In winter, explore frozen Mississippi byways around Wabasha, Alma, Trempealeau, La Crosse and Genoa.</h3><p>For people who love nature, winter is a time of opportunity. When it's cold enough, you can walk onto the Mississippi River. You can see bald eagles up close. You can explore sloughs and backwaters without being eaten alive by insects. "Most of these places, you'd almost die in a few minutes in summer," says Scott Mehus, education specialist at the National Eagle Center in Wabasha.

Bird-watchers, especially. On chilly days in late fall, they crowd onto wooden platforms to watch tundra swans paddling around sloughs of the Mississippi River.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/tundra-swans-alma/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/where-to-find-eagles/">Looking for bald eagles</a></h2><h3>In winter, the cold forces the birds to go where they're easier to see.</h3><p>If you want to find eagles, the most important thing to know is they work only as hard as they have to. Wabasha, Minn. "They're still trying to decide where to spend the winter," says Pat Manthey of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/where-to-find-eagles/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/morel-mushrooms/">Searching for morels</a></h2><h3>When days get warmer, mushroom hunters get ready to root out the wily morel.</h3><p>Deep down, every morel hunter believes in divine providence. There's nothing so providential as baskets overflowing with morels, and the taste is so divine hunters dream about it all winter. In spring, they offer a fervent prayer to the mushroom gods: May the fungus be among us. Morels do taste heavenly. But it's the hunt that's so addictive &mdash; it's fun to find something for free that's so expensive in stores and restaurants, and it's fun to beat the odds by finding something so notoriously elusive.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/morel-mushrooms/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/wildflowers-bluff-country/">Road trip: Wildflowers of the Mississippi Valley</a></h2><h3>A spring quest leads through Minnesota bluff country and Wisconsin river towns.</h3><p>In May, the woods are full of people on the hunt. Some are stalking morel mushrooms. Others are trying to bag a turkey or spot a rare warbler. The rest of us are content to chase wildflowers. For one thing, we're guaranteed success.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/wildflowers-bluff-country/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/great-river-trail/">Bikes, birds and bogs</a></h2><h3>Between Trempealeau and Onalaska, cyclists encounter a happy mix of wildlife and civilization.</h3><p>The pelicans and cormorants of the Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge are used to train whistles and the distant popping of trap guns. But they're even more used to the whir of bicycle gears.  Here, the 24-mile Great River State Trail starts in the refuge, skirts Perrot State Park and goes through the river town of Trempealeau before entering the Upper Mississippi River Wildlife and Fish Refuge and then the prairie outside Onalaska.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/great-river-trail/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/skiing-winona/">Skiing in southeast Minnesota</a></h2><h3>Snowstorms that blanket the southern woods bring skiers with them.</h3><p>Sometimes, skiers have a hard time figuring out Mother Nature. It's supposed to snow across northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, but often, storms have veered to the south instead. It's odd, but what can you do? You have to go with the snow. One year, at the end of February, my friend Becky and I were just about to make the long drive to the snowy Upper Peninsula of Michigan when the southeast Minnesota town of Winona got blanketed with 30 inches.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/skiing-winona/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Trails of Trempealeau</a></h2><h3>There's a lot to do in this Mississippi River hamlet in southwest Wisconsin.</h3><p>All kinds of paths cross in the Wisconsin village of Trempealeau. Canoes and cormorants, tugboats and trains, bicyclists and blues fans all are drawn toward this Mississippi River town.  It's just a little burg, but it's smack in the middle of Mother Nature's playground.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/trempealeau-trails/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/cruises-in-lacrosse/">Cruising La Crosse</a></h2><h3>These days, the riverfront is an even bigger draw than the bars.</h3><p>We'd been in La Crosse for barely an hour, and everyone we'd met was a certified character. In Riverside Park, Frank and Faith Rimmert and Jonathan and Barb Rimmert were decked out in top hats, waistcoats and crinolines to meet the Mississippi Queen paddlewheeler, portraying the 19th-century locals who would have assembled. "If your relatives were coming for a visit, you'd come to greet them," said Faith Rimmert, a volunteer for the La Crosse County Historical Society. "People picked up things being shipped in, or maybe you'd be looking for a servant &mdash; you'd say, 'I want that person for a servant in my house.'"</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/cruises-in-lacrosse/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mississippi-river-views/">Mississippi panoramas</a></h2><h3>Take in the views from 500 feet above the famous river. </h3><p>For centuries, blufftop views of the Mississippi have inspired superlatives. Jonathan Carver called the view from Barn Bluff  "the most beautiful prospect that imagination can form.'' Stephen Long said, "The sublime and beautiful (are) here blended in the most enchanting manner.'' Those early explorers embellished their speech to impress folks back home. Nowadays, most people who take in the scenery just say "Wow.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mississippi-river-views/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Roaming in Red Wing</a></h2><h3>A scenic Mississippi River town is a magnet for tourists and day-trippers from the Twin Cities.</h3><p>For many years, Red Wing has been Twin Citians' favorite day-trip destination. It's adorable, with its brick storefronts, flowering planters hung from lampposts and rows of stately Victorian houses in three historic districts. Sitting on a sharp elbow of the Mississippi, it's a small town that still looks the part &mdash; it has a bakery, a barber shop, a homespun caf&eacute; &mdash; and it was the first Minnesota town on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's list of Distinctive Destinations.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/red-wing-minnesota-sightseeing/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/winona-minnesota-fun/">Afloat in Winona</a></h2><h3>Beneath the surface, a town along the Mississippi River moves fast.</h3><p>For a river town that has everything going for it, Winona is a little hard for a tourist to get to know. Those who venture off U.S. 61 find a downtown that's long, spread out and a little forlorn on weekends. To find its Mississippi riverfront, they have to cut across train tracks and around a concrete levee wall.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/winona-minnesota-fun/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/driving-lake-pepin/">A spin around Lake Pepin</a></h2><h3>On the Mississippi River between Wisconsin and Minnesota, a favorite driving route leads to some real treats.</h3><p>Along the shores of Lake Pepin, villages like to play a game called "Tempt the Tourist." The tourists think they're going to go for a drive and see some scenery. But the villages give them so many places to indulge themselves, they end up mostly eating and shopping &mdash; not that anyone's complaining.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/driving-lake-pepin/">Go to story ...</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - <span id="cyear"></span>  all rights reserved</p><script>document.getElementById('cyear').innerText = new Date().getFullYear();</script></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
