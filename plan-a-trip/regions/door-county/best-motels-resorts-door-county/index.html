<p>If you think it's expensive to stay in Wisconsin's Door County, you
haven't looked very hard.</p>
<p>In early June, rates can be almost ludicrously low, cheaper than a Super
8. And even on weekends in July and August, it's not hard to find a
decent place for $100 or less if you book in advance.</p>
<p>The Door Peninsula's breezy beaches are the place to be when the rest
of the region is sweltering. During one early June heat wave,
temperatures there were 20 to 40 degrees lower, and lodging rates were
low, too — I got three nights for the price of two.</p>
<p>That was a great value, but so was the $29.50 campsite surrounded by
cedars and the $99 condo-resort studio with fireplace, whirlpool and
balcony.</p>
<p>Many would-be visitors to Door County are overwhelmed by the choices,
and no wonder. There are no Marriotts, but dozens of family-run motels.
There are dozens more condo complexes and B&amp;Bs, but only a few
traditional lake resorts.</p>
<p>Because there are so many places to stay, proprietors are acutely aware
that if their lodgings don't measure up, tourists will go elsewhere.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>This ensures a high level of professionalism on the peninsula, including
in the small mom-and-pop motels in which many people hesitate to stay in
elsewhere.</p>
<p>Of the 32 lodgings I toured on a June trip, 31 were perfectly pleasant
(and the other had just changed managers).</p>
<p>The little motels seemed a particularly good deal; all of the ones I saw
had clean, tidy rooms on grounds that almost always featured shade
trees, hanging baskets of flowers and beds of perennials.</p>
<p>Here's a guide to finding a great place to stay in Door County.</p>
<p>But first, a guide to help you decide <em>where</em> to stay — Fish Creek, Sister Bay,
Baileys Harbor? Each village has a different character, and it's fun to
visit them all.</p>
<p>You don't want to spend all your time getting in and out of the car, so
try to stay where you can walk or bike to shops, restaurants and
beaches.</p>
<p>For details, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/best-door-county-vacation/">Door County 101</a>.</p>

In Fish Creek, the White Gull Inn was built in 1896.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>When to go</h3>
<p>The waters of Lake Michigan keep the peninsula cooler than the rest of
Wisconsin in spring and early summer and warmer in fall.</p>
<p>You can get great lodging rates in May and the first two weeks of June,
when the lilacs are blooming but there's not much going on. Rates at
motels go as low as $50, and you can get a room at a condo resort for
less than $100, especially midweek.</p>
<p>In July and the first half of August, every village has free outdoor
concerts, and there's a lot going on — festivals, naturalist hikes,
plays, tours. Lodging rates are highest then, and generally the same
midweek as on weekends.</p>
<p>Rates start to go down the third week of August, when schoolchildren
have to return home. In September, which most locals think is the best
month in Door County, the weather is good but the crowds are gone.</p>
<p>The first three weekends of October are very crowded, with Ephraim's
Townline Art Fair, Egg Harbor's Pumpkin Patch Festival and Sister
Bay's Fall Festival.</p>
<p>If you don't care about catching a festival, midweek is a good time to
come in fall.</p>

County</a>, <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/door-county-fall/">Fall

<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Looking for a room</h3>
<p>From home, look over websites and call owners if you have questions.</p>
<p>When you're in the area and you see a place you like, stop and look it
over — the staff will be happy to let you see a room if one is vacant.</p>
<p>Lodgings on the water and with views of water cost most. If you want to
save money, remember that you can stay off the water but spend your days
at the many public beaches and waterfront parks. There are also many
public tennis courts.</p>
<h3>Reserving</h3>
<p>If you can go in May, June, late August or September, especially
midweek, check websites for an inn that offers a good deal. Some inns
are good values in some time periods but not as good in others. Room tax
adds 5.5 percent.</p>
<p>Except for holiday weekends and the first three weekends in October, you
can arrive without a reservation and ask for help at visitor centers.
However, you may not get the type of lodgings or the price you want.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/p/ephraim_pioneer_lane.jpg" alt="Lodgings at Pioneer Lane in Ephraim." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Lodgings at Pioneer Lane are suites in Ephraim.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>It's always best to reserve in advance by phone, especially if you're
picky or demanding. Owners don't want unhappy guests and will tell you
if their place isn't right for you.</p>
<p>Below are the lodgings I visited that offer a <em>good value and/or are among
the few available of their type</em> .</p>
<p>Of course, these are only a small fraction of the places available.
There's a particularly large supply of newer condo resorts, which tend
to have a fairly generic upscale decor and standard set of amenities.</p>
<p>You'll find <em>more good places to stay</em> listed at the <a href="http://doorcounty.com/where-to-stay">Door County
tourism site</a>, which allows you to
search by town as well as type of lodging desired.</p>
<p>It also shows lodgings where <em>pets</em> are allowed and rooms are available
for the <em>disabled</em> .</p>
<h3>Mom-and-pop motels</h3>
<p>Nearly every Door County motel room offers cable, a refrigerator and a
pair of chairs on a shaded walkway; many also have a microwave and offer
morning coffee and sweet rolls.</p>
<p>Some rooms have WiFi, flat-screen TVs and private balconies or patios.
Decor may be a little dated, but most proprietors continually are
updating their rooms to appeal to modern tastes. If you like, you can
ask for a room that's been recently renovated.</p>
<p>Like B&amp;Bs, they have the advantage of being operated by their owners.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/f/i/fish_creek_robins_nest.jpg" alt="Robins Nest Cottages in Fish Creek." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

This motel, tucked into the foot of the
bluff on the south end of downtown, is close to everything and
beautifully landscaped and maintained.</p>
<p>The second-floor rooms in the century-old building facing Highway 42 are
cheapest but also most exposed to weekend noise from nearby bars. But
there are also rooms in five other buildings, including the cottage-like
14, which has a wrap-around deck.</p>
<p>High-energy manager Kathy Brady loves the outdoors and can give guests
tips on little-known hiking trails and parks.</p>

Michigan's North Bay, halfway between Baileys Harbor and Ephraim/Sister

reminiscent of Catskills resorts as shown in the movie &quot;Dirty
Dancing.&quot; Its Hof restaurant is open to the public.</p>
<p>The Alpine is for social people who enjoy a vintage atmosphere. Lodge
rooms are old-fashioned, and there are also guesthouses and rows of
cottages named after states. It has a 36-hole golf course nearby.</p>
<h3>Cottage resorts</h3>
<p>Most small resorts rent by the week in the peak season.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/g/egg_harbor_lodge.jpg" alt="Egg Harbor Lodge." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<h3>Cottage resorts on the water</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.europelakecottages.com/">Smith's Europe Lake

location of these four vintage cottages is very special — they're on
Europe Lake, separated from Lake Michigan only by a sliver of Newport
State Park.</p>

on the lake and have fieldstone fireplaces inside and log swings and
fire rings outside. Two chinked-timber cabins, one with a wood-burning

<p>Travel Wisconsin recommends even <a href="http://www.travelwisconsin.com/article/cabins-cottages/door-county-cabins-and-cottages">more
cottages</a>.</p>
<h3>B&amp;B inns</h3>
<p>B&amp;Bs don't offer as many pricing tiers as motels and resorts, so
generally, they're not as good a deal on weekdays or the shoulder
seasons of late spring and late fall. In peak season, however, rates are
competitive.</p>
<p>In the off season, check websites for specials, such as a third night
free or dinner with a stay of two nights.</p>
<p>The inns below have especially fine locations, but many others are
available.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/p/ephraim_edgewater.jpg" alt="Waterfront hotel in Ephraim." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>There are two bathhouses, and nature-loving owners Cheri Ault and Dick
Bartlett make sure guests know about the quiet policy. There's also a
store, playground and playing field.</p>
<p>The four state parks also have camping. <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/newport/">Newport State
Park</a>, Wisconsin's only
wilderness park, has some rustic sites that are walk-in but gorgeous:
Backpack Sites 14 and 16, on Lake Michigan and a stone's throw from
Europe Lake.</p>
<p>For more conventional camping, try <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/peninsula/">Peninsula State
Park</a>, where sites are
the state's most coveted, or <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/potawatomi/">Potawatomi State
Park</a> in Sturgeon Bay.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/rockisland/">Rock Island State Park</a>
has campsites on lovely beaches, but access requires two ferry
crossings. For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/rock-island-state-park-wisconsin/">Wisconsin's Icelandic
outpost</a>.</p>
<p>As at all Wisconsin state-park sites, sites can be
<a href="https://wisconsin.goingtocamp.com/">reserved</a> up to 11 months in
advance.</p>
<h3>Cottages</h3>
<p>The Door County tourism site lists <a href="https://www.doorcounty.com/stay/cottage-house/">cottages and
houses</a>. <a href="http://www.rentdoorcounty.com/">Rent Door
County</a> also lists cottages, as do
Airbnb, VRBO, HomeAway and other listing services.</p>
