<h2>Want to check out this popular peninsula? Here's everything you need to plan a visit.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/b/a/baileys_harbor_cana.jpg" alt="Cana Island Lighthouse near Baileys Harbor." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Near Baileys Harbor, people walk over a causeway to visit the 1870 Cana
Island Lighthouse.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Around the Upper Midwest, Door County is the tourist destination that
other tourist destinations envy.</p>
<p>Everything a tourist loves, it's got: Lighthouses and sand dunes.
Wineries and boutiques. Bicycle paths and beaches.</p>
<p>There's a little bit of New England in the white-frame buildings of
Ephraim, where tourists click photos of Wilson's, a century-old
ice-cream parlor.</p>
<p>There's a little bit of Europe in Sister Bay, where goats graze on the
sod roof of Al Johnson's Swedish Restaurant. There's not much that isn't
picturesque.</p>
<p>Of course, things can get a little hectic, a little crowded. Door County
has been discovered.</p>
<p>Here's what you need to know about visiting Wisconsin's favorite
peninsula.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<h3>Getting there</h3>
<p>Door County starts just north of Algoma, but the Sturgeon Bay Ship Canal
creates the Door Peninsula.</p>
<p>Sturgeon Bay is 45 miles from the city of Green Bay, 150 miles from
Milwaukee, 240 miles from Chicago and 320 miles from Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The first town on the Green Bay side, Egg Harbor, is 17 miles from
Sturgeon Bay. Fish Creek is seven miles from Egg Harbor and adjacent to
Ephraim, which blends into Sister Bay.</p>
<p>Sister Bay is six miles from Ellison Bay, and it's another six miles to
Northport and the ferry to Washington Island.</p>
<p>Baileys Harbor is the biggest town on the Lake Michigan side. It's 10
miles over from Egg Harbor.</p>
<h3>When to go</h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/i/sister_bay_beach.jpg" alt="The swimming pier at Sister Bay." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The beach in Sister Bay is a popular place to swim.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>The whole month of July, the first three weeks of August and weekends in
October are very busy. Reserve far in advance.</p>
<p>May and the first three weeks of June are a great time to see
wildflowers and get good deals on hotels. In late May and early June,
see the rare wildflowers at Ridges Sanctuary near Baileys Harbor and at
the 28 <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/Lands/naturalareas/">state natural
areas</a> in Door County.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/wildflowers/door-county-wildflowers/">Spring in Door
County</a>.</p>
<p>Hotel rates start to go down in mid-August, and weekdays in September
and October are very pleasant. Locals say September is the best month.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/fall-color/door-county-fall/">Fall in Door
County</a>.</p>
<h3>Where to stay</h3>
<p>There are hundreds of hotels, motels, condos and inns, and a few cabins
and cottages. The <a href="http://doorcounty.com/where-to-stay">county website</a>
can help you choose.</p>
<p>For our list of some good values, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/door-county/best-motels-resorts-door-county/">Where to stay in Door
County</a>.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>There's also camping in four state parks and private campgrounds.</p>
<p>Sites at <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/peninsula/">Peninsula State
Park</a> are the most
coveted in Wisconsin. It's almost like a resort; the park includes
beaches, bicycle trails, a professional theater and a golf course, and
it's adjacent to the shopping and restaurants in Fish Creek and
Ephraim. <a href="https://wisconsin.goingtocamp.com/">Reserve</a> the minute the
window opens, 11 months in advance.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/newport/">Newport State Park</a> is
Wisconsin's only wilderness park. It has beautiful walk-in sites that
are on Lake Michigan and stone's throw from Europe Lake.</p>
<p>In Sturgeon Bay, <a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/Potawatomi/">Potawatomi State
Park</a> has a campground
on the bay and also an accessible cabin for people with disabilities.
The park is the eastern trailhead of the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/iatr/index.htm">Ice Age National Scenic
Trail</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://dnr.wi.gov/topic/parks/name/rockisland/">Rock Island State Park</a>
has 40 campsites on lovely beaches, 10 miles of hiking trails, a
lighthouse and a unique stone &quot;boathouse.&quot; Access requires two ferry
crossings.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/parks-natural-areas/rock-island-state-park-wisconsin/">Wisconsin's Icelandic
outpost</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Which town?</strong></h3>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/p/ephraim_village_hall.jpg" alt="The Village Hall in Ephraim." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A horse-drawn carriage passes Ephraim's Village Hall.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/sturgeon-bay/">Sturgeon
Bay</a></strong> is a
fun place to stay in itself, but it's not the best base to see the rest
of the peninsula: From there, it's 17 miles on the Green Bay side to
the next town, Egg Harbor, and 41 miles to the last town, Gills Rock.</p>
<p>For many people, <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/egg-harbor-door-county/">Egg
Harbor</a></strong>
is the &quot;first&quot; village. You'll see bistros and boutiques as you drive
through, but it's also got a lovely little hillside park that overlooks
the marina and is perfect for a picnic.</p>
<p>Its town beach, with changing rooms and a playground, could be the
nicest on the peninsula.</p>
<p>All of the villages are on harbors and have marinas and waterfront
parks. From Egg Harbor, it's seven miles to <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/fish-creek-door-county/">Fish
Creek</a></strong>
, which has even more shops on its south end.</p>
<p>Peninsula State Park separates Fish Creek from
<a href="http://www.ephraim-doorcounty.com/">Ephraim</a>. This town has a New
England feel, with a row of white-frame hotels that face the harbor, a
favorite spot to stroll and watch the sunset.</p>
<p>The hill between Ephraim and Sister Bay is lined with tourist
businesses. <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/sister-bay-door-county/">Sister
Bay</a></strong>
has the peninsula's longest public beach and waterfront park and a
Piggly Wiggly supermarket and shops on the hill above the harbor.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/d/o/door_county_fish_boil.jpg" alt="A Door County fish boil." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
During a fish boil, kerosene is added to the pot when the fish and
potatoes are done, causing the water to boil over, carrying away fish
oils and dousing flames.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Its waterfront park is across from Al Johnson's Restaurant, famous for
the goats grazing on its sod roof.</p>
<p>Sister Bay is  a good base if you like the more outdoorsy north end of
the peninsula. From there, it's nine miles south to <strong><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/baileys-harbor-door-county/">Baileys
Harbor</a></strong>
on Lake Michigan, the cooler side.</p>
<p>Kiteboarders like Baileys Harbor's wide sand beach. It's across the
road from the old range lights on the grounds of Ridges Sanctuary, a
wonderful place to hike and look for wildflowers. The trip to nearby
Cana Island lighthouse is a popular bicycle ride.</p>
<p>Back on the Green Bay side of the peninsula, it's six miles to <strong>Ellison
Bay</strong> from Sister Bay.</p>
<p>From this quiet village, home of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/learning-vacations/clearing-classes-door-county/">The Clearing folk
school</a>, it's five miles to <strong>Gills Rock</strong>, where
you can catch the Island Clipper to <a href="http://washingtonisland-wi.com/">Washington
Island</a>, and another two miles to the
car ferry at Northport.</p>
<p>From Ellison Bay, Newport State Park and Europe Bay beach are five miles
east on Lake Michigan, and Rowleys Bay and the Mink River Estuary, a
favorite kayak destination, are five miles southeast.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/p/ephraim_wilsons.jpg" alt="Wilson's ice-cream parlor in Ephraim." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
In Ephraim, Wilson's ice-cream parlor is a landmark.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3>Where to eat</h3>
<p>Door County has many fine restaurants, pizzerias, delis and barbecue
joints.</p>
<p>But at some point, every tourist has to go to a fish boil. These outdoor
meals are are the Door version of a lutefisk feed, a humble peasant
repast that, through the years, has acquired a folkloric cachet.</p>
<p>One of the best places to have one is at Rowleys Bay Resort, where the
boilmaster adds theater and history to the pot, along with potatoes,
onions and fish. Dessert usually is cherry pie, another Door tradition.</p>
<p>The Viking Grill in Ellison Bay and Pelletier's and White Gull Inn in
Fish Creek also are good places to go for fish boils.</p>
<p>Other tourist favorites: Many people like to get a cone from Wilson's,
the 1906 ice-cream parlor in Ephraim. If you have children, get frozen
custard from Not Licked Yet in Fish Creek, which has a small playground
along the creek.</p>
<p>In Sister Bay, eat Swedish pancakes at Al Johnson's, though there's
always a line. And be sure to stop at one of the many farm markets to
stock up on freshly made doughnuts, cherry cider coolers and berry pie.</p>

State Park and Ephraim.

<p>With its many quiet country roads, Door County is a great place to
<em>bicycle</em> , and there are <em><strong>hiking</strong></em> trails in state parks and 28
state natural areas.</p>
<p>Outfitters offer <em><strong>kayaking</strong></em> tours, and the larger towns have a city
beach for <em>swimming</em> .</p>
<p>There are a dozen scenic places to <em><strong>golf</strong></em> , including the historic
course that overlooks Eagle Harbor in <a href="http://www.peninsulagolf.org/">Peninsula State

<p>Along Door County's 300 miles of shoreline, three <em><strong>lighthouses</strong></em> can
be toured all summer, and four others are easily seen. And three can be
reached only during Door County Maritime Museum's annual Lighthouse
Festival in June.</p>
<p>For more, see <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/lighthouses/door-county-lighthouses/">Lighthouses of Door

<p>From the many marinas, you can choose any kind of <em><strong>cruise</strong></em> — power
boats, pontoon, sailboat — or fishing charter.</p>
<p>Two of the best cruises are from Sister Bay, on the 65-foot schooner
Edith M. Becker and Shoreline Charters' water taxi. Captains on both
provide running commentary on the scenery and history of the area.</p>

<p>Many people like to go on tasting tours of the eight <em><strong>wineries</strong></em>
along the <a href="http://www.doorcountywinetrail.com/">Door County Wine Trail</a>.</p>
<p>And for <em><strong>tours</strong></em> , hop on one of the bright-red trolleys of <a href="https://doorcountytrolley.com/">Door
