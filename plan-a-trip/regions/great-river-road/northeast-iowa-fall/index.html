<h2>The roller-coaster hills and riverside bluffs of northeast Iowa yield a photo album of panoramas.</h2>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/guttenberg_riverfront_shop.jpg" alt="Buildings in Guttenberg, Iowa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Much of Guttenberg was built before the Civil War.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Long before the second-growth forests of Minnesota and Wisconsin's north
woods became fall destinations, sightseers were flocking to northeast
Iowa.</p>
<p>Flat? Hardly. In this part of Iowa, only the river is flat. Towering
bluffs line the Mississippi, providing unparalleled views of the
sprawling river plain.</p>
<p>For more than 150 years, people have gone to great lengths to see these
views. In 1851, when the town of
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/lansing/">Lansing</a>
consisted of a few log
cabins, a 20-year-old steamboat passenger named Harriet Hosmer noticed a
particularly steep bluff there.</p>
<p>She asked the captain, who had stopped to take on wood, if she had time
to climb it and, when he sent a clerk to escort her, easily beat him in
a race to the bluff top. The peak has been called Mount Hosmer ever
since.</p>
<p>Young Hattie never came back to Lansing; she finished her art studies in
St. Louis and went on to Rome, where she became a renowned sculptor and
joined an international circle of artists that included novelist
Nathaniel Hawthorne, who modeled one of his characters after her.</p>
<p>Hosmer's bluff, however, has been giving a spectacular front-row seat to
tourists ever since.</p>
<p>It's just one of the splendid views along this stretch of the
Mississippi, but it may be the best. From Lansing's Main Street, Sixth
Street climbs a nearly vertical hillside, past ornate Victorian houses.</p>
<p>Creep still higher and around a few hairpin curves, and you'll see a
three-state panorama, including the lacy Black Hawk Bridge and, far
below, a labyrinth of islands and sloughs, through which trains inch
across dikes, barges push tons of grain, and houseboats putter into
marshy corners.</p>
<p>The view is rivaled only by the one from the 500-foot bluffs of Pikes
Peak State Park, farther down the river. This part of Iowa not only
isn't flat, it's as wavy as a windsock.</p>
<p>In fall especially, tourists beat a path to this corner of Iowa, to
follow the river and explore towns that hit their heyday during the
Civil War. There's no way to get here that's not extremely scenic.</p>
<p>The rolling countryside is at least as beautiful as the riverside,
punctuated by old stone churches tucked into the nape of hillsides and
an occasional round barn.</p>
<p>In autumn, cotton grass waves in the breeze, and limestone outcroppings
became tawny in the slanting sunlight.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/u/guttenburg_fall_tree.jpg" alt="Maples on the Mississippi in Guttenberg, Iowa." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Sugar maples along Guttenberg's mile-long city park provide a wave of
color in fall.

<p>Those driving in from the north will arrive in the border town of New
Albin. Those coming from the west, through the bluff-country burg of
Decorah, can start the route in Lansing.</p>
<p>Tourists know it for its view and for its bridge, named for the Sauk
chief whose cornered band was massacred by the cannons of a federal
steamboat in 1832, just up the river near Victory.</p>
<p>From Lansing, County Road X52 heads south, passing the lovely stone
Wexford Immaculate Conception Catholic Church, built by Irish immigrants
around 1868.</p>
<p>Rejoining the river at Harpers Ferry, the road continues to <a href="http://www.nps.gov/efmo">Effigy
Mounds National Monument</a>, where entry is
free.</p>
<p>Here, atop a rocky bluff, an ancient people left 195 ancient burial
mounds, remarkable because 31 are in the shapes of birds, reptiles and
mammals, including the 137-foot-long Great Bear Mound.</p>
<p>Eleven miles of hiking trails wind through oak and aspen forest on the
rim of the bluff, affording spectacular views.</p>
<p><strong>Marquette</strong> is three miles south, tucked
under the bridge to Prairie du Chien. A crossroads named for Father
Marquette, who claimed it for France when he and mapmaker Louis Jolliet
emerged from the mouth of the Wisconsin River in 1673.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>It's now known for its flea markets, winery and casino boat.</p>
<p>From Marquette, the highway hugs the foot of the bluff on its way to
McGregor, called the Pocket City because it's hugged by bluffs; some of
the shops on Main Street have back patios that end in sheer limestone.</p>
<p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mcgregor-iowa/">McGregor</a> is a conventional
tourist town, with B&amp;Bs, antiques shops and horse-drawn carriage rides
out of Triangle Park, but it also rewards those who relish the
unconventional.</p>
<p>See amazing sand &quot;paintings&quot; executed inside bottles by a local deaf
man who became the darling of his rich Victorian patrons, at the
McGregor Historical Museum, and stop by the <a href="http://www.riverjunction.com/">River Junction Trade
Co</a>., a general store for frontier-era
re-enactors.</p>
<p>Up U.S. 18, aluminum fishing boats venture in to see the glossy
stalactites of <a href="http://www.spookcave.com/">Spook Cave</a>, named for the
hollow sound of water splashing on rock.</p>
<p>The 500-foot bluffs above McGregor caught the eye of <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/zebulon-pike/">Lt. Zebulon Pike
in 1805</a>, when he
was scouting for fort sites. The fort instead was built across the river
on the Prairie du Chien flats, so Pike's aerie, now Pikes Peak State
Park, was turned over to tourists.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/e/f/effigy_mounds_boy_fall.jpg" alt="A boy plays in Effigy Mounds National Monument." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The trails of Effigy Mounds National Monument command a sweeping view of
the river valley.

<p>Its views of the river plain, from overlooks and 12 miles of hiking
trails, are mesmerizing.</p>
<p>From McGregor, it's a roller-coaster drive to <strong>Guttenberg</strong>,
a formerly stodgy village that has
become a riverfront belle.</p>
<p>Its sturdy limestone and brick warehouses and storefronts, built by
German immigrants before the Civil War, now house inns, one in a former
button factory and one in a brick house used as a courthouse.</p>
<p>Guttenberg always has been a great spot to linger, with its mile-long
city park lined with sugar maples that burst into reds and oranges in
autumn.</p>
<p>Lock and Dam 10 is here, and the Lockmaster's House Heritage Museum, the
last lockmaster's house on the Upper Mississippi.</p>
<p>Now, it's a bona-fide tourist magnet. Along River Park Drive, Kann
Imports draws collectors of name-brand crystal and figurines.</p>
<p>Across the street, in a picturesque stone warehouse, the Picket Fence
Cafe serves fine barbecued pork and beer-broiled brats from the
adjoining <a href="http://www.claytonridgefarm.com/">Clayton Ridge Farm Meat
Market</a>, which also sells gifts.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>From Guttenberg, U.S. 52 leads to Dubuque. It's scenic enough, but
County Road C9Y from Millville â€” watch for the round barn â€” follows
a ridge to <em>Balltown</em> and includes one of the most astonishing views in
northeast Iowa.</p>
<p>Just north of Balltown, the ground falls away just under the highway and
flattens into a bowl, rolling to the Mississippi two miles away.</p>
<p>In Balltown, <a href="http://www.breitbachscountrydining.com/">Breitbach's Country
Dining</a> has been serving fried
chicken and ham steaks since 1852. The oldest continuously operating
restaurant in Iowa, it occupied the original frame building until fire
destroyed it on Christmas Eve 2007.</p>
<p>Owner Mike Breitbach, whose family has owned it since 1855, replaced it
with a new restaurant resembling the original, and it reopened in June
2008. It burned again on Oct. 24, 2008, but again was rebuilt.</p>
<p>From Balltown, the road winds toward
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/dubuque/">Dubuque</a>, up the ridge to the stone
houses and brick churches of Sherrill, then down again. Like the whole
rolling stretch, it's ear-popping, as well as eye-filling.</p>
