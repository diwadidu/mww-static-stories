I have one every time I go there: Blues and bicycling.  Museums and dim sum. Skyscrapers and food tours. That's because the possibilities are endless.

Chicago is a mosaic, a city of neighborhoods settled by waves of immigrants who arrived to dig its waterways, build its railroads and work in its slaughterhouses.  One of its first neighborhoods was Bridgeport, settled by Irish canal workers in the 1840s and the stronghold of Mayor Richard J. Daley and his son Richard M. Daley, the current mayor.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/city-weekends/ethnic-chicago/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/cheap-trips/cheap-chicago/">Cheap Chicago</a></h2><h3>Here are 10 tips to make a trip affordable.</h3><p>These days, tourists have to compete with hordes of conventioneers and suburbanites fleeing back to the city.

Checaugou &mdash; for "swamp weed,'' or "wild onion.'' Then factories and slaughterhouses turned it into a sewer. At the confluence of the main branch with the north and south branches, Bubbly Creek was named for the methane gas that rose from decomposing carcasses on the river bottom.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/canoeing-chicago-river/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/chicago-architecture/">Skyscraper city</a></h2><h3>For skyscraper fans, Chicago is the place to walk and gawk.</h3><p>In Chicago, there's great people-watching &mdash; but the building-watching is even better. The city is best known for humongous buildings - the Willis (Sears) Tower, 875 N. Michigan Ave. (the Hancock Center), the Aon Center. But clustered around their knees are others that attract tourists from all over the world, buildings with so much flair it's tempting to give them personalities. There's Helmut Jahn's Thompson Center, the brassy showgirl with the heart of gold, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Federal Plaza, the geek with the thick black glasses.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/chicago/chicago-architecture/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/chicago-restaurant-food-tours/">Into the belly of Chicago</a></h2><h3>A food tour points us toward pizza, spice and everything nice.</h3><p>Once, Chicago was a meat-and-potatoes town, the City of Broad Shoulders. Chicagoans still brawl over who has the best deep-dish pizza and Chicago-style hot dogs, which come with no ketchup but so many condiments they're "dragged through the garden." But these days locals are just as likely to seek out  the best macarons and gelato, and on special occasions, they dine  at Michelin-starred restaurants with avant-garde chefs who are more Jeff Koons than Betty Crocker.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/chicago-restaurant-food-tours/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurant-tours-chicago/">Chow-down in Chicago</a></h2><h3>In a city of neighborhoods, cooks from many countries stir the pot.</h3><p>Chicago has come a long way since it was hog butcher to the world. There was nothing very appetizing about early Chicago. The factories and slaughterhouses that made it grow also made it stink. Rotting carcasses made the Chicago River bubble; a glass of water came with a side of cholera. But the city grew up. The immigrants who packed its meat, dug its waterways and built its railroads moved on and were replaced by new immigrants, who settled in places that became known as Little Italy, Andersonville, Polish Village, Ukrainian Village, Chinatown, Greek Town and Pilsen.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurant-tours-chicago/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/hotels-motels/best-hotels-chicago/">Where to stay in Chicago</a></h2><h3>Want to visit the Windy City?

A pirate skull was perched on the turnips the next morning at the farmers market, and we saw oversized ghouls and witches waving from the windows of mansions.
