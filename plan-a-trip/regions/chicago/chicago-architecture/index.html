<h2>For architecture fans, Chicago is the place to walk and gawk.</h2>

<p>In Chicago, there's great people-watching — but the building-watching
is even better.</p>
<p>The city is best known for humongous buildings - the Willis (Sears)
Tower, 875 N. Michigan Ave. (the Hancock Center), the Aon Center. But
clustered around their knees are others that attract tourists from all
over the world, buildings with so much flair it's tempting to give them
personalities.</p>
<p>There's Helmut Jahn's Thompson Center, the brassy showgirl with the
heart of gold, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Federal Plaza, the geek
with the thick black glasses.</p>
<p>Two Prudential Plaza is Miss Congeniality — Chicagoans were so bored
by Pru One that the company made Pru Two a twin of the beloved Chrysler
Building in New York. Philip Johnson's slick 190 South LaSalle is a
yuppie with too much money.</p>
<p>There's no sense being overly reverent about Chicago architecture;
Chicagoans themselves argue about it all the time. And who cares if the
guy who designed all those boxes is the greatest architect of the 20th
century?</p>
<p>I'm not exactly an idiot about architecture, which is to say I know a
dentil from a lentil — though, in truth, the two look much alike when
put in rows.</p>
<p>But after a few trips to Chicago, I was wondering: Why is Mies van der
Rohe so revered? What exactly <em>is</em>
post-modernism? Is that big red library old or new?</p>
<p>So I turned myself over to the volunteer guides of the Chicago
Architecture Center, who crisscross the city trailing flocks of
students. My first guide was Mary Gerding, to whom I confessed my
undeveloped palate for the glass-and-steel boxes of the International
style.</p>
<p>Luckily, she seemed to understand.</p>
<p>&quot;As I've learned more, I like it more,&quot; Gerding said. &quot;Before, I
would've walked through the Federal Plaza and thought, 'Huh.' &quot;</p>
<p>One Friday in June, 35 of us showed up at foundation headquarters on
Michigan Avenue for the two-hour Modern Skyscrapers tour, one of dozens
offered by foot, boat, bike, train and bus.</p>
<p>I attached myself to the group led by Gerding, who explained the
important dates in Chicago's architectural history.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_thompson_center.jpg" alt="Helmut Jahn's Thompson Center." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Helmut Jahn's brassy Thompson Center has drawn mixed reviews.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>In 1871, the city burned and had to be rebuilt, and in 1893, architects
vied to build pavilions for the Columbian Exposition, which brought 27
million visitors to town.</p>
<p>In 1955, the first &quot;big&quot; building went up after the architectural
drought of the Depression and Second World War.</p>
<p>On our way into the Loop, she pointed out the 1990 Pru Two, a
post-modern reaction to the severely boxy modernism of 1955's Pru One,
and the 1974 Aon Building, object of local derision because it began
shedding its marble skin less than a decade after it was built.</p>
<p>And we pondered the 1991 Harold Washington Library Center, built in the
Beaux-Arts civic style popular a century earlier, but with modernist
touches in its glass-and-steel attic and post-modern ornaments capping
its corners like Cubist gargoyles.</p>
<p>&quot;That's one thing the post-modernists will do, is take a decoration and
blow it out of scale,&quot; Gerding said.</p>
<p>Then we walked down Dearborn to Federal Plaza, built by Mies van der
Rohe, a German-born anti-Speer who rejected the fussiness and pomposity
of classical and Beaux-Arts edifices.</p>
<p>&quot;He thought beauty was in simplicity of scale, and the quality of the
materials used,&quot; she said. &quot;He's often quoted as saying, 'Less is
more,' and 'God is in the details.' &quot;</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>We all gazed at the building, black I-beams clamped all over its glass
surface. There was another glass box next to it, and a third across the
street: Huh.</p>
<p>The 1957 Inland Steel Building was a glass box, too, but elegantly clad
in stainless steel across which light moved in shimmering waves. That
was a box we could love: &quot;It's a favorite,&quot; Gerding confirmed. &quot;I love
that building.&quot;</p>
<p>We moved on to Bank One, a curving glass tower that seems to flare out
at the top, and to the Daley Center, with a Picasso sculpture that the
architects finally coaxed out of the famous artist through gifts of
Cubs, White Sox and Bears trophies and an Indian headdress.</p>
<p>And then we came to Helmut Jahn's 1985 Thompson Center, a glass hut with
coral and turquoise panels and a plaza that features a disappearing
archway and a Jean Dubuffet sculpture that locals call &quot;Snoopy in a
Blender.&quot;</p>
<p>Inside, shops and offices ringed a 17-story atrium.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been described as visually noisy,&quot; Gerding said. &quot;But a lot of
people love this building. It's like a building for the common man; you
don't feel you have to be dressed in a three-piece suit.&quot;</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_architecture_jahn.jpg" alt="Tourists look at Chicago architecture." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Hmmm. Later, on the foundation's lakefront bike tour, I heard that
ventilation problems at the Thompson Center turn it into an oven, and
that, at a volunteer dinner there, rain from the leaking roof fell on
Jahn's table.</p>
<p>On the river cruise, I found out that Jahn himself works in a little
domed aerie atop the 1926 Jewelers Building, a neo-baroque tower on the
river.</p>
<p>In Chicago, locals have taken architecture seriously ever since the sale
of its first home, built by black trader Jean Baptiste Point du Sable
after his arrival in 1779.</p>
<p>&quot;John Kinzie bought the du Sable shack, added pillars to the front and
called it the Kinzie Mansion,&quot; said guide Don Wiberg. &quot;That started the
trend of everything in Chicago having to be the biggest and the
fanciest.&quot;</p>
<p>Wiberg and his wife, Joyce, wearing &quot;The City Is Our Museum&quot; shirts,
were our guides on the three-hour Lakefront by Bike tour.</p>
<p>We started at the 1916 Navy Pier, reopened in 1995 with a Ferris wheel,
carousel, shops, restaurants and cruise-boat moorings and now hugely
popular.</p>
<p>From there, we rode beyond the Ohio Street Beach to Olive Park, where we
gazed upon glittering buildings lining a shore that was underwater until
a character named George Streeter paid contractors to dump their debris
there and then, with his new land, seceded from the city.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/h/chicago_tribune_tower.jpg" alt="Trump and Tribune towers in Chicago." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>We rode past the lock that controls the flow of Lake Michigan, source of
the city's drinking water, into the Chicago River. The river, also the
city's sewer, flowed into the lake until residents began dropping dead
of cholera, and in 1900 the river was reversed.</p>
<p>We rode all the way to Grant Park, known as &quot;Chicago's front yard,&quot;
where the annual Blues Fest was in progress.</p>
<p>There, the Wibergs told us how Montgomery Ward spent 20 years fighting
the city and his fellow businessmen to keep the lakefront open to the
public, and about the next-door Millennium Park, with its Frank Gehry
bandshell, super-popular sculptures and pedestrian bridge.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing is ever finished in Chicago,&quot; Don Wiberg said wistfully. &quot;It
makes you want to live to be 150 to see it all.&quot;</p>
<p>I got another view of the city from the top deck of Chicago's Little
Lady, one of the launches on which the Architecture Foundation gives its
popular 1½-hour river cruises.</p>
<p>With guide Karen Luckritz at the helm, we traveled all the way from
1673, when Marquette and Joliet took a shortcut back to Lake Michigan on
the Chicago River, to 1964, when the corn-cob Marina City apartments
were built as a response to urban flight.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Today, suburban dwellers are fleeing back, snapping up riverside condos
and lofts in converted warehouses and offices.</p>
<p>&quot;There's huge demand,&quot; she said. &quot;Everyone wants to live here, so close
to the Loop.&quot;</p>
<p>Along the way, we could see how Chicago became the stage on which
American architectural aesthetics evolved. We saw the neo-Gothic Tribune
Tower, based on Rouen Cathedral and the winner of an international
design competition held in 1922.</p>
<p>We saw the sleeker Art Deco tower based on Eliel Saarinen's second-place
entry and the dark curtain wall of the 1971 IBM Building, Mies van der
Rohe's last glass box.</p>
<p>&quot;After Mies came in 1938, we had no more references to monarchies and
cathedrals,&quot; Luckritz said.</p>
<p>Those are back now, enlivening Miesian frames with Beaux-Arts pediments
and Art Deco curves and Prairie-style urns. Post-modern is the order of
the day, although, this being Chicago, anything goes.</p>
<p>I'm still no expert on architecture. But thanks to my crash course, I
now see that Chicago's glittering skyline is much more than a pretty
face.</p>
