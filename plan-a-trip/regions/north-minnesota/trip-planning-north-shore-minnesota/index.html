<p>If you don't know much about Minnesota's North Shore, trip-planning can
be confusing.</p>
<p>For one thing, it's really the west shore of Lake Superior. People in
Ontario don't get confused because they live on the real north shore.
Chicagoans do get confused because they call their northern suburbs the North Shore.</p>
<p>This pointy corner of Minnesota also is called the Arrowhead Region.
Some people call its roads by their names — Sawbill and Caribou —
and some by their numbers — County Road 2 and County Road 4.</p>
<p>Some people heading north along the shore say they're heading east, and
they're right.</p>
<p>Even if you know exactly where you are, it's still hard to plan a trip
to the North Shore: There's so much to see and do, and everything passes
in a flash.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>When I head up the shore, I take a blue fold-out brochure called North
Shore Drive of Lake Superior, which lists the main attractions by mile
marker, from 0.0 (Duluth's Canal Park) to 151.0 (the Canadian border).</p>
<p>Want to make sure you don't zoom by Palisade Head? It's at Mile Marker
56, two miles past Silver Bay.</p>
<p>Getting Temperance and Tettegouche state parks mixed up? Tettegouche is
2½ miles beyond Palisade Head, and Temperance is 22 miles further, just
past Schroeder.</p>
<p>Published since 1937, my favorite blue brochure has been discontinued,
so I guard my remaining copies jealously.</p>
<p>This scenic highway, also a <a href="https://fhwaapps.fhwa.dot.gov/bywaysp/byway/11185/map">national scenic
byway</a>, is hallowed
ground to Minnesotans and many people in surrounding states. If you're
planning a trip but are overwhelmed by the choices, here are the places
you may want to see — along with mile markers.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/o/north_shore_scenic_byway.jpg" alt="North Shore Scenic Drive map." /><p class="copyright">&copy; America's Byways</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

<p>In summer and fall, make sure you have a <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/north-shore-lodgings/">place to
stay</a>. For more on
hiking, skiing, dining, lodging and sightseeing, see our large <a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/north-shore/">North
Shore section</a>.</p>
<h3>The beginning</h3>
<p><strong>0.0 Canal Park in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/lake-superior/best-duluth-minnesota/">Duluth</a>.</strong>
Tourists now flock to the part of town once filled with seedy bars and old
warehouses. They can't resist watching giant ore boats head into the
harbor under the Aerial Lift Bridge, or strolling along the Lakewalk as
sea gulls screech for handouts.</p>
<p>There's shopping at DeWitt-Seitz Marketplace, cool exhibits in the
Marine Museum, boat excursions to take from the harbor and train rides
from the nearby Depot.
<a href="/plan-a-trip/family-friends/travel-with-kids/duluth-kids/">Kids</a> love it
all, especially jumping on the rocks.</p>
<p><strong>5.1 Lester River.</strong>  The beautiful park
along this river once was a weekend destination for city folk. The
nearly 1-mile Lester Park Trail follows the river, off Superior Street
and 61st Avenue East. In summer, you'll find some of Duluth's great
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/water-sports/swimming-holes-duluth-rivers/">swimming
holes</a>. In
winter, the park has superbly groomed ski trails.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong>5.2 <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/north-shore-scenic-highway/">Scenic
61</a>.</strong> Just
beyond Duluth's Kitchi-Gammi Park, also called Brighton Beach, turn
right and take the scenic route to Two Harbors. In June, it's the route
for Grandma's Marathon.</p>
<p><strong>13.1 <a href="https://www.newsceniccafe.com/">New Scenic Café</a>.</strong>  This sunny
little spot is a good place to stop for coffee and fruit pie (among the
region's best) or a meal.</p>
<p><strong>15.0 Stony Point.</strong> Watch for the turnoff
to a one-mile drive that hugs a point. It's known for giant waves and
the surfers who congregate to catch them.</p>
<p><strong>20.0 Knife River.</strong> You can buy smoked
fish in this little fishing village, and there's also a darling candy
store, plus a campground and marina.</p>
<p><strong>24.0 <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/visiting-two-harbors-minnesota/">Two
Harbors</a>.</strong> Don't whiz past — turn right and go down to Lighthouse Point to see
the North Shore's only real lighthouse, now an inn, and walk the
enchanting Sonju Trail. If you're lucky, you'll see an ore boat being
loaded.</p>
<p>In the downtown area, stop in the convivial taproom of Castle Danger Brewing for a cold one.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/o/gooseberry_falls_girls.jpg" alt="Kids play at Gooseberry Falls." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Gooseberry Falls State Park is a favorite place to play year-round.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<h3><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/scenic-byways/gooseberry-to-tettegouche/">The near shore</a></h3>
<p><strong>36.0 <a href="https://rusticinn.cafe/">Rustic Inn Cafe</a>.</strong> For the feel of
the old North Shore, stop for a bite in this 1920s log-cabin cafe, most
famous for its pies.</p>
<p><strong>39.5  <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/gooseberry_falls/index.html">Gooseberry Falls State
Park</a>.</strong> It doesn't cost anything to park here and see the falls, which makes
this the most-visited state park except for Fort Snelling in the Twin
Cities.</p>
<p>Kids love clambering around on the rocks; bring water shoes. If it's a
warm day, follow the river down to its mouth and you'll find a good
spot to <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/swimming-holes-beaches-duluth-north-shore/">swim in Lake
Superior</a>. The falls also are fun to visit in
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/gooseberry-falls/">winter</a>,
when they're frozen.</p>
<p>From here, you can ride the paved <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_trails/gitchigami/index.html">Gitchi-Gami State
Trail</a> to
Split Rock Lighthouse and Beaver Bay.</p>
<p><strong>43.5 Split Rock River.</strong> From the parking
area, there's a great five-mile hike up the west side of the river and
around, a rare loop on the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-north-shore/">Superior Hiking
Trail</a>.</p>
<p><strong>46.0 <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/split_rock_lighthouse/index.html">Split Rock Lighthouse State
Park</a>
and <a href="http://www.mnhs.org/places/sites/srl/index.htm">Historic
Site</a>.</strong> The picturesque
yellow lighthouse is a National Historic Landmark, one of only two Great
Lakes lighthouses to get the designation.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p>Built after the <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/north-shore-shipwrecks/">Mataafa Blow of
1905</a> damaged 29
ships on Lake Superior — sinking the Madeira on Gold Rock, just across
the cove — it became a tourist favorite after the highway was paved in
1924.</p>
<p>The state park has hiking trails, a beach and the best views of the
lighthouse. Sites at the campground, tent and hike-in only, are the
hardest to get in the state.</p>
<p><strong>50.0 Beaver Bay.</strong> This busy little town
is the home of the <a href="http://www.beaverbayagateshop.com/">Agate Shop</a>, a
good place to see spectacular examples of the state gemstone, and many
places to eat.</p>
<p><strong>51.0 Beaver River.</strong> The beach at the
mouth of this river is one of the best places to <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/beaches/finding-agates/">look for
agates</a>.</p>
<p><strong>54.0 Silver Bay.</strong> On the south end of
Black Beach Park, there's a scenic black-sand beach that's nice for
picnics. On the other side of the highway, <a href="https://www.northshoreadventurepark.com/">North Shore Adventure
Park</a> is a high-ropes course
with ziplines.</p>
<p>In the hills above town, the 11-mile stretch of the Superior Hiking
Trail from <a href="http://shta.org/trail-section/silver-bay-to-caribou-river-wayside/">Silver Bay to Minnesota
1</a>
is one of the most scenic (and most challenging), passing Bean and Bear
lakes in Tettegouche State Park, Round Mountain, Mount Trudee and High
Falls on the Baptism River.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/s/p/split_rock_close_up.jpg" alt="Split Rock Lighthouse on Minnesota's North Shore." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
Split Rock Lighthouse has always been a tourist landmark.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>You can also see Bean and Bear lakes on a great day hike that starts
from the Silver Bay information center, the 7.6-mile Twin Lakes Trail
loop.</p>
<p><strong>56.0 Palisade Head.</strong> It's a steep drive
up to this clifftop with a spectacular view down the cliff-lined shore
to Shovel Point. Bring a picnic — and watch your kids.</p>
<p><strong>58.5 <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/tettegouche/index.html">Tettegouche State
Park</a>.</strong>
Park for free in the lot and walk the half-mile trail to Shovel Point,
where basalt headlands form a coastline that looks more like northern
California than Minnesota. The view, which includes Palisade Head to the
south, is incomparable.</p>
<p><strong>60.2 Minnesota 1.</strong> This is how you get
to Illgen Falls and <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/tettegouche-state-park-cabins/">Illgen Falls
Cabin</a> in the upper
part of Tettegouche State Park. Go a little farther and you'll reach
the town of Finland, <a href="http://www.wolf-ridge.org/">Wolf Ridge Environmental
Center</a> and <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/george_crosby_manitou/index.html">Crosby-Manitou State
Park</a>
(on County Road 7).</p>
<p>Keep going through Superior National Forest and you'll reach Ely.</p>
<p><strong>71.3 Caribou River.</strong>  A 1½-mile trail
leads to Caribou Falls. In winter, this is a good
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/snowshoeing/snowshoeing-north-shore/">snowshoeing</a>
route.</p>
<div class="ad-right"><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><!-- InText --><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:300px;height:250px"  data-ad-client="ca-pub-9146426679298298" data-ad-slot="6743431184"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div>
<p><strong>73.0 <a href="http://www.sugarloafnorthshore.org/">Sugarloaf
Cove</a>.</strong> This nature preserve is one
of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/best-trips/favorite-places/hidden-places-north-shore/">secret
spots</a>
on the North Shore, where you still can see all the stones and cool
stuff that used to be on all North Shore beaches before people carted
them away for landscaping.</p>
<p>A one-mile interpretive trail winds through a red-pine plantation and
alder thicket to a U-shaped cobblestone cove and crosses an old tombolo
on a boardwalk. In the log nature center, interpretive staff give
Saturday programs.</p>
<p><strong>79.0 Cross River.</strong> There's a lovely
waterfall here, best seen from Lamb's Resort and Campground on the
south side of the river. There's also a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/schroederbakingcompany/">bakery</a> and the Cross
River Heritage Center.</p>
<p>On the north side of the river, a road leads to <a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadside-attractions/father-baraga-cross/">Father Baraga's
Cross</a>.</p>
<p><strong>80.4 <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/temperance_river/index.html">Temperance River State
Park</a>.</strong>
Trails at this park, named because the river has no bar at its mouth,
follow the tortuous course of the Temperance River, seething and
twisting like a flume ride from hell. Pebbles in the swirling water have
scraped potholes in the riverbed and in the sides of the gorge.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/p/a/palisade_head_fall.jpg" alt="Palisade Head in fall." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The best view of Shovel Point is from Palisade Head.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>A lot of people swim here, but you shouldn't — some have drowned.</p>
<p>Park trails lead into the Superior Hiking Trail. It's a three-mile hike
to Carlton Peak, whose 924-foot summit commands a spectacular view up
and down the shore.</p>
<h3>Skiing and hiking central</h3>
<p><strong>82.4 <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/superior/recarea/?recid=36907">Tofte U.S. Forest Service ranger
station</a>.</strong>
Pick up Boundary Waters permits and information on local hikes.</p>
<p><strong>83.0 Tofte.</strong>  This formerly quiet fishing
village is the home of the large Bluefin Bay Resort and its <a href="https://www.bluefinbay.com/dining/coho-cafe">Coho
Cafe</a>, a good place
to stop for a sandwich, pizza or dessert.</p>
<p><strong>83.4 Sawbill Trail/County Road 2.</strong>  This
23-mile trail, roughly following the Temperance River, ends in Sawbill
Lake, an entry point to a quiet part of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/carlton_peak_family.jpg" alt="A family of hikers enjoys the view from Carlton Peak." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A family of hikers enjoys the view from Carlton Peak.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Three miles up the trail, you'll reach the <em>Britton Peak</em> trailhead of
the Superior Hiking Trail. From here, it's a three-mile round-trip to
Carlton Peak.</p>
<p>Britton Peak also is the main trailhead for the
<a href="http://www.sugarbushtrail.org">Sugarbush</a> ski-trail system, one of the
best places to <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/ski-north-shore-minnesota/">cross-country
ski</a>
in winter. The Moose Fence is farther up the road on the right.</p>
<p><strong>87.0 Onion River Road/Forest Road 336.</strong>
This is how you get to the trailhead for the very popular two-mile
<em>Oberg Mountain</em> hiking loop, where frequent overlooks give hikers views
of the lake and inland maple forest.</p>
<p>It's two miles uphill to the parking area. From the other side of the
parking area, the Superior Hiking Trail leads to Leveaux Mountain. It's
a one-mile hike to a spur trail that goes to the summit.</p>
<p>The parking area also is a trailhead for the
<a href="http://www.sugarbushtrail.org">Sugarbush</a> ski trails in winter.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/o/b/oberg_lake_view.jpg" alt="View from Oberg Mountain." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
The Oberg Mountain loop trail is very popular.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong>90.1 <a href="https://www.lutsenresort.com/?__trackcampaign=ZGJYG8Y6">Lutsen
Resort</a> and
<a href="http://www.lutsen.com">Lutsen Mountains</a>.</strong>
Turn toward the lake to get to this historic resort at the mouth of
the Poplar River.</p>
<p>It's a great place to stay, but you also can enjoy the view from the
window-lined restaurant, have a drink in front of the wood-burning fire or
wander on the beach.</p>
<p>Turn inland and you're on the ski hill. In summer, take a few rides
down the <a href="https://www.lutsen.com/summer/alpine-slide/">Alpine Slide</a> or
hike east on the Superior Hiking Trail to Lake Agnes.</p>
<p><strong>92.0 Caribou Trail/County Road 4.</strong>  This
is one way to get to the trailhead for <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/superior/recreation/recarea/?recid=41628&amp;actid=50">Eagle
Mountain</a>, the highest point in Minnesota. Drive to Forest Road 153, then  four
miles east to the trailhead.</p>
<p><strong>99.8 <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/cascade_river/index.html">Cascade River State
Park</a>.</strong>
The trails that hug both sides of the river are gorgeous, especially in
spring, when they're lined by wildflowers.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/c/a/cascade_falls.jpg" alt="A waterfall on the Cascade River." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">
A series of waterfalls line the Cascade River.
</figcaption></div></figure>
<p>Don't miss the Upper Cascade, where the trail is lined with old cedars
and feathery ferns and hikers can sit on the shore watching the river
tumble over a series of small falls.</p>
<p>It's a challenging but very beautiful eight-mile round-trip up the
river to the County Road 45 bridge and back down the other side.</p>
<p><strong>104.0 Good Harbor Bay/Cutface Creek wayside.</strong>
This is a good place to look for
Thomsonite, a semiprecious gemstone with bands of pink and green that
formed out of a single lava flow. It's only found here, along a
six-mile stretch of shoreline.</p>
<h3>Heading into town</h3>
<p><strong>110.0 <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/grand-marais-minnesota/">Grand
Marais</a>.</strong>
This harbor village has everything a tourist could want: shopping,
restaurants, hotels, festivals, nightlife.</p>
<p>Be sure to walk out to the harbor light on the breakwall and to
Artists' Point, where narrow trails lead through cedars and spruce.
Children love playing in the rocks between the point and the old Coast Guard
station.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/g/r/grand_marais_light_station.jpg" alt="The light station in Grand Marais." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

harbor.

<p><strong>110.5 Start of the <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/gunflint-trail/">Gunflint
Trail</a>.</strong>
This 57-mile road, also a <a href="https://fhwaapps.fhwa.dot.gov/bywaysp/byway/13548/map">national scenic
byway,</a> is lined by
resorts, some of them on lakes that lead into the Boundary Waters Canoe
Area Wilderness.</p>
<p>The road heads north, then west, and dead-ends near the Canadian border.
It doesn't connect to Ely except by obscure gravel forest roads.</p>
<p><strong>114.0 Devil Track River.</strong>  On the rim of
this deep, narrow canyon is a 2.4-mile stretch of the Superior Hiking
Trail, with views of the red cliffs and waterfalls below. The river
itself is a favorite
<a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/snowshoeing-north-shore/">snowshoeing</a>
destination in winter.</p>
<p><strong>118.7 Kadunce Creek/River.</strong>  A trail
follows the rust-tinted waters of the Kadunce through its narrow gorge.
It's a spectacular and intimate little hike, 1½ miles round-trip, and
the cobblestone beach opposite the wayside is one of the shore's
prettiest.</p>
<p><strong>123.8 <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/judge_cr_magney/index.html">Judge C.R. Magney State
Park</a>.</strong> Trails in this park, named after the populist who proclaimed, &quot;Our
state parks are everyman's country estate,&quot; follow the Brule River
past three waterfalls: the Lower, the Upper and Devil's Kettle.</p>
<p>At the Devil's Kettle, the river splits, half cascading 50 feet into a
pool and the other disappearing into a pothole; no one know where it
ends up. It's 2½ miles round-trip.</p>
<figure class="story-image"><div class="image-content"><img src="/media/images/n/a/naniboujou_winter.jpg" alt="Naniboujou Lodge is a landmark on the North Shore." /><p class="copyright">&copy; Beth Gauper</p><figcaption class="figure-caption">

</figcaption></div></figure>
<p><strong>124.0 <a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/naniboujou-lodge-minnesota/">Naniboujou
Lodge</a>.</strong> This striking
lodge was built in the heyday of the Jazz Age, just before the
stock-market crash. Today, it's a quiet retreat, one of the best
<a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/classic-cabins/north-shore-lodgings/">places to stay on the North
Shore</a>.</p>
<p>The restaurant in the Great Hall, painted with vivid Cree-style designs,
is open to the public. It's especially popular for Sunday brunch.</p>
<p><strong>145.0 <a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/frontier-history/visiting-grand-portage/">Grand Portage National
Monument</a>.</strong>
This re-created North West Company post at the end of an 8½-mile big
detour — the <em>grand portage</em> — around
rapids on the Pigeon River once was the center of the fur-trade
universe.</p>
<p>Costumed interpreters show visitors around. On a typical day, they can
watch historic weapons being fired, hear a bagpiper, try on the clothing
of the fur trade, play voyageur games and see a canoe being built.</p>
<p>Admission is free. Down the road, the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/grpo/planyourvisit/grand-portage-national-monument-heritage-center.htm">Heritage
Center</a>
highlights Ojibwe culture and contributions to the fur trade.</p>
<p><strong>145.0 <a href="http://www.isleroyaleboats.com/">Boat service to Isle
Royale</a>.</strong>  From the Grand Portage
marina, ferries take tourists to <a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/isle-royale-national-park/">Isle Royale National
Park</a>. It's a long way to travel for a day trip — three hours each way to
Windigo — but same-day round-trip fares are available.</p>

<p><strong>150.8 <a href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/grand_portage/index.html">Grand Portage State
Park</a>.</strong>
The Pigeon River, which marks the international border, is the largest
on the North Shore and was the bane of voyageurs.</p>
<p>Its lower 20 miles, a series of cataracts and chasms, is unnavigable, so
the paddlers had to make an 8½-mile uphill portage before they could
travel into the interior.</p>
<p>Today, visitors can follow a half-mile, handicapped-accessible trail to
the state's tallest waterfall, gorgeous High Falls, cascading 120 feet
over a sheer basalt wall. The Middle Falls Trail goes farther, over
ridge tops, about three miles.</p>
<h3>The border and beyond</h3>
<p><strong>151.0 Canadian border.</strong>  This is the end
of Minnesota and the beginning of Ontario, which is on Eastern Standard
Time, an hour later. If you <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Canada.html">cross into
Canada</a>, make sure you have a <a href="http://travel.state.gov/">passport</a> (and no
drugs, guns, Mace or other weapons).</p>
<p>From the Ontario visitors center, you can hike a trail to the top of
High Falls, for a spectacular view up and down the Pigeon River.</p>
<p><strong>190.0 <a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/thunder-bay-summer/">Thunder
Bay</a>.</strong>  This
sprawling port town isn't pretty (except around the marina in Port
Arthur), but there is a lot to do, and it has great places to eat.</p>
<p>Want to keep going? The scenery doesn't end here.</p>
