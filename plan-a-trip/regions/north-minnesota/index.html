It's in every gravel pit, along every railroad track, on every beach. All you have to do is look to find a Lake Superior agate, Minnesota's official state gemstone.

It's a little chilly, for one thing. But the port city has six miles of sandy beach along the largest freshwater sandbar in the world. Just over the Aerial Lift Bridge, Park Point is where Duluthians play. They hike and run on a two-mile trail through forest and dunes. They paddle canoes and kayaks.

They're impressive when spotted overhead. But up close, it's easier to get to know a bird &mdash; say, the northern goshawk, a fierce predator whose image once adorned the helmet of Attila the Hun.
