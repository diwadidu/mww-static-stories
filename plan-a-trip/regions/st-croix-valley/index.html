Once, legions of unkempt lumberjacks mobbed the streets of Stillwater, spending their wages at saloons and bordellos. Now, mobs of weekend tourists roam through town, sipping cappuccinos, sampling wine and shopping for gifts and antiques.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/st-croix-valley/historic-stillwater-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/antiques/swedish-towns-minnesota/">Sweden in Minnesota</a></h2><h3>Prowling antiques shops around Lindstrom, visitors find a beloved heritage.</h3><p>Walking around Lindstr&ouml;m, it's not hard to guess where the area's first settlers came from. If the multitude of umlauts don't give it away, the herds of Dala horses and straw goats will. Factor in the giant white coffee pot in the sky, and you can be pretty sure this is Swedish country.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/antiques/swedish-towns-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/hudson-wisconsin-attractions/">Getaway on the St. Croix</a></h2><h3>An easygoing Wisconsin river town has a treat for every visitor.</h3><p>From the beginning, the St. Croix River has shaped Hudson's identity. The first settlers came by canoe on the fur-trade highway. The first steamboat docked in 1847, and soon logs were floating down the St. Croix to sawmills in Hudson and its neighbor on the Minnesota side, Stillwater.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/hudson-wisconsin-attractions/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-stillwater-minnesota/">Bargain-hunting in Stillwater</a></h2><h3>In this St. Croix river town, shops harbor all kinds of treasures.</h3><p>When spring is a tease and days are gray, only one sport always comes through: Shopping.  And where better to shop than Stillwater? The little village on the Minnesota side of the St. Croix River has a Main Street that's chockablock with antiques, books and bibelots from around the globe, filling every inch of storefronts once occupied by the blacksmiths and haberdashers and apothecaries of the logging era.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/shopping-towns/shopping-stillwater-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/seven-lakes-trail-wisconsin-/">Savoring the Seven Lakes Trail</a></h2><h3>A leisurely ride in western Wisconsin yields scenery, serenity and ice cream.</h3><p>Most people think bicyclists ride for exercise. But really, it's for the ice-cream stop. In western Wisconsin, the Stower Seven Lakes between Dresser and Amery, has everything you'd want on a bicycle trail. It's got scenery. It's got beaches and picnic spots.  And in Amery, it has the soda fountain of your dreams. Just look for the place with all the people.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/seven-lakes-trail-wisconsin-/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/stcroix-falls/">Trail mix in St. Croix Falls</a></h2><h3>For hikers, bicyclists and paddlers, this river town is a crossroads.</h3><p>It's the western terminus of the 1,000-mile Ice Age National Scenic Trail, which traces the last glacier as it began to melt and retreat northward, leaving a marvelously lumpy patchwork of rock, rubble and river gorges.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/stcroix-falls/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/taylors-falls-minnesota/">Sightseeing on the St. Croix</a></h2><h3>Thanks to glaciers, Taylors Falls is the Pothole Capital of the World.</h3><p>There's only one place in the Midwest where potholes are a tourist attraction instead of a nuisance. Standing at the bottom of the 35-foot-deep Bake Oven, touching walls as smooth as vinyl, it's easy to imagine the scene 10,000 years ago, when sheets of water from a melting glacier roared past Taylors Falls, into what now is the St. Croix River Valley.  They came with such fury that whirlpools laced with sand and gravel drilled cylindrical holes into solid rock &mdash;  potholes, the world's deepest.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/outdoors-towns/taylors-falls-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/ski-minnesota-state-parks/">A Minnesota snow sampler</a></h2><h3>For skiing and snowshoeing, four state parks along I-35 are as up north as you need to be. </h3><p>For some people, Interstate 35 may as well be a pneumatic tube linking the Twin Cities to Duluth and the North Shore. But those willing to stop and get off the beaten track are rewarded.  In four state parks, skiers, snowshoers and snowmobilers glide along miles of trails on the St. Croix, Kettle and St. Louis rivers, once plied by lumberjacks and quarrymen.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/winter-play/ski-minnesota-state-parks/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/wild-river-cabin/">Snug on the St. Croix</a></h2><h3>In Minnesota's Wild River State Park, a guesthouse lets guests dwell in comfort amid 7,000 acres of beauty.</h3><p>In the middle of Minnesota's Wild River State Park, a ski's length from 35 miles of groomed trails and a 10-minute trek from the St. Croix River, sits a cozy little house surrounded by forest. For one winter night, the two-bedroom, carpeted house, a private residence built not long before the park was established in 1978, belonged to me and my children. We arrived at dusk, and my children swarmed over it as only children can do, giving a running commentary: "Boy, this is a nice cabin," said my son Peter. "Wow, a nice shower. Isn't this great? And oh, look" &mdash; he peered out the window at a big thermometer &mdash; "you can tell the temperature."</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/wild-river-cabin/">Go to story ...</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - 2022 all rights reserved</p></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
