Frank Lloyd Wright built a bank, hotel and house there in 1908-09, and the locals loved his Prairie style so much it commissioned houses from four of his associates. Today, it's one of the best collections in the nation. Wright became persona non grata in Mason City after he abruptly left for Europe with his married lover. But a musical virtuoso was growing up nearby. Meredith Willson's "The Music Man," inspired by Mason City and its band, became a Broadway smash in 1957.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/arts-culture/art-architecture/wright-hotel-mason-city/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/decorah-iowa-norwegian-heritage/">A pocket of Norway</a></h2><h3>In northeast Iowa, Decorah still is Norwegian after all these years.</h3><p>Of all the immigrant groups, Norwegians perhaps are most sentimental.  Generations later, they're still painting bowls and stitching costumes in the old style and celebrating holidays with foods poor Norwegians ate in the 19th century.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/decorah-iowa-norwegian-heritage/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/amana-colonies/">Truly Amana</a></h2><h3>The busiest of Iowa's seven Amana Colonies is both a living historic monument and a shopping destination.</h3><p>It's obvious from one look at the shop-lined streets of Amana, the largest of the seven Amana Colonies, that modern commerce is in full flower there. Even so, the first question asked about the villages is: Are the Amana people Amish? And no wonder &mdash;  the people of the Amanas spoke German, lived simply and adhered faithfully to Scripture. Many still do. But no, they never were Amish.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/amana-colonies/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/pella-tulip-time-festival/">Tulip Time in Pella</a></h2><h3>In central Iowa, the Dutch celebrate colorful origins.</h3><p>Even in a region rich in ethnicity, the Dutch stand out. In a town square in Iowa, lacy white hats shaped like pyramids, horns and half-moons bob high atop women's heads. Men wear black caps, breeches or baggy trousers and narrow bands cross at their throats. Their wooden shoes click and clack as they dance. "These are the weirdest people I've ever seen!'' shrieked a little boy watching from the sidelines.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/pella-tulip-time-festival/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/kalona-iowa-amish-organics/">Kalona, naturally</a></h2><h3>In southeast Iowa, the Amish find common ground with those who value a grassroots lifestyle.</h3><p>For the Amish, that's a lifestyle, not a movement.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/ethnic-towns/kalona-iowa-amish-organics/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/hoover-west-branch/">West Branch's 'wonder boy'</a></h2><h3>An Iowa village tells the story of Herbert Hoover, the international hero who became a scapegoat.</h3><p>Poor Herbert Hoover. Orphaned at age 9, he spent his childhood picking potato bugs, weeding onions and cleaning barns. His first job after graduation from Stanford was shoveling ore.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/history-heritage/historic-houses/hoover-west-branch/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-iowa-trails/">Bicycling in Iowa</a></h2><h3>Quietly, this low-profile but ambitious state has piled on miles of trails.</h3><p>It's not as flat as people think, and it has an excellent network of paved county roads.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/bicycling/bicycling-iowa-trails/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/clear-lake-iowa/">Clear Lake tranquility</a></h2><h3>In a laid-back Iowa beach town, the '50s never ended.</h3><p>This northern Iowa lake town, midway between the Twin Cities and Des Moines, swells with vacationers in summer but retains the laid-back, carefree air of decades past. On the shores of the lake, classic cars cruise around pocket-sized City Park, fuzzy pink dice dangling from mirrors. Every Saturday and Sunday, the municipal band plays in the bandshell. The Lions Club grills chicken and sweet corn, and a paddlewheeler takes tourists on cruises.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/lake-towns/clear-lake-iowa/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/great-river-road/northeast-iowa-fall/">One fall swoop</a></h2><h3>The roller-coaster hills and riverside bluffs of northeast Iowa yield a photo album of panoramas.</h3><p>Long before the second-growth forests of Minnesota and Wisconsin's north woods became fall destinations, sightseers were flocking to northeast Iowa. Flat? Hardly. In this part of Iowa, only the river is flat. Towering bluffs line the Mississippi, providing unparalleled views of the sprawling river plain.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/regions/great-river-road/northeast-iowa-fall/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-decorah-iowa-harmony-minnesota/">Table-hopping in bluff country</a></h2><h3>On a culinary adventure to Decorah, we tighten our belts, then let them out.</h3><p>Sometimes, we like to travel like kings . . . and paupers, too. I suspect a lot of other people do the same thing. To get what we want, we save on something else. Our favorite splurge is eating out, but a meal for two in a really good restaurant costs $80-$100, same as a hotel room. Our solution? We pitch a tent.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-decorah-iowa-harmony-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-wineries-amana-colonies/">Eating in the Amana Colonies</a></h2><h3>In eastern Iowa, a historic village has a long tradition of feeding people well.</h3><p>Before 1932, the pious, hard-working people of the Amana Colonies were the only people in Iowa who got to eat out every night.  Butchers, brewers and winemakers turned out goods for everyone, and meals were served in 50 communal kitchens.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/shopping-eating/dining/restaurants-wineries-amana-colonies/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/iowa-state-park-cabins/">A cabin in Iowa</a></h2><h3>Spectacular scenery lies at guests' feet in a resort-like state park.</h3><p>What a way to spend a weekend: hiking up and down ravines, clambering on rock, admiring views of water from ridgelines. "It's like hiking on the North Shore," my husband said. But it wasn't Lake Superior's North Shore. It was Iowa. And everyone knows Iowa is one big, flat cornfield.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/iowa-state-park-cabins/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/yurts-state-parks/">A yurt on an Iowa lake</a></h2><h3>A weekend stay on an Iowa lake is so simple, it's hardly camping.</h3><p>One June, I was a very lazy camper.  I threw a sleeping bag and pillow into the car and drove two hours down Interstate 35 to Clear Lake, Iowa. I didn't bother to solicit company; in early June, most people where I live want to go north, not south.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/camping/yurts-state-parks/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/hotels-motels/hotel-pattee/">Perry's palace</a></h2><h3>A gorgeous, art-filled boutique hotel sits in the middle of Iowa, complete with spa, bowling alley and restaurant.</h3><p>In 1997, a small-town damsel who married a prince &mdash; well, an heir  waved a silver wand over her hometown of Perry, Iowa, and unusual things began to happen.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/hotels-motels/hotel-pattee/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/nordic-fest-decorah/">Nordic nirvana</a></h2><h3>Every July, Decorah puts on one of the best fests in the Midwest.</h3><p>First, an elf sashayed down the street. bunads, the traditional Norwegian folk costume, and two shaggy little boys wearing the long noses, beards and tails of trolls.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/festivals/nordic-fest-decorah/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/dubuque-iowa-sightseeing/">Destination: Dubuque</a></h2><h3>A once-shabby Mississippi River port town in Iowa now is a tourists' playground.</h3><p>For much of its existence, Dubuque, Iowa, has been a little short on charisma. It started out well, with a lead-mining boom and eight breweries and Victorian mansions filled with millionaires. But it faded into obscurity. For years, its last brewery sat empty next to the 1856 Shot Tower, where laborers once turned molten lead into bullets and cannonballs by dropping it through screens into cool river water.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/dubuque-iowa-sightseeing/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mcgregor-iowa/">Memorable McGregor</a></h2><h3>A picturesque river town in Iowa claims more than its share of attractions and oddities.</h3><p>Over the years, the byways around McGregor, Iowa, have seen an extraordinary procession of people. Between 650 and 1300, Woodland Indians built animal-shaped burial mounds, 29 of which are preserved nearby at Effigy Mounds National Monument.  In 1673, Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet arrived via the Wisconsin River, claiming the land for France and paving the way for the fur trade, whose center was just across the river in Prairie du Chien.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/mcgregor-iowa/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/lansing-iowa-mississippi/">Lansing on the Mississippi</a></h2><h3>Blessed by topography, a quiet Iowa river town has one of the best views on the Mississippi River.</h3><p>Tucked into the tip of northeast Iowa, Lansing has been overlooked for a long time.  Lansing was the county seat until 1867, when a posse from Waukon stole the county records. And it was a boom town in the 1870s and '80s, when farmers beat a path to its grain elevator and levee.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/mississippi-river/lansing-iowa-mississippi/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadtrips/burr-oak-spillville-decorah-iowa/">Road trip: Northeast Iowa</a></h2><h3>In the scenic bluffland around Spillville, Decorah and Burr Oak, extraordinary people lived and worked.</h3><p>There's something inspiring about a certain pocket of northeast Iowa. It's nurtured a a beloved children's-book author, a famous composer and two brilliant woodcarvers. It's stirred battalions of people who create art, preserve heirloom seed and carry on Norwegian culture. There are a lot of stories in these hills and valleys on the edge of the Driftless Area, which escaped the flattening effects of the glaciers.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/touring/roadtrips/burr-oak-spillville-decorah-iowa/">Go to story ...</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - <span id="cyear"></span>  all rights reserved</p><script>document.getElementById('cyear').innerText = new Date().getFullYear();</script></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
