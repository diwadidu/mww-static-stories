He's one of the world's largest black bears, at 850 pounds, but he doesn't throw his weight around. When a fellow bear doesn't want to play, he merely whines, "like a foghorn,'' says curator Donna Phelan. And when he wants to make friends, which is all the time, he makes a "wonderful amiable sound, an umph-umph-umph.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/ely-bear-center/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/orr-bear-sanctuary-minnesota/">Beguiled by bears</a></h2><h3>In northern Minnesota, the man who loved bears left a legacy for thousands.</h3><p>Half a century ago, a Minnesota logger who lived in a forest full of hungry bears decided that if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. By the time he died at age 86, Vince Shute had fed generations of black bears, become best friends with a bear named Brownie and inspired bear-lovers all over the world. Shute wasn't a sophisticated man, but he had a heart.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/birds-wildlife/orr-bear-sanctuary-minnesota/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/voyageurs-park-boating/">Land of big water</a></h2><h3>On vast Rainy Lake in Voyageurs National Park, a little horsepower is a good thing to have.</h3><p>At the top of Minnesota, there's a spectacular national park &mdash; half water and all scenery. Not only is it beautiful, but it's also the only national park Minnesota has, which you'd think would impress most people. But not, apparently, some of the locals. My husband and I found that out two minutes after we'd arrived on Rainy Lake and were chatting with the friendly young woman checking us into our B&B.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/nature/national-parks-wilderness/voyageurs-park-boating/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/gunflint-trail-winter/">Snow heaven on the Gunflint Trail</a></h2><h3>On the edge of the Boundary Waters, cross-country skiers find snow that sparkles into April.</h3><p>While people in cities to the south are looking for crocuses, folks on northeast Minnesota's Gunflint Trail are enjoying some of the best skiing of the year. It's not that the Gunflint is so much colder. It's that there's so much snow it keeps itself refrigerated, like glaciers. "We have a really good base,'' says Heather Telchow of Golden Eagle Lodge. "Even after these warm days, the snow is like brand new. I grew up in Faribault, and I'm used to it disappearing in a few days. But we don't lose snow like that up here. We keep it forever.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/gunflint-trail-winter/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/yurts-ski-gunflint-trail/">From yurt to B&B on the Gunflint Trail</a></h2><h3>In a snowy Minnesota wilderness, guests get the best of two worlds.</h3><p>When it's 30 below in the north woods, that's nothing like a cold day in Siberia. It's more like a cold day in Mongolia. Temperatures were dangerously low over New Year's when we drove with friends to the  Gunflint Trail, but we knew a wood fire would be waiting for us in a round, canvas-sided hut called a yurt, or ger in Mongolia.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/cross-country-skiing/yurts-ski-gunflint-trail/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-border-route-trail/">Trying out the Border Route</a></h2><h3>On eight great day hikes, sample the magnificent scenery from this 65-mile wilderness trail. </h3><p>In Minnesota canoe country, hikers get serious bragging rights by backpacking the Border Route Trail. This 65-mile trail roughly parallels the Ontario border, mostly through the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. The volunteers who maintain it can't use mechanized tools there, and signs aren't allowed.  Navigation isn't easy, and hikers frequently have to dodge blown-down trees.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/hiking/hiking-border-route-trail/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boundary-waters-tips/">Minnesota's Boundary Waters</a></h2><h3>For paddlers, this vast wilderness is the promised land.</h3><p>Along Minnesota's northern border with Canada, more than 200,000 people a year find an increasingly rare commodity &mdash; absolute wilderness.  Today, the foot trails over which they carried canoes and 180-pound packs are used by vacationers, who wind their way from lake to lake in search of the perfect combination of woods, water and solitude.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/outdoors-recreation/paddling/boundary-waters-tips/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/ely-guesthouse/">Ensconced in Ely</a></h2><h3>A guesthouse overlooking Bear Head Lake is just one of the hideaways in Minnesota state parks.</h3><p>In Bear Head Lake State Park near Ely, there are three places to spend the night: a tent, one of five rustic camper cabins and a modern split-level. On a subzero day in winter, one is better than the others.</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/cabins-cottages/ely-guesthouse/">Go to story ...</a></li><li><h2><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/gunflint-lodge-trail/">A Gunflint legend</a></h2><h3>In Minnesota canoe country, a historic lodge draws skiers, paddlers and nature-lovers.</h3><p>At the Gunflint Lodge, every new luxury burnishes the legend of the rough-hewn outdoorswoman who made them possible. Justine Kerfoot was a 22-year-old college student when the stock market crashed in 1929. Her family lost their Illinois home and lake cottage, so she gave up medical school and moved to the family fish camp at the edge of the Boundary Waters. "We were green people who came in from the outside and didn't know anything about anything,'' she said in a 1997 interview. "I just bulled it through.''</p><a href="/plan-a-trip/stay/lodges-resorts/gunflint-lodge-trail/">Go to story ...</a></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="footer"><div class="footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/plan-a-trip/">Plan A Trip</a></li><li><a href="/about/">Meet Us</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/events-policy/">Events Policy</a></li><!--li: a(href="/apps/contact.html") Contact us--><li><a href="/advertising/">Advertising</a></li></ul><p>&copy; Beth Gauper, 2007 - 2022 all rights reserved</p></div></div></div><div class="site-msg-container" id="web-compoment-msg"><div class="msg-outline"><p>Your browser does not support our events calendar page.
